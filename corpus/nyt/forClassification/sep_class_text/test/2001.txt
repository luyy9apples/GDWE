shanghai , july 12 china s communist party celebrated its 80th anniversary this month as the gap widens between its increasingly anachronistic pronouncements and the reality those words struggle to describe nowhere is that paradox more pointed than at the site of the party s founding meeting in a few years , according to current development plans , the building in which mao and 14 comrades plotted the eradication of capitalism will be part of a small graybrick island surrounded by office towers bearing the names of some of the biggest multinational corporations already the modest graybrick house sits in the middle of a new upscale entertainment quarter designed by ben wood , one of the architects behind the restoration of faneuil hall in boston , otherwise known as the cradle of liberty one block behind the communist party site , a starbucks serves frozen lattes , and one block in front , a mcdonald s will soon be serving burgers the few square blocks of the entertainment quarter , dubbed new heaven and earth by vincent lo , the hong kong property tycoon behind the project , is just one corner of his company s huge 129acre redevelopment plan the project is transforming the heart of old shanghai from a teeming proletarian residential neighborhood into a landscaped corporate park and luxury housing complex where private homes will sell for millions of dollars henry cheng , who oversees the project for mr lo , said no one in the government had mentioned to him the obvious incongruity of the birthplace of chinese communism cradled in capitalism s mighty palm but he said the city had gone to great lengths to ensure that none of the planned highrises would be visible from the doorstep of the first congress meeting hall , the current name of the building where the first chinese communists met the view will be blocked by the secondstory roof lines of the surrounding buildings , deliberately preserved to give the impression of an intact neighborhood the contradiction is not lost , though , on many of the local residents being forced to make way for the urban renewal just one block from the founding meeting site , song houfu , a laidoff factory worker , sat in his shabby oneroom apartment on the second floor of a halfdemolished building and groused about how the party has changed i'm a true communist , mr song said , combing his long , yellowed fingernails through his shoulderlength gray hair i 've been trying to join the party for 20 years , but they say my opinions are too far from the party line mr song , 55 , lives with his wife and 20yearold daughter in a 260squarefoot room clothes hang from a line above an old television set the kitchen is a gas burner on the greasecoated landing outside his door inside the room , mr song has built a sort of loft where his wife and daughter sleep each night he sleeps on a worn sofa he said it is wrong to surround such an important party shrine with so much capitalism , though he did not oppose development in general he concedes that his neighborhood could use some improvements we still wash our chamber pots out on the street , he said that does n't look very good when the leaders come to visit the first congress site his real complaint is with the compensation the city is offering him to leave he wants to stay in the centrally located neighborhood rather than move to the outskirts of the city where the government is offering him an apartment the government has offered him money instead , but it is far too little to buy a place in the same area once the development is done they want to buy from me at plannedeconomy prices but sell to me at marketeconomy prices , he complained , smiling wryly in fact , mr song has little choice but to accept the government s offer like most chinese under the country s socialized housing scheme , he does not really own his room , which was provided by the staterun chemical factory where he used to work , but only the tenuous right to live there by the end of next year , a massive office tower will sit where mr song sits now he has seen truckloads of police officers arrive at the homes of other holdouts to supervise the packing of their meager belongings , which are carted off to distant apartment blocks the city has already moved scores of families to make way for the restaurants and shops that now stand around the party s birthplace most recently it relocated 3 , 800 families in just 43 days to raze 10 acres for a lake and a park that will some day divide the area s highend offices from its highend housing the city wanted the lake finished before the party s birthday it has not said how many families will have to move before the project is complete mr lo s development company would have also torn down the old buildings immediately surrounding the party s first meeting place , had it not been not encouraged to preserve the integrity of the block so that the site would not look entirely abandoned instead , the company dismantled nearly five acres of graybrick buildings typical of the city s 1920 s architecture , cleaned the bricks , dug foundations , installed septic tanks and rebuilt the buildings in their original style , though their interiors are now spacious and modern and house some of the city s trendiest shops vidal sassoon has opened a hair styling salon in the quarter , and jackie chan has opened a restaurant so while busloads of political pilgrims as many as 5 , 000 a day troop through the room where the communist party is said to have held its first meeting on july 23 , 1921 , and ogle such party memorabilia as a pair of mao s white cotton swimming trunks \( with an 80inch seat \) , chinese yuppies and western expatriates get fancy haircuts and eat expensive overdesigned cuisine just one or two buildings away few senior party leaders see any of this in action when jiang zemin , china s president and communist party chief , visited in midjune , the entertainment quarter was emptied and handpicked locals were sent to stroll through its streets to give the place a more proletarian feel photo construction under way in shanghai of an entertainment quarter , new

with its storied wealth and excellent schools , it s no surprise that westchester county sends dozens of high school graduates to prestigious and expensive universities like columbia and wesleyan but by a startling margin , the no 1 destination of the county s public school graduates is westchester community college , where the tuition is a mere 2 , 350 a year a survey of 27 high schools by the westchester section found that last year , 610 seniors went to westchester community college , almost five times the number who went to the second most popular choice , the state university of new york in albany , which drew 129 next on the list was pace university , with 113 iona college , with 92 and suny oneonta , with 72 in fact , of the top 19 colleges on the list , only one boston university is not in new york state among ivy league schools , cornell was by far the most popular , with 55 , followed by the university of pennsylvania , with 33 at first glance , these figures might seem unexpected , given the county s reputation for affluence and the ambitions of its highachieving parents but to those who advise high school students on the college application process , the results were predictable not everybody here goes far away and spends oodles of money , said susan dickson , assistant director of guidance at rye high school within westchester , there is a huge diversity factor you 've got families in milliondollar homes , and people who are renting , so you 're going to have a wide disparity in colleges even at horace greeley high school in affluent chappaqua , which sent 26 seniors to ivy league colleges more than any other school that participated in the survey cost is important we forget how expensive education is , and if you 're earning 60 , 000 a year , you do n't have 35 , 000 to spend on college , said penny oberg , chairwoman of the counseling department at horace greeley the suny s and wcc are the best value we will frequently meet parents who say , 'i 'll pay for harvard , not hamilton' so it s not surprising that the suny s are popular to get a picture of where westchester students go to college , the westchester section asked the guidance departments at all 43 public high schools in the county to provide data about the class of 2000 most schools responded some , like scarsdale and dobbs ferry , declined to participate others , like pleasantville , ossining and mount vernon , sent lists describing where their students were accepted , but not where they actually enrolled the survey did provide some surprises for example , six students from the county went to palm beach community college in florida , the same number that went to rockland community college and hudson valley community college , much closer to home to the massachusetts institute of technology , and to mcgill , the prestigious university in montreal guidance counselors said palm beach attracts students who want a sunny climate and who have relatives in florida as scott maclachlan , dean of enrollment management for palm beach community college , explained we find that most students from the north have relatives in palm beach county typically , grandparents or the noncustodial parent of a divorce some students are intrigued by the thought of going to college in sunny south florida he said the college also has student housing by and large , however , the survey found that westchester students like to stay close to home juniors will say , 'i'm going to go to california , ' ms oberg said , and seniors will say , 'i 'd like to be on the east coast' added carol gill , president of carol gill associates , an educational consulting firm with offices in dobbs ferry and boston it s true that kids are staying in the midatlantic region i have more and more parents and students telling me that they want to be within a three to fourhour drive in keeping with national trends that indicate that more students are seeking urban schools , boston university , new york university and syracuse university were popular with westchester students , as was george washington university some students also ventured farther afield , to places like the university of colorado , the university of miami and arizona state university highly selective colleges like duke , brandeis and georgetown each enrolled more than a dozen students from the county in total , ivy league universities enrolled 165 westchester students , including 25 at columbia , 14 at harvard , 13 at brown , 10 at dartmouth , 10 at yale and 5 at princeton few guidance counselor were surprised that among the ivies , cornell and the university of pennsylvania attract so many westchester graduates cornell has 14 , 000 undergraduates in its various divisions , compared with yale s 5 , 200 and penn s freshman class of 2 , 385 means that there are potentially many more slots than at some of the smaller universities in addition , cornell has significant cost advantages for new york state residents because it is a land grant institution and some of its units , like the college of agriculture and life sciences and the school of industrial and labor relations , receive state financing in those schools annual tuition and fees for a state resident is 12 , 062 \( excluding room and board \) , compared with 26 , 062 at other schools , like the college of arts and sciences
at first glance , it looks to be the most elaborate productplacement deal since madison avenue was a dirt road during the 10 parts of band of brothers , the world war ii miniseries that began running last night on hbo , there are so many scenes featuring the vehicles now sold under the jeep brand name by the chrysler group division of daimlerchrysler that no one from hbo or chrysler seems to have an exact count however many there are estimates range from 600 to more than 1 , 000 none , it turns out , are the result of product placement the jeeps are there for historical verisimilitude in that they represent the myriad vehicles built in the 1940 s by willysoverland for the allied war effort but the serendipitous timing of hbo s wanting to promote a miniseries filled with jillions of jeeps just as chrysler wants to promote the 60th anniversary of the military jeep united the two for a deal centered on what is the first commercial sponsorship ever for hbo the partnership is emblematic of the increasing role being played by entertainment in advertising and vice versa as marketers and media conglomerates seek nontraditional methods to draw attention to their products and programming people are looking for ideas and not ads , said peter arnell , chairman and chief executive at the arnell group in new york , an omnicom group agency , who brought together daimlerchrysler , the largest omnicom client , and hbo that is particularly true now , he added , when the clients are asking 'is this the best way to spend my money \? ' if they have money hbo is spending more than 10 million on a promotional campaign for band of brothers , which includes television , print and outdoor advertising and displays the jeep logo next to this sentence the jeep brand is honored to celebrate the men of easy company the soldiers whose battles are depicted in the miniseries and all those who served in wwii the legacy of the product is perfectly linked up with the series , said eric kessler , executive vice president for marketing at hbo in new york , part of aol time warner , because jeep is organic to the story , an integral part of the war if it did n't fit , he added , it would n't have made sense for either of us chrysler is reciprocating by spending 5 million to 15 million on a campaign for jeep based on band of brothers , including six commercials to run on broadcast tv networks as the miniseries appears on hbo the spots , produced by arnell with tony to , coexecutive producer of band of brothers , mention the miniseries by name along with hbo one spot , which begins running tonight , recreates dday on utah beach in normandy , france , and was even shot there the other five excerpt scenes from episodes of band of brothers in which jeeps play prominent roles this is more of a touchstone to our brand values and heritage than it is to try to sell jeeps , said jeff bell , vice president for marketing communications at chrysler group in auburn hills , mich that attitude helped allay concerns at hbo about overcommercializing the presence of jeep in the miniseries , he added , as did the decision to have mr to direct the commercials also , the plans for the spots were reviewed and approved by tom hanks and steven spielberg , the executive producers of band of brothers all of us who worked on this feel protective of it and its integrity , mr to said , so for us this was the right approach if we were n't comfortable with jeep and peter , we would not have done it , he added there was a lot of trust involved mr kessler at hbo described mr to s involvement as essential , adding everything is in the execution and here we think the execution works very well still , critics of commercialism may raise eyebrows at some elements of the partnership for instance , the first commercial begins with the sequences recreating dday on utah beach , dissolves to an empty beach and ends with three presentday jeeps parked on the same patch of beach we discussed it quite a bit , mr bell said of the ending , and concluded that it conveyed an appropriate message that jeep was here then and is still here the plans for the remaining five spots do not include shots of contemporary jeeps though i'm sure there might be some skeptics dismayed about the first spot , mr arnell said , i do n't think celebrating is commercialization nobody is dancing around the fact everybody involved is involved in commerce , he added , but the campaign is intended in part to celebrate the power of commerce back here on the home front to help the allies win the war and mention of the victors of course brings to mind the vanquished , particularly germany , whose battles against the allies in 194445 compose the story line for band of brothers though the formation of daimlerchrysler in 1998 was portrayed as a merger of the american automaker chrysler , which owned jeep , and the german automaker daimlerbenz , the company has its headquarters in germany and the top executives who run it are based or come from there so was jeep s decision to become associated with a miniseries about world war ii like a decision by cunard to sponsor a telecast of titanic \? we absolutely discussed it very openly , mr bell said of chrysler group executives who included dieter zetsche , the new chief executive dispatched from germany to run the division , and james c schroer , who heads sales and marketing if we were n't to participate when jeep appears one thousand times in 10 hours , it would look stranger , he added , like we felt we had something to hide mr arnell said i do n't know if it s relevant that was then and this is now things change in the world it s now one world it s jeep in war , and now in peace photo new jeeps on utah beach for an ad tied to band of brothers \( arnell group \)
madugahawatte , sri lanka in this lush and placid village , no mortar fire disturbs the breezy nights , and only stars and a plump moon light up the sky trees are heavy with bananas , coconuts and jackfruit but bounteous nature is matched by hard times good jobs are so scarce that many poor young men like k w perera have gone to war for a paycheck his mother , a petite , careworn woman , said he had enlisted against her wishes he tried the garment factories , construction sites , road work , she said he joined up when he found nothing else the 18year ethnic conflict that has set sri lankan against sri lankan has become enmeshed in the economic fabric of village life it has brought a better standard of living to families of many of the more than 200 , 000 men and women , mostly from the sinhalese majority , who have signed up to fight rebels seeking a separate tamil homeland there are now more than five times as many people employed in the security forces as there are in the tourism industry of this island nation off the southern tip of india and as military spending has grown from 1 percent of the economy before the war began in the early 1980 s to 68 percent last year , more and more people are making a living from the conflict the war has become an institution , said a western diplomat based in colombo , the capital rich people are making money on commissions , kickbacks , selling supplies to the army the soldiers are fairly well paid too everybody seems to be making money it s a highly democratic system though the war has killed 62 , 000 people in a country with a population of 19 million , there is no mass movement of people taking to the streets to demand that the government and the rebels make peace many reasons are offered for this , among them the ruthlessness of the rebels , the despair of a warweary people , the isolation of the sinhalese south from the carnage of the northern battlefields there is also the very intractability of the conflict between a government that insists on holding the country together and a rebel force that seems determined to divide it but some say the crucial economic role of the military as employer is another factor that has sapped organized opposition to the war in the countryside , where most people live it diminishes the potential to mobilize rural communities against the war , because they are deriving substantial economic benefits , though at tremendous human cost , said jehan perera , a spokesman for the national peace council , a group that favors a negotiated settlement and the numbers in service are large though the army has had trouble at times attracting new recruits for the minimum 12 years , and though it has a chronic problem of deserters , the security forces , which include the army , air force , navy and police , still number 215 , 000 , according to the united states state department the sri lankan military declined to say how many people served , citing security concerns the villagers offer their own twist on explanations of what is prolonging the war with no universal draft , they say , it is the offspring of the poor , not of the elite , who are volunteering to serve the children from the villages are fodder , said lance cpl gamini premaranthna , who joined the army 11 years ago when he was 19 none of the bigwigs' children go all the politicians shouting that we must have a military solution do n't have sons in the war it s only the village boys the war would end sooner if the rich were dying too this peaceful village in the south , home to 50 or so families who have sent 25 men into the security forces , seems utterly distant from the warravaged jaffna peninsula in the north the soldier , k w perera , a native of this village , stood alone under the baking sun with a gun slung over his shoulder one recent morning , a grim sentry in the northern war zone , yearning for home as he gazed at the ruined town of chavakachcheri , wrecked by shelling , he said , this destruction is a national crime but the war is helping his village to prosper through the money that young soldiers like him send home they are paid quite well by local standards , and the job security is unmatched while garment factories in the area often fold , the war goes on a soldier posted to jaffna , in the war zone , earns about 140 a month , two to three times as much as a typical garment worker and if he is killed in action , his family will be paid his salary until he would have been 55 , and a pension after that k w s lakshman perera , k w perera s second cousin , joined the police force just days out of school and had the lower part of his left leg blown off four years ago when he stepped on a mine in a town near rebel territory he said he had no regrets about his service he seems to be surviving nicely on his salary , which he continues to earn though he has never gone back to work he and his wife recently had a second child and have built a spacious home in the shade of towering palm trees there is glass in the woodframe windows and a studio photograph of his 2yearold boy in the living room one recent afternoon , he hobbled playfully after his son later he bathed outside , pouring big buckets of water over himself , then hopped back to the house to get dressed and put on his leg he led the way to the nearby homes of neighbors who had sent their sons and husbands to war corporal premaranthna was on leave to visit his wife and 3yearold son in a new house they were building his childhood home , built by his father , a day laborer , was a mud hut with coconut fronds for a roof the son s new place is made of bricks the roof is tin topped with tiles the interior is decorated with flowered curtains and his wife has planted a papaya tree and pink roses in the front yard he said he is determined to return to duty in jaffna though it is in the war zone , the hazard pay is worth the risk it s very difficult to survive on the salary you earn in the south , he explained the last stop on k w perera s tour of the village was the saddest night had fallen and the moon shone gently on k w gunesekera , an old , shirtless man in a plaid loincloth who came out on his step to talk both his sons joined the army a year ago , his youngest boy , just 22 lance cpl mahinda dayawansa was killed in an ambush mr gunesekera s wife was lost after her son s death she had no more desire to live , he said she was forever lamenting our son she went to sleep one night and did n't awake i lost my son i lost my wife the young man never married , so his family will collect his salary for the next 32 years but the money is no comfort to mr gunesekera he brought out the framed certificate the army sent after his son perished , clutching it to his bony chest photos k w perera stands in the ruins of chavakacheri , far from his home in the south jobs are few and the young man went to war for a paycheck k w gunesekera , above , is desolated after

john baxter may have coined the most honest campaign slogan of all this political season if i get elected to the city council , mr baxter said , i doubt i can change anything mr baxter , a former democrat turned republican turned independence party candidate , is one of at least nine people seeking the council seat in the 32nd district , one of the largest and most incongruous in the city it is divided by jamaica bay and consists of the west end of the rockaway peninsula broad channel howard beach , which is primarily italian and jewish and parts of ozone park , with its large east indian population but it is the rockaway peninsula that has the most intractable problems 18 percent unemployment , more than its share of the borough s facilities for the mentally ill , 50 percent of its nursing homes , more than 5 , 000 units of public housing and an uneasy racial mix and even if he cannot change anything in the rockaways , mr baxter said , he can do no worse than his predecessors he has made a name for himself on the peninsula as a muckraker and a hellraiser , and he rates his chances for the council as fair there are three factors working in his favor , he said one is the lack of name recognition among the many candidates in this , the first termlimited election in new york city two is his takenoprisoners , takenocontributions approach to politics three is the uneducated voter i am registered with the independence party , he said capital i a lot of firsttime voters might think , 'hey , i'm an independent thinker , too , ' and pull the lever for me mr baxter is an old irish import who first washed up on the shores of rockaway beach in 1954 with songs of whiskey in his head , yeats in his heart and an impenetrable sense of right and wrong he is the proprietor of the baxter hotel , on beach 116th street in rockaway park his establishment has often been referred to by both friend and foe as a flophouse , a fleabag and an sro his detractors say the hotel , and its shabby clientele , are a drag on the commercial strip of beach 116th street , and they would like to see it torn down and him blow away the barnlike hotel was built in 1837 as a rooming house with a fish store on the main floor nothing much has changed there are still 34 rooms rented upstairs and , though the fish store is gone , there is still a stink wafting from the first floor the stink is raised by none other than mr baxter himself everybody hates me in rockaway , mr baxter said the other morning in the back of the cluttered lobby , which smelled of sea salt and old furniture mr baxter converted the rear area into a theater and television studio mr baxter is a playwright and stage producer whose latest work ran in his hotel lobby last season the title was the packy mccracken s traveling show , a oneact play that depicted neighborhood politicians as dirt bags , he said there is no other way to say it but it all winds up good in the end mr baxter , 52 , is also the host of john baxter presents , a cableaccess television show that skewers local personalities , politicians and the police it is also a platform for his latest theories the politicians have turned the

kids to do the politicians sold us out and the only thing to do is to secede from new york city to show that his call for confederacy is no harebrained scheme for attention , mr baxter shoved a ream of photocopied documents into a visitor s hand he scrounged them up in the municipal archives on chambers street in manhattan , the address of which he has committed to memory the papers are dated march 11 , 1915 , and they have the look of official state legislation the papers say that the rockaway peninsula was to be incorporated into a city of its own the city stole the whole peninsula , it s as simple as that , he said in a county cavan brogue we formed a committee last thursday night and we 're going to secede there is bargaining power in that , he added mr baxter has made a career of throwing stones when his hotel caught fire four years ago , he accused local politicians of arson he once owned a small newspaper , the rockaway press when he was sued for libel by the director of the local ymca , the advertising dollars dried up , and mr baxter folded the paper for lack of money he has called the residents on the west side of the peninsula , most of whom are white , racists for their refusal to allow beach visitors to park on public streets the list goes on the political climate has never been better than now , mr baxter said of term limits it s time to sweep the thieving rats out of office and put someone in who at least wo n't run the working man out i 've said a lot of things and they 've never been able to stop me , because what i 've said is true jonathan gaska , district manager for community board 14 , feels that he has long played macduff to mr baxter s macbeth when called for comment , mr gaska giggled are we on the record \? mr gaska asked yes , he was told well , mr gaska said , and paused for a moment baxter s report card as a child probably said 'johnny is a bright little boy , but johnny does n't get along with others' mr baxter takes pride in that reputation if they loved me something would be wrong , he said all i want is equality on earth then he made his first and only campaign promise if i do n't do the right thing in office , i 'll throw rocks at myself photo john baxter , queens cable host and independence party candidate for city council , in his hotel everybody hates me in rockaway , he said \( aaron lee fineman for the new

bradford , england , june 1 william hague did not seem depressed he did not seem disheartened as he swept through this gray northern town or at least through a twoblock section of it on an election swing today , he did not even seem worried it was an impressive performance , because the main question facing the conservative party , of which mr hague is the leader , is how thoroughly it will lose the election on thursday in the last few days , with polls showing the labor government with an 18point lead over the conservatives , the talk in tory circles has turned from possibly eking out a surprise defeat of the government to merely blocking labor from winning too large a parliamentary majority with the race revving up as the candidates prepare for the final sixday push , the expectations of many conservatives are ratcheting down writing in the daily telegraph today , former prime minister margaret thatcher warned that if labor s majority widened too much , britain would be saddled with an overweening government sustained by cronies , ciphers and a personality cult and chris patten , the former tory chairman , is reportedly prepared , if the conservatives lose many more seats , to denounce mr hague s relentlessly antieurope stance as divisive and counterproductive but loser that he seems , mr hague tried his best to act like a winner today we are working very hard for victory , he said jauntily the campaign is going very well what well means is a matter of opinion the most vexing question facing mr hague and the conservatives is why , when britons are unhappy about so many things footandmouth , the state of services like health , education and the railways and the perception that they are being hit by a range of backdoor taxes more have not rushed to embrace the tories as a viable alternative perhaps the answer lies in a deepseated resentment of the conservatives , built up during the long years of margaret thatcher and her successor , john major or perhaps it has something to do with the tory party today , split as much as ever over how much or how little to embrace europe and an eventual switch to a common currency as party leaders go , mr hague is not the most statesmanlike at the age of 40 , he has an almost imperceptible layer of fuzzy fair hair on either side of a broad bald crown that rests atop an incongruously infantile face in photographs , he gives the impression of being a teenager dressed up as an important politician , although his voice , resonant with deep yorkshire cadences , helps make him a powerful speaker and formidable debater but those who are neither hardcore conservatives nor passionate hague partisans can find his charms elusive hague gets a lot of stick for the way he looks , but he looks better in person than he does on tv , said azhad ramzan , a financial consultant who listened to mr hague speak this afternoon to a group of muslims about diversity and multiculturalism i feel sorry for him , mr ramzan said , referring to the recent polls but you never know what s around the corner after the speech , sara nero , an administrator in a recruitment company , said that mr hague gives a bad name to yorkshire and that she was put off by almost everything about him , including his policies , his manner and his oratory she is not thrilled with labor , either , and is considering casting a protest vote for a fringe party people are stuck on whom to vote for , she said , because they do n't like any of the parties for whatever reason , mr hague did not meet any members of the public today , traveling the oneblock distance between his two speeches in a sleek black limousine that made some bradford residents unhappy , particularly a small band of representatives of the socialist alliance , who chanted , william hague is a tory loser , in the rain outside his second speech he s talking to a select group of supporters , said ann morgan , 35 , who added that none of the candidates had addressed the real issues that confront the city wages , services and jobs he s not interested in talking to ordinary people there was no question that after he went inside , mr hague was preaching to his friends as 400 supporters clapped and cheered , he repeated familiar criticisms of the labor government they included that it has sneakily imposed new taxes , that it has abandoned its pledges on health care , law and order and education , that it has made britain too popular a destination for refugees and that it is robbing the country of its identity by ceding sovereignty to a federal europe i am not choosing my words lightly when i say this could be the last general election of its kind , mr hague said , the last time that the people of the united kingdom are able to elect a parliament which is supreme in this country the speech thrilled michael waters , 51 , a local party official who said he had heard just what he wanted to hear he said all the right things on the european union , the single currency , and national independence , mr waters said i think william hague is extremely impressive in person photos william hague and his wife , ffion ,

altavista , a popular online research aid , has upgraded its software to prevent personal information about people using its services from being inadvertently transferred to internet marketers , attorney general eliot l spitzer of new york said yesterday mr spitzer discussed the service s action in announcing the settlement of a case in which many altavista users' home or work addresses were sent to an internet marketing service , which was a violation of altavista s own privacy policy mr spitzer s office and altavista agreed that altavista had not been aware of the transfer , which it said had stemmed from a flaw in the software it used in its online yellow pages directory altavista agreed to pay 70 , 000 in penalties and for the cost of the state s investigation an altavista spokesman , david emanuel , said that the unintended transfers occurred during a twomonth period in late 1999 , that the software problem had been quickly fixed and that none of the addresses had gone from the marketing service to an advertiser joseph p fried \( nyt \)
dear diary a former new yorker on a quick vacation in manhattan , i decided to walk to the sheep meadow to watch a little bit of central park action and soak in one of the city s premier views after an hour or so of lounging and watching the frisbee action and yoga classes , i spotted a man pushing a grocery cart and realized the afternoon would not be complete without a beer i was second in line , behind a young woman with a thick german accent obviously a tourist , she accepted the 5 change the vendor offered her from her 10 bill , despite the fact that he was hawking the beer for only 3 she also seemed to enjoy , as i did , watching the man wrap up our 16ounce cans in pages of an adulteducation catalog , supposedly to fool any police officer who wandered by i took my beer , smiled at the young woman and sat down a few feet away when i finished my drink , i got up to leave and as i walked by , she held out a small camera with one hand , her beer in the other , and said , please , take a photo of me doing something illegal chris farber lil rubin s 13yearold grandson , daniel banker , has a penchant for both poetry and stylish teenage coiffures he recently left a poem on his desk , apparently for anyone s perusal the passionate tribute to his current girlfriend ended i love you 99 percent the other 1 percent is for my hair dear diary a public address announcement heard by my friend bob de luna at the subway station at 33rd street and lexington avenue due to an earlier incident , the 2 , 3 , 4 and 5 trains are running on schedule this was somewhat bizarre in that none of those trains actually stops there needless to say , the no 6 local , the regular resident of that station , was not running on time daniel gil feuchtwanger carol zuckerman was walking into gramercy park recently when she and others spotted a live chicken , partly hidden by the low bushes the aspca was called , but its representative said it did n't handle chickens then 911 was called , and when the operator stopped laughing , she said that the emergency service , too , did not handle chickens after some conversation , a police officer was dispatched , and he called for backup eventually , ms zuckerman reported , eight officers were running through the park chasing the chicken they left victorious one of them with bird in hand the city in summer the crowds have been leaving for a month , maybe more it s been off to the mountains and off to the shore well , enjoy your vacations , farewell to you all see you again at the coming of fall meanwhile for us , the tried and the true , we remain in manhattan and proclaim entre nous that new york in summer \( you seem not to know \) is the in place to be for wherever you go , no more crowds , no more hustle or waiting in line life is easy , accessible , truly sublime so chic and elite that whatever the heat the city in summer by some higher rule is transcendently rare and incomparably cool jacqueline berke dear diary my husband and i live in poughkeepsie , ny , and were recently invited to a party in midtown manhattan to celebrate the 93rd birthday of our soninlaw s grandfather en route , we stopped at the newyork historical society and , amazingly , found an empty parking space on west 77th street when we left the museum , it occurred to us that a taxi ride downtown would be less expensive and less of a hassle than trying to find another parking spot there some 30 blocks later , in the taxi , i realized that although i was dressed to the nines , i had sneakers and mickey mouse socks on i had left my dress shoes in the car we were stuck in traffic on fifth avenue , several blocks from the restaurant , when i spotted a shoe store with a huge clearance sign in the window i hopped out of the cab , leaving my husband to deal with the driver ran into the store s lower level found a pair of shoes in a suitable style and correct size and dashed upstairs to pay for them \( boy , that did n't take long , said an amazed salesman \) we arrived at the party on time , properly shod i love new york no matter what the time and no matter what one needs , it s readily available the shoes cost more than parking would have , but then again , i could n't take the parking place home and use it again and again mary b heller dear diary on my way home from work , everyone on the crowded and hot subway car traveling from 49th street to union square seemed tired and irritated at one stop , a homeless man entered and started begging for change most people turned away and ignored him except one handsome young man who seemed to be in his early 20 s he took a bottle of loose change out of his briefcase and handed it to the homeless man , who looked at him , obviously amazed everyone who saw the interaction looked stunned i asked the young man why he carried a large bottle of change every day i put the change left over in my pocket in this bottle , he said once a month , i give it to someone who needs it ariel horn on a visit to new york , david wittkowsky of cleveland heights , ohio , joined friends for sunday brunch at madame romaine de lyon in greenwich village at the next table , a young woman and her son , about 4 , were finishing their meal and planning their day now leo , mr wittkowsky and friends overheard her say , do you want to go to the museum and see the mummies , or would you rather take mommy downtown and buy her a new pair of shoes \? laughter i like my laughter close at hand , unsubtle as a big brass band , a serendipity , not planned i like it sudden as surprise , the color of oh , butterflies , heart warm , or cool sometimes , and wise i like my laughter free as air , and rising , layer by lovely layer , as a kind of song , an antic prayer , a hug between two friends , not less than that and finally i confess i like a laugh that s shaped like yes maureen cannon drawings \( phil marden \)
the ash garden by dennis bock 281 pages alfred a knopf 23 the ash garden referred to by the title of dennis bock s harrowing first novel is hiroshima , the city transformed by the atomic bomb into a landscape of death in the early morning hours of aug 6 , 1945 the phrase also refers to the emotional landscape inhabited by mr bock s characters a landscape of loss and exile and regret , a place haunted by the ghosts of time past mr bock , the author of a short story collection titled olympia , explores the fallout of the bomb through the lives of three people , all of them immigrants , displaced persons , brought to america by the vagaries of world war ii there s anton , a physicist who left germany to come to america to work on the bomb , not because of the nazis but because he felt his work and talents would be better appreciated in the united states there s sophie , a halfjewish austrian teenager who ends up in a refugee camp in canada and who sees anton as her ticket to a new life and there s emiko , a 6yearold girl in hiroshima who loses her parents and her brother to the bomb , and who is sent to new york to have her facial injuries repaired by american doctors from these three overlapping lives , mr bock constructs an elegant , unnerving novel that illuminates the personal consequences of the war , transforming characters who might easily have been mere symbols or representative types into keenly observed individuals people indelibly shaped , in anomalous ways , by their losses and their grief they are characters who set off in search of answers and absolution but who find only more questions , and the compromises of ordinary , daily life they are people cut off by the war from their former lives and linked to one another by what they have lost mr bock sometimes tries too hard to underscore those links by using leitmotifs to connect his characters' experiences emiko s facial scars are mirrored by a lupus rash sophie develops on her face , just as the hallucinatory ash garden of hiroshima is mirrored by the dreamlike topiary garden sophie constructs in her backyard still , the reader can easily overlook these writerly excesses , so powerful is the author s channeling of his people s memories writing in quick , elliptical takes , mr bock cuts back and forth among these three characters' lives emiko s story is by far the most traumatic , and the most affecting , for the author makes us experience the bombing of hiroshima through a 6yearold s eyes we watch as she and her 4yearold brother go off to play by the river and glimpse a silver plane cross the sky , trailing a white plume of smoke we watch as a dark object falls from the plane , and the air jumps alive with objects that never had flown before emiko s long convalescence in a ward for radiation victims , the death of her brother in the next hospital bed , her selection as a candidate for special surgery in america , her disorienting voyage to the united states all are limned with emotional precision sophie s long journey to america forms a kind of countermelody to emiko s story she , too , loses her family to the war she , too , finds herself in the new world , unmoored from her past though she is not in love with anton , she marries him , and when she later falls in love with another immigrant who wants her to return to europe to search for their missing families , she reluctantly declines , saying she is determined to move forward with her life her marriage to anton will become a testament to diminished expectations and stubborn commitment , to the simple business of living and the racking up of decades they had reached an implicit understanding that neither believed the other could be blamed for any general failures in their shared life , mr bock writes after everything , they were still together and in the world they had moved through , making such offerings as this somehow seemed enough that was one thing they agreed on , deep in the bones that happiness , pleasure , fulfillment were goals suitable only for the na ve and foolish or extremely lucky they were none of these as for anton , he emerges as the novel s least sympathetic character and the most conflicted he rationalizes the suffering he witnessed in hiroshima which he visited as part of a damageassessment team , weeks after the bombing as being a tragic inevitability but allows his guilt over his own role in developing the bomb to estrange him from his wife at home he believed that she would never grasp the forces behind the events he 'd lived through , and resolved not to let her pity him , or believe that he now regretted the role he had played worse , he allows his own guilty preoccupation to blind him to sophie s losses and pain he did not ask her about her family nothing about what she had lost it was as if that blast had destroyed the ability to see beyond himself initially mr bock s orchestration of the confluence of anton , sophie and emiko s lives might seem contrived anton invites emiko , who is doing a documentary film about hiroshima and the lives it touched , to visit him and sophie in the small canadian town where they now live , and her visit just happens to coincide with a medical emergency in sophie s life but if this scenario reminds the reader that the novelist is there behind the scenery , pulling his characters' strings , it soon metamorphoses into something more mysterious and compelling not only a moving portrait of three lives , damaged and changed by the war , but also a haunting meditation on the uses of memory and its power to both condemn and redeem photo dennis bock \( peter paterson knopf \)
united nations , july 13 seven years ago , gen romeo dallaire had to stand by and watch rwanda destroy itself general dallaire , the commander of united nations peacekeepers , asked for help from the security council and got none hundreds of thousands of ethnic tutsi perished in weeks of butchery , often at the hands of their hutu neighbors the american delegation at the council would not even use the word genocide general dallaire , whose anguish broke him in the years that followed , to the point that he was unable to eat or sleep , returned to the united nations this week recovered and back in canadian government service , he spoke at a conference on controlling the spreading use of small arms he was talking about the need to take guns away from children everywhere , the subject of a canadian report , putting children first but he was still haunted by rwanda in the hundred days of the rwanda genocide , he said at a news conference , over 300 , 000 children were slaughtered the bulk of these children were slaughtered by other children they may have used knives and machetes more often than guns , he added , but in the frenzy of ethnic hatred that prevailed , they were soon running with the pack children kill because they have the instruments to kill , general dallaire said asked what he would have done to prevent the young from joining the massacres , he replied , i would have ripped the guns off them ripping the guns off youngsters is , in a sense , what jos salema is trying to do in the solomon islands like general dallaire , he and several other officials at new united nations programs were in new york to look for ways to curtail trafficking in the kind of guns that most easily fall into young hands there are , by united nations estimates , more than 500 million small arms from pistols and rifles to grenades and small missiles in the world , and about 40 percent of them were illegally acquired in the last decade , wars fueled by such weapons may have killed two million children mr salema , a mozambican who saw his own country consumed by civil war , now sees boys in the solomons , half a world away , tempted into ethnic strife and plain armed banditry when readily available guns combine with hard times with one civil war just over , he said , small boys have seen their armed elders terrorize families and neighborhoods the ethnic conflict has been a bad example to the young , he said they say , 'if our brothers have done this , we will have to do it as well' mr salema is running one of a series of pioneering programs to persuade people of all ages to part with guns , not for money but for jobs or improvements to their communities the projects are different , materially and culturally , from place to place , but all are intended to end gun cultures before a new generation has taken up arms the programs survive on voluntary donations from members of the united nations and on a united nations development program trust fund in the congo republic , maximo halty had disarmed about 6 , 200 former combatants from the latest round of civil war before his projects , based on small loans to start businesses , ran out of money by then , however , he had collected more than 11 , 000 weapons , and 75 percent of the new minibusinesses for which he had provided the startup funds were operating successfully he is back in new york looking for more cash the real measure of these programs , he said in an interview , is less the number of weapons collected than how many excombatants have become stakeholders in peace the first and largest of the gunexchange programs is in albania , where johan p buwalda has been rebuilding public services for towns that have become weaponsfree since 1998 large stashes of guns in albania , which produces arms , were not only creating a gunslinger culture locally but also finding their way to ethnic albanian separatists elsewhere in the balkans when riots after the failure of a national pyramid investment scheme led to the ransacking of government weapons stores , 500 , 000 guns and 200 , 000 tons of ammunition were stolen it was a disaster , mr buwalda said we are talking about an armed civil population that was the reason for the president to ask the un to assist them in solving this problem mr buwalda collected about 163 , 000 weapons by february through our program , people were willing to surrender , to give up these weapons , he said we are happy to say that 80 percent of the stakeholders we have interviewed now feel themselves safe , and confidence has increased between the police and civil society
sydney , australia marion jones , cathy freeman and michael johnson would hardly recognize the scene of their olympic triumphs here last september at stadium australia , the main arena of the sydney games , the track has been ripped up and 30 , 000 of the 110 , 000 seats have been marked for removal the largest olympic stadium ever built is being stripped for new action and struggling to find a future last september , this was the center of world sport , ken edwards , the stadium s chief executive , said now we are just a startup business edwards is immersed in negotiations and renegotiations with sports administrators , seeking longterm bookings in what he says is a very competitive market olympic fame is fine , but it does n't clinch contracts in a city well provided with other sports facilities track and field events are not even on edwards s sales pitch because australia is remote and offseason for the annual pro circuits of major meets and unlike atlanta , where the braves took over the olympic arena after the 1996 games it became turner field sydney has no sports team waiting to move in with the olympic glamour fading , recruiting regular events and crowds to the stadium is a longterm task to test the patience of the investors and lenders who have committed 300 million for a 30year lease of the stadium football , in its four local varieties , and international cricket , with its seamless summer seasons , are the businesses sought by rival stadium owners and managers here , just as football and baseball programs are crucial to arena investors in the united states edwards faces delays and obstacles involving naming rights , tenant teams , football fixtures and persuading more major sport and entertainment events to switch from their usual downtown sites to the olympic precinct 10 miles from sydney s business center with liabilities of 100 million , little cash flow and losses of about 20 million since it opened two years ago , the stadium is currently earning more from tourists 500 a day pay 10 for a onehour visit than from ticket sales earlier , its promoters said they hoped to stage about 40 sports events a year with an average attendance of 40 , 000 the latest financial plan halves that estimate the stadium does not yet have enough major events to pay its way , with fewer than 10 big games scheduled this year for example , the stadium has so far booked only five major rugby games for the junethroughseptember second half of that season the stadium will not be ready until next year to stage australian rules football , the 18aside contest that , with soccer , is the winter sport played most widely in this country because australian rules games require a field about 60 yards by 120 yards , the size and shape of the stadium s playing area , and the number and sight lines of its seats , are being reconfigured at a cost of 35 million by 2003 , there will also be roofing for two open sections , providing 90 percent coverage this complex twoyear makeover is ambitious and optimistic , requiring major commitments by users from rugby internationals to cricket under the lights none of these sports nor the stadium owners are interested in using the vast , highrent space for routine games before small audiences dwarfed by its scale thus the olympic stadium has to find a profitable way to become something new in sport in australia but increasingly common in the united states and europe a bigevent arena that is closed most of the time , except to tourists roaming the bleachers for souvenir photographs
san francisco , may 12 some 40 feet up the firstbase line , todd zeile stood over the motionless baseball and stared at it , as if to say , now what am i going to do with you \? zeile and pitcher jerrod riggan had decided to see if marvin benard s sixthinning chopper would roll foul it did not a run scored of course it is all falling apart for the mets , who seem to have no idea what to do with the baseball they are not hitting it when it matters , and their pitchers are not fooling batters with it they know they are playing badly , but they also feel unlucky with injuries and picked on by umpires they are on pace to lose 99 games the mets lost for the fifth time in a row today when the san francisco giants embarrassed them , 103 , at pacific bell park it is the mets' longest losing streak since september 1999 , when they dropped seven in a row and almost missed qualifying for the playoffs the mets' 1422 start is their worst since 1995 , and it has altered their immediate goals it feels like it s going south , because every time we drop another game under 500 , it s south , zeile said right now , i do n't think anybody s really looking at divisionwinning those things are secondary at this point i think 500 is the benchmark to shoot for , first and foremost the mets have not been at 500 since the fourth game of the season there have been scattered positives , catcher mike piazza said , but they have been buried beneath all the losses , so many of which have been blowouts the mets have already lost nine games by six or more runs we 're just not a very good ball club right now , piazza said manager bobby valentine has spoken to his players several times , telling them to trust one another and not to feel sorry for themselves zeile said valentine s messages have been necessary , but come the next day , there s nobody in here that s not trying who knows \? he said the mets simply might not have the personnel to contend they failed to sign an elite free agent or trade for a prominent player last winter , and their farm system is not deep with prospects ready to play in the majors or who can be used in trades zeile , a 13year veteran , has played for losing teams he felt were short on talent this is not one of those teams , he said the mets have the talent to win , zeile said , and they show they believe that in their reaction to losses there are other teams that figure they 're not expected to win , so they can sort of accept losing and be conscious of their individual statistics , zeile said there s none of that going on around here this team still gets really upset over losses you have a real sense that guys take it to heart the mets have been so bad lately that they are carrying three relievers who pitch almost exclusively in games they lose the mets are 114 when donne wall pitches , 26 in tom martin s games and 06 in riggan s appearances wall walked the leadoff hitter in the 10th inning friday night and was the losing pitcher in a 32 game martin , riggan and wall followed dicky gonzalez \( 11 \) today martin came in to start the fifth , and rich aurilia drilled his second pitch over the leftfield fence martin loaded the bases in the sixth on a walk , a double and another walk , and riggan entered after a strikeout , riggan got benard to bury a ball into the dirt but benard is fast , and he was well up the line before riggan got to the ball riggan let it roll , and so did zeile , but it stopped inside the line the giants increased their lead to 61 , and after a brokenbat infield single scored another run , barry bonds came up with the bases loaded riggan threw his first pitch near the front shoulder of bonds , who stands close to the plate umpire angel hernandez issued a warning , and the mets howled from the bench bonds followed with a tworun double i'm perplexed with all that stuff , valentine said of the warning , not the first issued to a mets pitcher this year but we 've got bigger fish to fry one of the issues is the mets' offensive futility the mets were 1 for 8 with runners in scoring position before the giants took a 91 lead edgardo alfonzo is hitless in his past 10 atbats , and piazza is 4 for 28 since may 6 you feel like you 're letting the team down , piazza , who struck out three times , said it s an empty feeling piazza fanned against russ ortiz \( 61 \) with runners at the corners in the first , and desi relaford was caught stealing on the play in their half of the inning , the giants loaded the bases and capitalized when jeff kent smashed a ball down the leftfield line benny agbayani slowed down , and it seemed as if he thought the ball would go over the fence for a grand slam it hit the wall instead for a double but agbayani had not misjudged it he strained a lower abdominal muscle while chasing it and left the game in the third inning so it goes for the mets , who are unhealthy , unlucky , unhappy and , for a defending pennantwinner , almost unthinkably bad inside pitch benny agbayani may have strained an abdominal muscle in the field , but he felt the injury most while avoiding a high fastball from the giants' russ ortiz in the second inning agbayani said he had never had an abdominal injury and did not know if he could play sunday , but he said going on the disabled list was not a possibility photo left fielder tsuyoshi shinjo chasing a ball hit by barry bonds in the third inning that went for a double \( associated press \)
when a company loses its visionary founder , people on wall street usually start asking questions the death earlier this month of ely callaway , the entrepreneur who began a third career in 1982 when he bought a little company called hickory stick and turned it into callaway golf , was one of those moments anytime a company s founder and one as integral to the company s success passes away , the kneejerk reaction is that management will explore alternatives , including selling the business , said joe yerman , a leisuretime analyst at bear stearns callaway golf had sales of nearly 900 million last year its irons and drivers , popular with golfers at every skill level , are market leaders in their categories the clubs are held in high regard by the world s best players as well roughly half of the 156 contestants who started the british open on thursday used callaway irons or woods some are using the callaway erc ii , a hightechnology driver that has been banned in this country by the united states golf association the 3 billion golf market is growing at only 1 to 2 percent a year , but the company has nearly 100 million in cash and no debt they have a very strong balance sheet and are in a position to create earnings growth at a time when there is not earnings growth , mr yerman said callaway stock , pounded in june after the company issued a warning that secondquarter earnings would fall short of expectations , began to move higher in the final days of mr callaway s illness , amid rising speculation that the company might be sold , and it moved higher again on july 5 , the day the 82yearold mr callaway died but the stock has dropped , closing on friday at 1560 a share , well off its 52week high of 2701 it has stabilized in recent days as it has become clear that mr callaway had done some thinking about the company s future to begin with , he did not own that much stock at the time of his death about one million of callaway s 7677 million outstanding shares a much larger position could have been disruptive if his heirs three children survive him ever wanted to sell the company although he did not step down as president and chief executive until april , when his pancreatic cancer was discovered , mr callaway had put a senior management team in place over the last two years the heart and soul of this company did not die with the man , said timothy a conder , an analyst at a g edwards then there is the issue of who , exactly , might actually buy callaway its three major competitors are fortune brands , which owns titleist and cobra golf adidas , which owns taylor made and nike , whose golf balls are played by a gent named tiger woods none of these are ideal acquirers , according to analysts fortune brands , which also makes liquor and home products , could probably afford callaway but in the late 1990 s the company paid 600 million for cobra golf and has written off nearly all of its investment i would venture to say the cobra franchise is worth less than 10 million today , said bud leedom , an analyst at wells fargo van kasper in san diego similarly , adidas does not seem a likely buyer either , if only because it is already fully occupied with its golf subsidiary , taylor made some years ago , there were rumors that nike was interested in callaway but nike is developing its own golf club line , mr leedom said , adding that buying callaway would be a waste of money for a brand of nike s strength the brand identity callaway has would be destroyed by putting the nike swoosh on it , he said those guys are clearly out all of the likely candidates are n't even close callaway is scheduled to release its earnings report on wednesday , and mr conder said he would not be shocked if the company announced that it was buying back more stock , including shares from mr callaway s estate he gave some stock to foundations a few years ago and sold some to the company , mr conder said i would not be surprised to see that happen again graph shows daily stock prices of callaway golf for the year \( source bloomberg \)

for a person with a pacemaker , the odds that the device s manufacturer will recall it or issue a safety alert over a oneyear period are about 1 in 15 , a new study has calculated for more sophisticated devices known as implantable cardioverter defibrillators , or icd s , that can detect abnormal heartbeats and deliver a strong electric shock to avert sudden death , the odds are even higher nearly one in six however , representatives of the manufacturers said that only a fraction of the recalled devices were actually defective , and that the devices' benefits far outweighed their risks the study , by researchers at brigham and women s hospital in boston , involved weekly enforcement reports that the food and drug administration issued from january 1990 to december 2000 over the 11 years , 42 recalls and 10 less serious safety alerts were issued for pacemakers and icd s involving more than 520 , 000 devices based on estimates of how many people have the devices , the researchers calculated the likelihood that a person would be affected by a recall or safety alert the rate of advisories has increased since 1995 , they said they report their findings in today s issue of the journal of the american medical association about 600 , 000 americans have pacemakers , and 150 , 000 , including vice president dick cheney , have the implanted devices mr cheney s was implanted in june the study also calculated that if doctors and patients followed the recalls' recommendations , more than 36 , 000 devices were replaced the study estimated that the total cost of the extra visits to doctors to check on the devices and the replacement of the defective ones to be 870 million i was surprised by the high number of devices affected by the advisories , said dr william h maisel , a cardiologist at brigham and women s hospital and the lead author of the article only a few deaths have been attributed to malfunctions of a pacemaker or an icd dr marshall s stanton , medical director at the cardiac rhythm management division of medtronic inc , the leading manufacturer of pacemakers and icd s , called the recall numbers misleading for instance , dr stanton said , medtronic issued a recall in 1999 covering 10 , 000 defibrillators in which the device could short circuit while delivering an electrical shock to the heart the company estimated that even if the defect had remained unfixed , only 12 of the 10 , 000 patients would be affected the devices were fixed by transmitting new computer instructions to them in a procedure that did not require surgery none of these people needed to have their devices replaced , dr stanton said he said he believed the number of advisories was rising because the manufacturers and the drug agency are now more vigilant and because the devices now send out much more information about their own performance , pinpointing problems that would previously have gone unnoticed dr maisel agreed that patients with pacemakers or defibrillators should not panic but he added , i think it would be reasonable for the fda to review their current process and increasing their oversight before approving a new product for sale in an editorial accompanying the article , dr kim a eagle of the university of michigan medical center suggested that perhaps new devices should be tested longer before receiving approval technological advances have given the devices , especially icds , more powerful capabilities over the past decade but the push to quickly approve the products might miss some of the glitches that is really the tradeoff that we face , dr eagle said i think this article is very important in helping all of us step back and say , 'are we happy with the system that we have \?

the jets , who hope to build a stateoftheart stadium on the west side of manhattan , are considering practicing this summer at a slightly less posh locale rikers island general manager terry bradway says he is thinking about having the jets hold a trainingcamp practice on the jail grounds and why \? to recapture a part of their peripatetic history the jets practiced occasionally at rikers when they played at shea stadium beginning in 1964 bradway said they also practiced at rikers during the 1968 season , which culminated with the greatest moment in jets history , the super bowl iii victory the jets got their own practice complex at hofstra in 1974 but before that , the jets were not allowed to practice at shea during baseball season out of concern they would ruin the field for baseball and were forced to board buses and practice wherever they could find an open field among other places , the jets practiced at the world s fair grounds , randalls island and , after working out a deal with the warden , the prisoners' fields at rikers the prisoners watched practice and hooted and howled , said the longtime team spokesman , frank ramos , who remembers the practices we did n't have any problems with it bradway said the idea was very preliminary and he had yet to speak to anyone at rikers about it among the greatest concerns would be the condition of the fields we would not risk injury , he said i would have to make sure the field was ok so somebody would n't get hurt security would be another issue when the jets last practiced at rikers , there were no individual practice sessions for players , because all team buses had to arrive and leave the grounds at the same time and that was before the days when teams had their own elaborate security measures , as the jets do now but bradway is committed to breaking up the monotony of training camp the jets will practice aug 3 at hofstra s football stadium , across hempstead turnpike from the jets' regular training field the jets believe players feel more excitement under the lights bradway has also thought about staging a field goal kicking contest with the new york power of the women s united soccer association , something the kansas city chiefs bradway s former employer did with mia hamm and others presumably , none of rikers s regular residents would be invited to participate in practice all we need is burt reynolds out there , bradway said like in 'the longest yard'
east rutherford , nj feb 21 the pair of 24yearold allstars , already the future of the game , drew up the ending of this one just as their gripping duel was beginning we said it was going to come down to me and him , the nets' stephon marbury recalled he and toronto s vince carter had agreed on that , all the way back in the first quarter fastforward to the fourth quarter , when marbury was scoring 14 of his teamhigh 35 points , including 10 in a row carter was scoring 10 of his gamehigh 39 points , including a 21footer to tie the game at 104104 with 2 minutes 51 seconds to play both were brilliant in the remaining few minutes , but marbury did not have to do it alone he had help from the hotshooting keith van horn , whom carter forgot to include in his plans new jersey s pair provided the onetwo punch that propelled the nets over their own mistakes and the highflying carter tonight for a 113111 triumph we won , that s the most important thing , said marbury , who finished with a seasonhigh 14 assists van horn , who scored 28 points , broke out of his shooting malaise to hit a careerhigh five 3pointers , as the nets sank a franchisetying 13 3pointers but it was van horn s clutch turnaround runner in the lane with 1 07 to play that gave the nets a 110106 lead , and helped lift them past a dangerous visiting team the way vince was going tonight , i knew anything could happen , van horn said he made some incredible shots , even with guys in his face i knew we just had to battle and keep fighting marbury hit two free throws that gave the nets a 112108 lead with 124 seconds to play carter followed with a twohanded slam the nets uttered a collective gasp when carter deflected kenyon martin s inbounds pass , intended for lucious harris , with 10 seconds left lucious was wide open , but he got his hand on it , martin said of carter the nets thought the scene might be a nightmarish repeat of boston s milt palacio s gamewinning 3pointer at the buzzer on dec 28 with this team , you have to think that , harris said we 've been snakebitten so many times in fact , carter seemed to have tied the score at 112112 with a basket from the key with 33 seconds left but the officials waved it off , saying he had been fouled by martin before the shot he never put the ball back down after he was fouled , raptors coach lenny wilkens said how could it have not been called \? carter , a 79 percent freethrow shooter , still could have tied the score , but he missed the first of two free throws the nets completed an inbounds pass to van horn , who was promptly fouled he hit the second of two free throws to preserve the victory with 22 seconds left after toronto s mark jackson missed a 3point desperation shot at the buzzer , marbury raised his hands van horn sighed in relief the nets had won their second straight game and improved their record to 1937 we almost let it get away , but we kept our composure and continued to play , nets coach byron scott said this was the first game the nets had played against carter and the raptors this season playing against vince is always spectacular because he brings so much creativity to the game , marbury said everyone wants to see what he does i want to beat him and it s always great when we beat a team like toronto marbury admitted that the game was not stylish i'm not going to kid myself , he said none of the teams played defense until the end offensively , marbury was again the anchor for the nets after hitting a 3pointer , he drove the lane with 9 12 left , forcing carter to commit his fifth foul , and converted both free throws he then intercepted charles oakley s inbounds pass on the far corner baseline and sank a 3pointer to catapult the nets to a 13point lead , 9986 , for their largest advantage of the night martin , who guarded carter for most of the game , added two jumpers in the final minute but van horn was the most visible complement to marbury , making 10 of 16 shots i was in a good rhythm with my shot all night , van horn said rebounds rod thorn , the nets' team president , said through a team spokesman that there is nothing new and nothing on the horizon as thursday s trade deadline approaches photo after a 3pointer , stephon marbury , center , was hugged by kenyon martin as lenny wilkens looked away \( barton silverman the new york times \)
should all children have access to training intended to lead to a career in the highly competitive art of ballet \? should ballet schools be allowed to select the children they believe are most promising \? those questions have been raised , to considerable furor , by krissy keefer , a modern dancer , choreographer and teacher whose daughter was not chosen in an audition this summer for a preprofessional beginners' program at the san francisco ballet school ms keefer filed a discrimination complaint against the school with the san francisco human rights commission in november ms keefer contends that her daughter , fredrika , was denied admission to the school s level one classes because she has what ms keefer described as a short , athletic body dance company directors choose dancers as carefully as they choose repertory , and many ballet directors today prefer long , lean bodies schools often look at children s bone structure and flexibility in auditions to predict what bodies will look like and how they will move by the time the children reach their midteens criteria for beginners' entry into the san francisco ballet school are published in the school s brochure and audition announcements , according to the response the school filed on dec 6 with the human rights commission , as well as on the school s web site and in its contracts for city financing they include a wellproportioned body , a straight and supple spine , legs turned out from the hip joint and correctly arched feet all beginners are accepted on a trial basis , the brochure specifications say because of an ordinance adopted by san francisco last year that denies city money to organizations that discriminate on the basis of body type , ms keefer said she has a case against the company and its school , which both receive city support that is the only legal grounds i have , ms keefer said without that , i would just be a disgruntled mother fredrika , then 8 , was one of 61 children who auditioned in june she and 17 others were not accepted fredrika had studied ballet for a year under the company s dance in schools program , which provides free training to public school children at their schools a few days before the audition she was offered a oneyear scholarship to take classes at the company school , though not in the more advanced level one program ms keefer turned it down ms keefer said that when she called to register her daughter for the level one audition , she was told that school officials wanted to speak with her first but no one called , she said , and when she arrived for the audition an administrator suggested that fredrika should not bother taking the audition because she would not be chosen and it would be awkward for the child i asked if it was because she did n't have the right body , ms keefer said i was told 'yes , they wo n't even look at her' fredrika is short for her age she s got an athletic little body , more muscular than lean , ms keefer said but she s really good fredrika began ballet studies at age 5 what i object to is the audition itself , which was just skipping and walking , ms keefer said they did not look for technique in the response to the complaint , the school denied that ms keefer was told that children were accepted on the basis of weight and height or that no one would look at fredrika in the audition the audition was conducted by a group of teachers at the school , none of whom spoke to ms keefer a child s height and weight may be taken into consideration at auditions , but they alone do not determine admission to beginner programs , according to the school s response to ms keefer s complaint , which described fredrika s measurements 49 inches tall and 64 pounds as within the range of girls admitted to level one in june the response also said that previous studies and technical skills are not considered significant because the school is concerned with training youngsters in the style and technique of the san francisco ballet ms keefer said she was not disputing that companies had the right to choose a body type but i feel like a school in an area like san francisco should have a breadth in their programs , that they should accept all kinds of children in all kinds of areas , ms keefer said i would like to change the process i audition , you look at my resume , my technique , my expressiveness , my musicality , lots of different things beside body type class adjourned dancers and their friends partied hard at the 550 broadway dance studio on dec 28 the next morning everything was moved out the studio was closing after six years of rehearsals , performances and classes in ballet , modern dance and martial arts attended by thousands of dancers the lease was up the rent was to soar to 11 , 200 a month from 3 , 750 with its closing a colorful 30year history of dance companies and schools comes to an end the studio was opened by the choreographer daniel nagrin in 1971 and occupied for a time by paul taylor and his company the legend is that the floors were so hard that they finished his career as a dancer , zvi gotheiner , a choreographer and the studio s manager , said recently so we built new floors mr gotheiner s idea , he said , was mainly to offer lowcost rehearsal and teaching space an average of 10 teachers taught some 2 , 500 students a year at the studio we managed to keep it more or less breaking even , mr gotheiner said it was a lot of work but a lot of fun it was a special place mr gotheiner s 11yearold dance company will revert to its former gypsy travels , moving from one studio to another to rehearse for a march season produced by the 92nd street y harkness dance center at the duke , a blackbox theater in the new 42nd street studios one of the city s most admired teachers , mr gotheiner will start teaching ballet in a space at city center the whole package has fallen apart , he said that s my biggest sorrow i tried to get together with other organizations to open a dance studio i do n't have money myself but it came to zero the real estate market is so high now that it s risky and people get nervous but i 'll keep working on it the city has been steadily losing dance schools and studios in recent years i feel this is a sign of the times for dancers in new york , mr gotheiner said and dance is an art form that needs an infrastructure you ca n't just sit down at your desk and write he hesitated to make the closing public this is a story you keep hearing , he said we artists take it personally as a sign of being unappreciated or further marginalized i do n't know if that is the case we 're young and great and strong and we readjust and find a way to do what we have to do , he said but it s harder now things are changing , and that is changing the face of the new york experience for young people who come here

the farm stand at the edge of fairview farms in bridgehampton that opened last thursday was built from the chassis of an old potato truck it is a relic after all , the fields where harry and art ludlow grew 2 , 200 tons of potatoes last year lie fallow this spring fourteen other trucks and a potato planter and a potato cutter are up for sale weeds are sprouting through the bare expanse of soil that runs from their mecox road farmhouses all the way down to mecox bay and the remnants of last season s crop are piled high in the manure spreader , waiting to be dropped on the fields and left to rot after four generations of tilling the island s signature crop , the ludlows are out of the potato business make me an offer i ca n't refuse , said harry ludlow , showing a visitor the barn that not long ago was stuffed ceiling to floor with potatoes and now looks like a showroom for used farm equipment package deal we 'll consider any offer one year ago , the ludlows were using the grain drills , heavy tillage , spreaders and plows , cultivating and planting the potatoes the island has long been famous for on 100 of their own acres and another 100 of rented land the specialized potato equipment was kept in good repair and working fine neither brother remembers who said it first but in january , they decided to call it quits spring arrived and the spuds were n't planted instead , art ludlow , 49 , and his wife , stacy , 45 , are concentrating on livestock harry ludlow , 51 , and his wife , barbara , 45 , have high hopes for the farm stand , planning to stock it with the wide array of vegetables , sweet corn and flowers they started in the small greenhouse on the back of their farmhouse and have started to plant on a fraction of their 50 acres it was pretty much a nobrainer when we analyzed the farm honestly and truthfully , said harry ludlow , walking carefully through his newly planted vegetable patch we ca n't grow in size , so how do we grow in potatoes \? we could n't find any other way to grow in potatoes , so we changed sold on the commercial market , potatoes have a low profit margin ample acreage is vital competition from other states and canada is fierce , and available land on the east end is dwindling and each year for the past five years , the ludlows have lost pieces of the extra 100 acres they rented they were turned into housing subdivisions potatoes were profitable every year except one in the nearly 30 years since the brothers joined their father on the farm last year was one of the top three ever but looking to the future and the possibilities for the next generation of ludlow farmers , harry s son and daughter and art s two sons convinced the brothers to change direction the difference is , after losing land in the past we have always been able to pick up other land but now we are not , harry ludlow said there is land here but it s not rentable we just ca n't compete not with the horse farms , the vineyards and the acreage being bought for personal pleasure , harry ludlow continued , citing a 30acre parcel that was recently planted with grass seed and turned into a swell backyard not with the traffic that is difficult to move heavy equipment through not with the neighbors living in oversize summer homes that dot the perimeter of their fields and are sensitive to the noise and dust and smells of farming so the ludlows , who were among the 30 potato farmers left on the east end , decided that spuds were history phasing it out would give us all the negative aspects of the business and none of the positive , harry ludlow said it takes the same amount to clean up the potato planter whether we plant one acre or 500 acres the economics are n't there at one time , 70 , 000 acres of long island were devoted to round , white potatoes about 5 , 000 acres remain the question was when and better sooner than later , while we have physical health and financial health , while we have momentum , let s just do it , harry ludlow said we are way outside our comfort zone but that s going to happen anyway , so let s get it done now the ludlows' decision is a casualty for the east end potato business but it made their wives happy it s laborintensive and timeconsuming and with the kids getting older , there were n't enough hours in the day , stacy ludlow said we could n't go anywhere , we could n't do anything it was always the potatoes , the potatoes , the potatoes instead , art ludlow , who should have had lots more time on his hands lately , is having trouble finding enough hours to cut the grass and fix all the things he ignored while farming potatoes he is helping his wife with the 14stall horse boarding facility , mecox bay farm , which he built her on eight acres of land around the corner three years ago , long before getting out of potatoes was even a thought and starting in july , as he has done each year since high school , he will raise 250 turkeys in an outdoor pen behind the old potato barn , then slaughter and package them right out his back door for thanksgiving he is also planning to buy a cow , with hopes of making cheese
bangalore , india , march 15 with frosted glass and funky amber lights playing off the turquoise walls , the offices of customer asset look more like a santa fe diner than a telephone call center in southern india the cultural vertigo is complete when employees introduce themselves to a visitor hi , my name is susan sanders , and i'm from chicago , said c r suman , 22 , who is in fact a native of bangalore and fields calls from customers of a telecommunications company in the united states ms suman s fluent english and broad vowels would pass muster in the stands at wrigley field in case her callers ask personal questions , ms suman has conjured up a fictional american life , with parents bob and ann , brother mark and a madeup business degree from the university of illinois we watch a lot of 'friends' and 'ally mcbeal' to learn the right phrases , ms suman said when people talk about their bimmer , you have to know they mean a bmw or when they say 'no way , jos , ' there is no jos , added ms suman s coworker , nishara anthony , who goes by the name naomi morrison and , if asked , says she comes from perth amboy , nj the point of this pretense is to convince americans who dial tollfree numbers that the person on the other end of the line works right nearby not 8 , 300 miles away , in a country where staticfree calls used to be a novelty call centers are a booming business in india , as companies like general electric and british airways set up supermarketsize phone banks to handle a daily barrage of customer inquiries the companies value india for its widespread use of english and lowcost labor but call centers are only the low end of a much larger industry of indian software developers , transcribers , accountants , web site designers and animation artists who work on projects for foreign companies from indian offices by 2008 , such assignments will generate 800 , 000 new jobs and 17 billion in revenue for india , according to the consultants mckinsey company india is on its way to being the back office for the world , said shriram ramdas , one of the founders of bangalore labs , which manages web sites and other information networks for companies from a futuristic office in the international tech park on the outskirts of bangalore doing backoffice chores for advanced economies may not sound glamorous , especially for a nation that has created an 8 billion computer software industry virtually from scratch in the last decade but it could spread the wealth of india s technology revolution beyond the pockets of prosperity that exist today in bangalore , hyderabad and a few other hubs of high technology right now , when you come to our campus , you 're leaving india behind , said n r narayana murthy , the chairman of infosys technologies , one of india s most successful software companies and the first to be listed on nasdaq we 're living in a makebelieve world with its putting green , aerobics studio , basketball court and even a deer park , the infosys headquarters is a powerful symbol of what technology has brought to india since the late 1980 s companies like infosys and the rival wipro ltd are deeply embedded in the microchips of dozens of the largest american businesses unlike taiwan or south korea , which became known as lowcost producers of computer hardware , india made its name as an unparalleled customer service agent while their american clients sleep , software writers churn out code , which is then beamed by satellite to the united states these services became so valuable that the founders of infosys and wipro were able to take their companies public at dotcomlike valuations mr murthy became a billionaire , and stock options showered unheardof riches on even lowlevel employees the man who serves tea to mr murthy recently cashed in his options to buy a 100 , 000 house his driver bought his own car about 28 million people work in india s technology industry , even with a steady exodus of top software developers to silicon valley or suburban boston yet the industry , despite its breakneck growth , still accounts for only 2 percent of india s total economic output of 450 billion for all the talk about the indian technology revolution , the technology industry has made only a glancing impression on the physical landscape of the country bangalore is ringed by technology parks that could be in palo alto or austin but the city itself is a mess , with potholed roads , crumbling buildings and a ramshackle , overburdened airport with no international flights for technology to make a dent in the pervasive poverty of this country , mr murthy contends , it must account for 10 percent of india s gross domestic product at current growth rates , india will have a 900 billion economy in 2010 technology would then have to be a 90 billion industry we need to broaden the base of technology in india , mr murthy said this new business will be very valuable as a way to generate jobs for people who are not as skilled as software programmers although backoffice work is not particularly challenging for a company like infosys , mr murthy said he would consider expanding into it , if only to create thousands of more jobs in bangalore jobs in call centers are coveted here while the salaries are hardly lucrative by technology industry standards anywhere from 1 , 600 to 2 , 100 a year they beat those for most clerical positions
in barking sharks , the playwright israel horovitz offers stark proof of how quickly time can wreak its cruel damage unfortunately for him , the message is entirely unintentional mr horovitz wrote barking sharks , which is now getting its new york premiere at the t schreiber studio , back in the mid1990 s , before monicagate , before the perfect storm , before american beauty now , of course , thinking people everywhere agree that there is absolutely no more insight or pathos to be wrung from the male midlife crisis or the doomed fishing trip mr horovitz , alas , sought to tap both wells in barking sharks , and as a result , in 2001 the play could n't possibly feel more unnecessary time , though , need not shoulder all the blame this drama was undoubtedly a pale piece of work even back in 1995 , when it received its world premiere at mr horovitz s gloucester stage company in massachusetts the play \( set in gloucester , as are many of mr horovitz s works \) tells of eddie ciolino \( bob rogerson \) , a middleaged fellow who left gloucester when he was a teenager and now , many fat new york paychecks later , develops a hankering to return and become a fisherman his wife and son would just as soon he remained an overpaid advertising executive , but eddie will have none of it he is , it seems , fixated on a particular moment in his youth , when he and two friends had a band called the barking sharks the term band is a generous one the play opens with a flashback scene in which the sharks sing neil young s down by the river , and , frankly , they sound like whining cats in any case , eddie drags his family with him to gloucester and runs into the other two sharks , sara \( mary beth kowalskitwisdale \) , who was his girlfriend in the old days , and ted \( jerry rago \) , who was his best buddy ted and sara are now married , ted is a fisherman , the weather s turning ugly , and well , you can pretty much guess the rest which is the problem the play is wincingly obvious from start to finish the affair , the trial at sea , the adolescent romance between eddie s son and sara and ted s daughter it s also full of thudding dialogue , like the line eddie utters as he foolishly heads out into a storm to try to rescue ted i know that if i die doing this , he says grimly , i will have died a man whatever just hurry up and die there is not a single character here who can be anything other than selfabsorbed for more than a few moments , which means there is not a single character the audience can invest in emotionally especially since we 've heard it all before , and very recently , at the movies or in the endless handwringing brought on by one particularly highlevel midlife crisis heck , mr rogerson even looks like bill clinton the actors , burdened with trite material , uniformly fail to impress , though it s not for lack of stage time mr horovitz , a veteran playwright who should know better , is here afflicted with does n'tknowwhentostop disease long after the play should have ended , characters are plunging into speeches that begin , when i was 4 terry schreiber compounds the problem by directing at a glacial pace , and as a result the play flirts with the threehour mark a long three hours it is it s like watching the tide go out , only more predictable barking sharks by israel horovitz directed by terry schreiber lighting by joe saint sets by john pollard costumes by david toser sound designer and musical director , gib von bach fight choreographer , randy kurstin technical director , jason starr stage manager , sarah b zimmerman presented by t schreiber studio at the maddox theater , 151 west 26th street , chelsea with dennis anderson \( young ted and mac asaro \) , alexandra westmore \( young sara and annie asaro \) , rob dodd \( little eddie \) , bob rogerson \( eddie ciolino \) , j m mcdonough \( ralph burke and busty ciolino \) , quinn lemley \( alice ciolino \) , jerry rago \( ted asaro \) , mary beth kowalskitwisdale \( sara asaro \) and jason starr and gib von bach \( musicians \)
earl washington jr was both braindamaged and mentally retarded he grew up in a harddrinking , violent family in rural virginia in the 1960 s and 70 s he performed dismally in school and dropped out when he was 15 on a good day , his iq could be measured in the high 60 s on at least one occasion , his score was 57 reciting the alphabet was too tough for him but earl washington liked to please so when he found himself in police custody in 1983 he began telling the cops whatever they wanted to hear he waived his miranda rights and confessed to all sorts of crimes , including burglary , rape and murder his performance was farcical he knew nothing about a string of crimes he confessed to , and when eyewitnesses were contacted , they basically rolled their eyes and told the police they had the wrong guy but prosecutors went ahead and pinned an awful crime on earl washington anyway they charged him with the rape and murder of a young woman named rebecca williams the everhelpful mr washington readily confessed to that crime , too there were some problems mr washington said the victim was black she was white he said she was short she was tall he said he had kicked in the door to her residence the door had not been damaged he said he stabbed her two or three times she had been stabbed 38 times none of these outlandish discrepancies deterred the authorities the only evidence they had was mr washington s absurd confession , but that was enough to bring a capital case against him at the end of a threeday trial he was convicted and sentenced to death most americans do not believe the criminal justice system functions this ludicrously but it does frequently in 1985 mr washington came within nine days of being executed his lawyers , working frantically , managed to secure a stay meanwhile the use of dna testing was evolving , and early tests seemed to offer concrete evidence of mr washington s innocence on the basis of that evidence , his death sentence was reduced in 1994 to life in prison last year more sophisticated dna tests were conducted and they showed conclusively that earl washington , despite his confession , had not attacked rebecca williams mr washington was pardoned by gov james s gilmore iii and was freed from prison in february the death penalty is always problematic i am opposed to it in all cases but if it is used , it should be reserved for the most blameworthy perpetrators of the most heinous acts even when mentally retarded defendants are clearly guilty , it is extremely difficult to determine their level of culpability a recent report by human rights watch , titled mental retardation and the death penalty , mentioned the case of a retarded man convicted of raping and murdering an elderly woman when asked at his trial to explain why rape was wrong , the defendant struggled to find an answer , finally blurting out , maybe it s against her religion executing such an individual is not the same as executing timothy mcveigh beyond that , as the report notes , there is wide acknowledgment among mental health experts that the mentally retarded s characteristic suggestibility and willingness to please leads them to confess to crimes they may not have committed , including murder it is also difficult , often impossible , for retarded individuals to assist in their own defense their memories are often unreliable and they have trouble grasping abstract concepts all of this was lost on the governor of texas , a man named rick perry the texas legislature , in an uncharacteristically progressive move , passed a law banning the execution of the retarded but governor perry vetoed it on sunday , saying there was no need for the law it would have been a big deal if texas the undisputed champion when it comes to executions in the united states had decided it was morally unacceptable to execute retarded individuals but governor perry shrank from that challenge the united states will someday ban the execution of the retarded , and probably in the long term all other individuals as well governor perry could have given us a big push in that direction , but chose not to
this time of year , americans by the thousands will enjoy a yearly , nearreligious ritual they will switch on their television sets and watch it s a wonderful life produced and directed by frank capra and first released in late december 1946 , it s a wonderful life has been called a timeless masterpiece and a national treasure by fans , historians and diverse publications it is the subject of film journal articles and of a glossy , adoring coffeetable book its star , james stewart , often said it was his favorite film and when its blackandwhite images were colorized in the mid80 s , he appeared before a congressional committee to denounce the change but the warmth people now feel for the movie was not shared by its screenwriters , frances goodrich and albert hackett the idea for it s a wonderful life was born in february 1938 , when philip van doren stern , a historian and novelist , drafted a short story about a smalltown banker who thinks about suicide and is rescued by his guardian angel , who miraculously shows him the difference he has made in the lives of his family and neighbors stern titled the draft the greatest gift it was rejected by several magazines but in 1943 , stern printed 200 copies and sent them out as christmas greetings one went to his agent , who sold the story to rko three distinguished writers dalton trumbo , clifford odets and marc connelly wrote screenplays based on the story , but none were satisfactory to the studio in september 1945 , capra bought the story and the various adaptations for his newly formed production company , liberty films , and hired the hacketts the hacketts were my aunt and uncle married in 1931 , when he was 30 and she was 40 , they had by 1945 built a solid reputation writing scripts for pictures , including the thin man and two of its sequels as well as naughty marietta , rose marie and ah , wilderness ! previously , they had acted on broadway \( he was the more successful , having appeared opposite the vaudeville star eddie cantor in the ziegfeld musical hit whoopee \) they had also helped to found the screen writers guild \( later renamed the writers guild when television and radio writers joined \) in many ways , frances and albert , who had no children of their own , were the ideal aunt and uncle warm , generous , always interested in even the most childish goingson my own daughter got to watch the thanksgiving day parade from their west side apartment , and they had a list of people who were on the receiving end of monthly or yearly infusions of cash in their writing collaboration , she was the organizer , the one who shouted at producers \( in ladylike tones \) he was the main creator of sparkling dialogue being with them could be thrilling they were known for their wit , their sophistication and the delights of their bel air dinner parties and they counted james cagney , f scott fitzgerald , lillian hellman and s j perelman among their friends another friend , ogden nash , described them in a couplet everybody in hollywood is just codfish and halibut compared to frances and albert in hiring the hacketts , capra knew what he was getting in his autobiography , he called them perceptive , human writers the hacketts , in turn , knew what they were getting or thought they did frank capra was undoubtedly a great filmmaker and a man of truly impressive accomplishments , as many screenwriters acknowledged i 'd rather be capra than god , garson kanin had once said , if there is a capra in 1935 , in a letter to their agent , frances had gushed any writer would give his soul to work for him he s so creative at first , the hacketts and capra got along smoothly then the writers learned that capra and jo swirling , a highly successful screenwriter , were rewriting their pages jo swirling was a very close friend of ours , and when we heard that he was working behind us which was supposed to be against the rules of the screen writers guild it was a very unpleasant feeling , albert said in an interview he gave on the subject relations worsened when , at a meeting , capra called frances my dear woman frank capra could be condescending , albert told the journalist , and you just did n't address frances as 'my dear woman' when we were pretty far along in the script but not done , our agent called and said , 'capra wants to know how soon you 'll be finished' frances said , 'we 're finished right now' we put our pens down and never went back to it in later years , describing capra s behavior , both frances and albert used language unprintable in a family newspaper when they handed in their version , capra quickly began making changes later , at a party while the film was being shot , the hacketts heard an anecdote from beulah bondi , who was playing stewart s mother frances recalled it in another interview she said , 'the most miraculous thing happened there is this scene which is just words , words , words , and it could n't play so capra shut down for the day and told us to come back the next morning he came in the next morning with a simple , lovely scene , and it worked' the point is , the scene that would n't work had been capra s , and the simple scene was the one we had done originally capra brought in two other writers , michael wilson and the hacketts' friend dorothy parker , to polish the script all of this created contention after arbitration by the screen writers guild , capra was given thirdposition writing credit , after the hacketts , and swirling got credit for additional scenes people viewing it s a wonderful life in the coming weeks will probably not know the names frances goodrich and albert hackett \( she died in 1984 , and he survived her until 1995 \) but after it s a wonderful life , they went on to write the screenplays for 14 more movies , including easter parade , father of the bride \( and its sequel \) and seven brides for seven brothers their proudest achievement was their 1955 play the diary of anne frank , which won the pulitzer prize for drama but for frank capra , it s a wonderful life was never to be surpassed he directed only three more features , and when he died at 94 in 1991 , he 'd been out of the business for 25 years joseph mcbride , the author of the 1992 biography frank capra the catastrophe of success , attributes capra s creative decline in part to his interference with screenwriters his need to be recognized as a writer himself would make it increasingly difficult for him to work with firstrate writers , finally throwing him back on his own limited resources , mr mcbride wrote the hacketts were so bitter after working with capra that for many years they said they had made a point of never seeing it s a wonderful life but they later admitted that like millions of others , they had finally seen it on television photos james stewart , above left , in it s a wonderful life frances goodrich and albert hackett , right , wrote a script for the film \( rko radio

unless adm thomas fargo decides otherwise , the navy s investigation into the collision of an american submarine with a japanese vessel near honolulu in february is likely to end on a premature and unsatisfactory note a report by elaine sciolino in sunday s times quoted senior pentagon officials as saying that the public court of inquiry into the incident had recommended that the submarine s skipper , cmdr scott waddle , not be tried by a courtmartial instead the commander would receive some lesser punishment , like a reprimand , that would effectively end his career but spare him the military equivalent of a criminal trial the final decision rests with admiral fargo the officials cited in the times report said that he was unlikely to act against the panel s recommendations nevertheless , we urge him to consider a courtmartial we have no wish to prejudge the outcome a courtmartial affords defendants a chance to explain their behavior and to present mitigating evidence in this instance , a courtmartial is also justified by the nature of the case nine people were killed in the accident , which triggered widespread resentment in japan that could well flare up again according to testimony presented to the court of inquiry , the operations of the submarine , the greeneville , were riddled with mistakes and violations of safety rules commander waddle himself testified that he had cut short or omitted several safety precautions , failed to reassign duties to compensate for the absence of a third of his normal crew and rushed the periscope search conducted just before the surfacing drill that caused the accident the testimony also identified serious mistakes by a petty officer who failed to notify the commander that the greeneville was dangerously close to the japanese ship the testimony indicated that the only reason the ship went to sea that day was to entertain 16 civilian guests as part of a navy program aimed at cultivating public good will one of the shortcomings of the navy s public court of inquiry was that none of these civilians were summoned to testify , though they could have been the civilians might well be asked to appear in any courtmartial , and their testimony in turn could discredit the civilian visitor program three of the civilians were seated at controls on the submarine at the time of the collision this has not been an easy time for the navy , and it has been a grievously difficult time for commander waddle but the fundamental issue here is accountability the commander s , his crew s and the navy s a truncated inquiry cannot inspire the public confidence that would come with a full courtmartial proceeding

beit rima , west bank , oct 25 as israeli forces slipped into this village under cover of darkness early wednesday , some palestinian defenders were sleeping on cots under the olive trees they were not expecting a major attack , people here said today , but many west bank towns these days are on alert for incursions palestinian security headquarters have become favorite israeli targets , so the open air has become more appealing what began with a few shots that one resident thought might be a wedding celebration grew within minutes into a thunderous barrage , as helicopters swooped out of the darkness to join in the overwhelming israeli force left at least five palestinians dead after a 22hour siege , during which they detained and interrogated 43 residents of the town and arrested 11 of them , the soldiers left early this morning palestinian assertions of a massacre here of at least 10 people , made wednesday while israeli troops barred independent observers from the village , appeared today to be overstated but a reconstruction of the operation shows how closely the incursions , which israel has described as a police action to round up terrorists , in fact resemble war in a telephone interview tonight , the commander of the israeli operation said that while all five men killed were carrying weapons , at least three of them were not shooting palestinians said two or three of them were trying to escape the commander , a colonel who asked that he not be identified , said his troops killed two policemen in one case , he said , a policeman with a semiautomatic rifle approached soldiers but did not fire before he was killed in the other case , he said , the policeman shot first the helicopters , he said , killed two or three security men who were running through the village in an attempt to escape , palestinians said you ca n't allow armed palestinians running inside the village while your forces are inside , the commander said no israelis were injured in the raid , he said under treaty , palestinian security forces are licensed by israel to carry weapons , and beit rima is in territory that is under palestinian civil and security control gen gershon itzhak , the commander of forces in the west bank , said he had contacted local commanders half an hour before the raid and urged them to keep their men indoors palestinian political and military officials denied that any warning was given the commander said that during the operation the safety of civilians was a higher priority than the safety of his own men , if only for practical reasons you do n't have to be a prophet to understand that if you finish an operation like that with civilian casualties it s a disaster for israel s prestige , he said he said almost all the shooting ended about 20 minutes into the operation , but residents disputed that today , blood and tissue from two of those said to have been slain by helicopter fire remained at the bottom of a stone wall in an orchard just east of the middle of town bees buzzed over them , and curious or mourning villagers clustered around the anger of some here today was not directed only at israel they used the helicopters that you gave to them , you americans , said nafiz al sheikh , a commander of the local forces you are the main reason for our disaster another man displayed one of the huge rounds he said was fired by apache helicopers used in the raid with a bitter smile , he called it an american present for our people the israelis have occupied parts of seven west bank towns , including beit rima , since the killing last week of israel s tourism minister , rehavam zeevi apparently in reaction to the troops' departure from this village , ari fleischer , president bush s spokesman , today hailed what he called a partial pullout five more palestinians were killed in fighting in the west bank today , four of them in bethlehem , palestinians said prime minister ariel sharon met late tonight with some cabinet ministers to discuss the timing of a withdrawal from other positions in palestinian territory abdul karin jasser , the mayor of beit rima , acknowledged that palestinian claims of the number of dead appeared to be overstated , although he added that he could not be sure until everyone who had fled during the violence returned home the mayor said that of the five known to be killed , three were from the palestinian security forces and two were police officers he said the overwhelming israeli force was senselessly lethal they were shooting indiscriminately from helicopters , he said he said the security complement of the town was eight men from the palestinian security forces and six or seven policemen do you think this number requires all these soldiers and tanks \? he asked the israeli forces included at least two helicopter gunships and several tanks and armored personnel carriers though a palestinian man displayed what appeared to be a tank shell , the commander said no shells had been fired it was a sentiment echoed around the village if the israelis were truly out to make some arrests , said one resident , abdul jalil barghouti , five army jeeps could have entered without a problem
chicago , march 6 president bush took his pitch for a 16 trillion tax cut to the floor of the chicago mercantile exchange today , using the backdrop of frenetic trading activity and pork bellies signs for his claim that the measure was necessary to keep such markets robust in blunt terms , mr bush pressed his stated concern that the nation s economy was ailing , and said that lowering taxes was the tonic that would restore it to health we 're facing a problem , mr bush said as he stood at a lectern set up in the exchange s live cattle pit , where traders buy and sell that particular commodity and the problem is our economy s slowing down you all know that as well as anybody does , he continued this kind of great boom is starting to sputter a little bit and the question you need to be asking the president is , 'what do you intend to do about it , mr president \? ' and here it is that remedy , mr bush said , was restraint in federal spending , debt repayment and a cut of tax rates there was a nonetoofaint echo in mr bush s appearance here of his father s footsteps in 1991 , when george bush the elder was president , he made a visit to the exchange amid concerns at that time about a cooling economy but the older bush was not selling what the younger bush is today s appearance was the latest appeal in an aggressive marketing campaign for the 10year taxcut plan , which is shaping up as the defining battle of the new president s first year that campaign today centered on an expression of worry about the direction of the economy though his speech lasted just 13 minutes , mr bush made a second mention of making sure this economy does n't continue to sputter hours earlier , a white house spokesman , scott mcclellan , had talked to reporters of our sputtering economy but another strategy mr bush employed today , as in previous weeks , was presenting himself as a bipartisan , democratloving kind of guy an image intended to undercut some critics' suggestions that his tax cut was emblematic of an extremely conservative agenda and that he was being inflexible about it before his speech , he had lunch with mayor richard m daley , who is not just a democrat but also the brother of william daley , the chairman of vice president al gore s presidential campaign mr bush and mayor daley , seated at a whiteclothed table with a floral centerpiece , permitted reporters , photographers and television cameras to catch a fleeting peek of them i just got a lesson in chicago politics , mr bush said , referring to the conversation he had been having with mr daley he added that it was his second lesson in six months the first , apparently , had been losing the state of illinois to mr gore during his subsequent speech , mr bush said of mr daley he s a really good mayor he s a good mayor of a big city we 've had our time for politics now it s time to do what s right for our country and for the cities democrats contend that what is right for the country is a tax cut less sweeping and less generous to wealthy taxpayers than mr bush s they have proposed alternatives that they say would preserve important spending priorities or leave more money for debt repayment mayor daley did not weigh in on that debate but president bush s speech on the floor was aimed more directly at two chicagoarea democrats who will be part of the house vote on thursday on the core of his tax plan an acrosstheboard reduction in tax rates administration officials said they hoped both democrats representatives rod r blagojevich and william o lipinski of illinois might back the president an aide to mr blagojevich said today that the congressman was officially undecided but unlikely to vote for the plan but an aide to mr lipinski suggested he was more favorably inclined toward the tax cut unlike mr blagojevich , mr lipinski was on the floor of the exchange , and he flew back to washington aboard air force one this evening so that he could talk with mr bush speaker j dennis hastert was also on the flight mr bush alluded to that conversation in his speech , saying of mr lipinski he and i will have a little quality time together and mr bush again made a direct appeal to voters i'm here to ask for your help see , i believe in the power of the people i truly do i do i believe that when you email a congressman or a senator , it makes a difference it makes a difference and so that s why i'm traveling the country and that s why i came here photo president bush met traders as he toured the chicago mercantile exchange yesterday , part of his campaign to build support for his taxcut plan \( associated press \)
the holidays are coming , the ranked teams and the big east schedule are looming and st john s is still trying to find itself barely two weeks removed from its low point of the season a 17point loss to manhattan the red storm barely avoided another shocker last night st francis of brooklyn pushed a lethargic team for 30 minutes before finally succumbing , 8982 , to st john s at alumni hall say this for the terriers , last season s darlings of local basketball they produced the best effort by a st francis team in this rivalry in nearly 40 years the last time st francis finished within 10 points of st john s was jan 19 , 1963 , a 5352 loss st john s \( 72 \) won its 24th straight meeting dating to the last st francis victory , in 1956 it is frustrating , said st francis coach ron ganulin , who lost four starters from an 1811 team i thought it was winnable st john s has been known for beating its local competition by relying on solid defense , strong rebounding and a dynamic scorer , none of which has been revealed this season we 're finding it every night , coach mike jarvis said of his team s identity we 're finding that when we 're patient we 're very good st john s patience will be sorely tested tomorrow , when it plays no 20 wake forest at madison square garden the red storm has already lost convincingly to manhattan this season and appeared capable of even a bigger indignity last night it displayed some of its worst stretches during a 130 run by st francis \( 52 \) in the first half that gave the terriers a 3020 lead that led to loud boos by the lessthan capacity crowd the st john s players looked disheartened this is our hometown , the freshman eric king said referring to the fans , he said in their eyes we 're expected to win they want us to do well , so they 're going to get on us when we do bad that s what fans do i looked at it like they 're right , we 're supposed to be on top they 're going to get on us i appreciate that jarvis said , i did n't hear any boos , and he even suggested that anyone saying so could possibly be not telling the truth there was no denying st francis' 4241 halftime lead but the red storm scored the first 7 points after the break and never trailed again king , a forward , scored a careerhigh 19 points the red storm came into the game shooting 388 percent from the field , but shot 552 percent last night , led by king s 8for11 night king also grabbed five rebounds and blocked three shots the senior forward anthony glover scored 14 of his 21 points in the first half and made 8 of 16 shots eleven st john s players played at least eight minutes , and ganulin said the red storm s depth wore out his inexperienced terriers but it certainly took long enough the st john s lead was just 5554 with 11 minutes 6 seconds left , but st francis could not get closer than 6 points in the final 7 minutes
american express did not fully comprehend the risk it was taking , explained its chief executive , kenneth i chenault , as he announced corporate america s latest bath , this one for 826 million the saga of this bath reflects many trends of the recent boom companies took risks to get the kind of profits that would impress wall street , sometimes involving derivatives when prices were high , they had no fear the american express mea culpa also is representative of how corporate america is responding to the new environment it is firing people , with as many as 5 , 000 jobs to be eliminated , in the hope that cutting costs will produce profits it is more reluctant to take risks on investments and while it was quite willing to buy back its own stock at high prices last year , now it will buy fewer shares as derivatives go , collateralized debt obligations are not all that complicated a diversified collection of junk bonds or risky bank loans are put together , and then securities backed by that collection are sold the riskiest of them , sometimes called toxic waste , will pay out only if everything goes right the best will be fine unless the entire portfolio defaults , and so on through the quality spectrum american express went big for them in 1997 and early 1998 back then , recalled jeremy gluck , the moody s expert on such things , the people who packaged those securities sold them with explanations of what would happen if 2 percent of junk bonds went into default each year now the default rate is 8 percent , and investments that seemed safe are producing losses american express assumes the default rate will not improve until 2003 as it happens , a leading packager of collateralized debt obligations is none other than american express , which now admits it did not understand the risks very well such ignorance may not be uncommon there are all kinds of transactions going on out there where one party does n't understand it , richard m kovacevich , the chief executive of wells fargo , said in an interview yesterday that lack of knowledge is a function of the strides that have been made in financial engineering derivatives make it possible to shift risks in ways that were undreamed of even a decade ago but the computer models used to figure out how to value those risks are sometimes not very good most of the pricing is done on a very unsophisticated basis , mr gluck of moody s said collateralized debt obligations are still selling well , and pricing is more realistic than it was in early 1998 but american express says it will not take such risks again , although it will keep manufacturing such derivative securities to be sold to its institutional clients \( would you patronize a chef who wo n't eat his own cooking \? \) the newfound aversion to risk is not restricted to american express banks are charging higher interest rates and demanding more covenants on corporate loans , thus tightening credit for many borrowers at the same time the federal reserve tries to make borrowing less expensive capital spending is plummeting and industrial production is at recessionary levels but recession has been averted because consumers are still spending it is the great dichotomy of 2001 , but it is not a split that can endure forever individuals , in their roles as investors and consumers , are showing they expect an early recovery but much of corporate america is preparing for a period of sustained sluggishness hopes for recovery may ride on which side concludes it was wrong chart shows collateral debt obligations new issue volume since 1996
when al leiter is at his best , his slider breaks late and sharply , in on the hands of righthanded hitters , breaking their bats or forcing them to ground weakly to third base leiter got broken bats and grounders to third last night at yankee stadium , but it was not a winning formula he was careless at times and unlucky , and third baseman robin ventura was not physically sound the mets sank to last place ventura left the game with a strained right shoulder after four innings in the mets' 83 loss to the yankees the injury resulted in a throwing error in the third inning that led to four unearned runs , continuing a trend for leiter leiter \( 48 \) lasted five innings , allowing seven runs , three earned he is 15 in his last six starts , but his earned run average is 308 he has given up 12 unearned runs in his last 38 innings the season of losing is wearing on leiter and the mets you ca n't look at the big picture , leiter said , because the big picture is too gray and too fuzzy gray , fuzzy , depressing , upsetting leiter used those words to describe what has happened to the mets , who are a seasonworst 13 games under 500 first baseman todd zeile admitted he was out of the right language we 've used too many adjectives this year , he said i do n't even know if it s surprising anymore it s just kind of the way it s gone let s hope it changes every time the mets allow themselves to hope , something bad befalls them edgardo alfonzo returned to the mets' lineup on tuesday , and mike piazza returned last night , but now ventura is out ventura felt pain in his shoulder when he jammed it diving for a grounder by shane spencer leading off the third inning he came out after making a sidearm throw to first to end the fourth ventura was in obvious pain , gritting his teeth and grimacing as he threw i do n't like to come out for any reason , ventura said you obviously question it when you come out of the game but tomorrow , it just depends on how it feels ventura did not consider the injury serious , but manager bobby valentine said he would rest ventura today and perhaps tomorrow with the threeday allstar game break to follow , ventura could have five days to rest the shoulder ventura had surgery to remove torn cartilage from his shoulder in december 1999 and never fully recovered last season he batted 232 and found himself taking unnatural routes to ground balls , surrounding them instead of going directly at them if it would make the throw easier on his shoulder he also guessed more at the plate because he could not simply react to pitches ventura s history of shoulder problems makes the injury a bit more of a concern hopefully , the rest that he s going to get now without aggravating it will make it fine after the break , valentine said ventura has hit 169 since june 13 , and his average has tumbled to 259 , from 294 he has also made five errors in his past 18 games after making just one in his first 65 he had no explanation for the dropoff and said the shoulder had not bothered him until last night nothing s bothered me , ventura said just poor play after spencer s grounder , jorge posada followed with another grounder to ventura , and the throw to first bounced in the dirt zeile scooped it for the out , but he could not dig out ventura s next throw , on a grounder by gerald williams that throw got past zeile for a twobase error a runscoring single and a walk later , alfonso soriano homered to left to put the yankees ahead , 70 leiter s troubles began well before the third inning derek jeter singled with one out in the first , and bernie williams grounded a ball through the left side against any other team , catcher todd pratt said , shortstop rey ord ez would have been in position to field that ball easily but the mets shift toward the middle against the yankees with leiter pitching ord ez , also wary of a hitandrun , was nowhere near it spencer walked on an 11pitch atbat to load the bases posada rolled a single into left field for one run , and after a strikeout , scott brosius looped a brokenbat , tworun single to left leiter said that none of the hits would have blackened a person s eye there s a little bit of pfft , i ca n't believe this is happening again , here we go again , said leiter , who later added it happens , and i understand that s part of the game but it almost seems fitting for what has gone on here and what we have experienced after his last start , a 52 loss in atlanta last saturday in which the braves scored all of their runs with two outs , leiter was not interested in dissecting the details of the game he did so last night , but the details seem less and less important these days the mets lose , and they keep losing pratt said he did not care about being in last place with 75 games left in the season but there is an overwhelming probability that those 75 games will mean nothing in the pennant race the mets seem to know that we compete and we do n't do our job , and we come in here and try to have a positive spirit and morale , leiter said you 're supposed to be happy it s not happy photo the mets' mike piazza singling in a run in the sixth inning last night piazza hit his 21st homer in the fourth \( chang w lee the new york times \)

since 1990 , as all four major north american professional sports leagues expanded and teams agitated for new homes or moved to new cities , 21 new stadiums and 30 arenas have been built across the continent a remarkable construction boom eleven more arenas and stadiums are under construction from pittsburgh to seattle , and financing has been or is nearly secured for nine others yet over that time , no major league stadium or arena has been built in the new york metropolitan area the newest in the region is continental arena in the new jersey meadowlands , which opened 20 years ago the oldest , yankee stadium , was completed in 1923 and rebuilt in the 1970 s there are many reasons bigleague ballparks in the new york region are older than those in the rest of the country many independent consultants and local elected officials say part of the blame lies with george steinbrenner , the principal owner of the yankees , who has failed to resolve where he wants his team to play in the future while the yankees have talked intermittently with city and state officials about a new stadium , plans for other teams , including the mets , have been delayed , many people said mr steinbrenner is still intrigued by the possibility of a new ballpark on the west side of manhattan , several officials familiar with his thinking said , even though nearly all of the city s senior elected officials and many community and civic groups are opposed teams in the new yorknew jersey area also tend to be highrevenue operations , because of the region s huge fan base and television audience that makes local and state governments less enthusiastic about spending huge amounts of taxpayers' money to build new stadiums and arenas the teams' financial wellbeing also makes it harder for them to make credible threats to leave the region , which is the leverage often used by professional teams across the country to get public financing for new buildings several new yorkers asserted that the inability to keep up with the national building boom was not a problem at all the region s stadiums and arenas are still in relatively good condition , they said , and there is no need to rush to replace them but others said the region had fallen behind most of the country this has occurred even though new york city has been governed since 1994 by mayor rudolph w giuliani , an avid baseball fan and a relentless booster of new stadiums so far , he has succeeded only in building two minorleague baseball stadiums a lack of consensus as other cities converted wishes and blueprints into sports xanadus , whatever lust for new stadiums existed regionally has been stalled by indecision and a lack of political consensus in most other markets , you have one city , with one team in each category , but new york has multiple teams , making it more difficult , said roger goodell , the executive vice president of the national football league whatever you do for the yankees , you have to do for the mets , and whatever you do for the mets , you have to do for the jets indicative of new york s plight is the mets , whose coowner , fred wilpon , proposed building a retrostyle stadium with a retractable roof in 1998 the plan has barely moved forward it s a shame , mr wilpon said i think the resources are there , but it s a complex and difficult process while the yankees' indecision has hurt the mets , so has the mets' inability to agree with city and state officials on how much of the team s proposed 500 million ballpark , designed to echo ebbets field , would be financed by the government and how much by the team similarly , the nets and the devils , now along with the yankees jointly owned by the corporation called yankeenets , have not yet worked out with new jersey officials how much the state and local governments would pay to help the teams build a new 350 million arena in newark for hockey and basketball because the metropolitan region is large and affluent and it is not struggling to attract or retain bigleague teams there is not the same impetus to build new stadiums that exists elsewhere , marc s ganis , a sports finance consultant , said there has been inertia , he said , but it goes to the point that the new york market is so rich without any new stadiums that there is none of the urgency we saw in cleveland or baltimore , where they needed new stadiums the devils made the most serious threat to leave the area , when they were wooed in 1995 to be the primary tenant of a new arena in nashville the team eventually chose to renegotiate its lease at continental arena most teams in the new york area , except the giants and the islanders , are operating under leases that date from the 1970 s and 1980 s and are to expire no later than 2008 the urgency to build has been conspicuously absent in a region where the yankees have drawn more than three million fans in each of the past two seasons and won four of the past five

washington , sept 29 the united states is inadequately prepared to confront bioterrorist attacks , according to a broad range of health experts and officials the nation must develop new vaccines and treatments , they say , but it must also fortify its fragile public health infrastructure , the first line of defense in detecting and containing biological threats bioterrorism the intentional release of potentially lethal viruses or bacteria into the air , food or water supply poses daunting technical challenges , and experts say it would be difficult to carry out a successful attack still , many believe it is inevitable that someone will eventually try it in the united states in the weeks since the sept 11 attacks on the world trade center and the pentagon , much of the discussion about bioterrorism has centered on a shortage of antibiotics and vaccines but the bigger problem , officials agree , is a lack of basic public health infrastructure and preparedness that could thwart a terror attack or limit its effects doctors are poorly trained to recognize symptoms of infection with possible biological weapons , like plague and anthrax , which can resemble the flu many of the nation s hospitals lack necessary equipment in some cases even simple tools like fax machines to receive or report information in an emergency though a number of federal agencies have established bioterrorism response teams and procedures , and there has been steady improvement in laboratory facilities around the country to test and identify biological agents , the result is a patchwork , set against a larger patchwork of cities , counties and states with their own reporting requirements and plans for bioterrorism , the no 1 inadequacy , if you had to rank them , is the inadequacy of our public health infrastructure , said senator bill frist , republican of tennessee that is a product of about 15 years of neglect in a report issued last week , the general accounting office said the government s bioterrorism planning was so disjointed that the agencies involved could not even agree on which biological agents posed the biggest threat officials at the centers for disease control and prevention , for instance , consider smallpox a major risk but the federal bureau of investigation does not even put smallpox on its list at the same time , there are holes in the federal bureaucracy , where two important health positions remain unfilled commissioner of food and drugs and director of the national institutes of health the food and drug administration will play a crucial role in the development of vaccines or treatments for use in the event of a biological attack , but president bush and congress in particular senator edward m kennedy , democrat of massachusetts have been unable to agree on an acceptable nominee federal officials got a taste of how complicated , and chilling , a bioterrorist attack could be during a war game played at andrews air force base , outside washington , in june the exercise , codenamed dark winter , began with a report of a single case of smallpox in oklahoma city by the time it was over , the imaginary epidemic had spread to 25 states and killed several million people as it unfolded , growing grimmer and grimmer , the government quickly ran out of vaccine , forcing officials to make lifeanddeath decisions about who would be protected health workers \? soldiers \? and whether the military would have to be brought in to quarantine patients dark winter showed just how unprepared we are to deal with bioterrorism , said jerome m hauer , the former head of emergency management in new york city and now a bioterrorism consultant to tommy g thompson , the secretary of the department of health and human services it pointed out that there were significant challenges to all levels of government to meet those challenges , senators kennedy and frist are urging president bush to spend at least 1 billion on a range of measures that , they say , will improve the ability of health officials to combat bioterrorism in an interview , mr thompson agreed that improvements were needed , although he said the government was prepared to handle an attack right now i would like to expand our pharmaceutical supplies , mr thompson said i would like to strengthen the public health system i would like to get some more inspectors for the food supply i would like to expand security in our laboratories i would like to purchase more vaccine for years , federal officials considered the threat of bioterrorism to be negligible but concern began to mount in 1995 , after a japanese cult , aum shinrikyo , launched nerve gas attacks in the tokyo subways in the wake of the world trade center and pentagon attacks , some members of the public have developed intense fears of germ warfare , and are trying to stock up on their own supplies we have people buying gas masks and antibiotics when that is not going to provide real protection , said stephen s morse , director of the center for public health preparedness at columbia university
tampa , fla for most of the last three years , the dozens of temporaryemployment agencies in this city have had a problem they could not find enough qualified workers for the openings that local companies needed to fill renate hartman , who runs a branch of snelling personnel services , noticed last year that many of the available candidates did not dress up for job interviews lee rachelson , the founder of a small staffing company , said she had to post job listings on the internet so she could recruit people from other cities to move to tampa i could not find anybody here , ms rachelson recalled i was just in a panic today , however , only five months after the unemployment rate for the tampa metropolitan area fell to 24 percent , a whole new category of people are worried temporary workers themselves across this sprawling region of glass skyscrapers , eightmilelong bridges and one of the highest proportions of temporary jobs in the nation , workers have suddenly found themselves plentiful and jobs scarce the number of applicants at some agencies has doubled , while the number of job listings has fallen 20 percent or more in the last few months more people with at least a year or two of college education are now looking for temporary jobs , recruiters say and while few people here said they expected to remain out of work for long , many have resigned themselves to taking a pay cut for their next job it s just been hard trying to find a job , said samuel j gilbert , a 31yearold father of two who was recently laid off from his temporary job making pastries and expected that his next job would probably be on a construction crew it s just been real hard the struggle of the more than three million temporary workers nationwide is perhaps the starkest sign of how rapidly the labor market has shifted since late last year for the first time in 10 years , there are more workers than jobs , said richard a walquist , an executive vice president at the american staffing association , a washington group that represents temporary agencies in september of last year , when the national unemployment rate fell below 4 percent for the first time since 1970 , the number of people employed by staffing firms stood at 35 million , three times the level of a decade ago since then , however , the overall jobless rate has climbed to 45 percent , and temporary employment has borne the brunt of it , falling by 20 percent , or 500 , 000 people that is more than the combined payroll reductions at automakers , restaurants , hotels and department stores in the last recession , from the summer of 1990 through early 1991 , the agencies' work force fell less than 13 percent , according to the bureau of labor statistics we 're seeing a faster reaction , said jeffrey a joerres , the chief executive of manpower , which on a typical day employs 170 , 000 temporary workers , some of whom in fact stay on a job for months or even years companies are telling manpower , mr joerres explained , that we do n't have the demand , so we do n't need the people for companies , the ability to expand and contract a temporary work force can improve efficiency and , in the best case , might allow the economy to rebound more quickly but even if that happens , a group of people who never fully joined in the long boom , because they tend to make less money and receive fewer benefits than regular workers , will struggle to get by in the coming months , economists say at the least , some of the people who were drawn to temporary work during the long economic expansion are having to pay for the flexibility it has given them with a sudden increase in job insecurity this is a perfect example of how the new economy should work , said mark zandi , the chief economist of economycom , a consulting firm in west chester , pa it highlights the more flexible nature of the labor market but there s a lot of pain and suffering that these struggles are now common in tampa s serviceheavy economy also indicates that the nation s economic slowdown has spread well beyond the industrial midwest the tampa area , which includes st petersburg and the resort towns of the gulf of mexico coast , has few corporate headquarters , and it relies on backoffice outposts and the tourism industry for many of its jobs with wages below the national average and a large influx of new residents each year , temporarystaffing companies have thrived but even as the region s overall economy continues to grow , many people have found their financial situation becoming more precarious over the last year stacy l back graduated from the university of south florida s tampa campus in december 1999 , and snelling personnel services quickly found her a temporary job at sourcetrack , a local internet company it eventually turned into a permanent position , and ms back liked the job so much that she decided she wanted to spend her career working with technology , she said last month , however , sourcetrack went out of business every door i 've knocked on , they say , 'we have a hiring freeze on , ' she said , adding that the few openings she has found are for lowpaying clerical jobs
first of all , to avoid any confusion as we go along , mount everett is not mount everest mount everett is nestled in the southwest corner of massachusetts in a wonderfully wooded part of the berkshires mount everest is much farther away , and i do n't think you say it is nestled anywhere mount everett is easy to ascend the air is thick the walk is short in fact you can drive most of the way up the mountain rises 2 , 600 feet above sea level , less than a tenth the elevation of everest but it is the second tallest peak in massachusetts and although you do n't need oxygen tanks , crampons or special protection from the elements to stand on its top and survey the summering grounds of many migratory new yorkers , there is something fierce about the summit perhaps it s the wind or the cold of winter or the way the ridges and ravines of the southern taconic mountains insist on a new england ruggedness the summit is covered , not with the forest one might expect at this altitude but with an unusual lowlying mix of stunted pitch pines , gnarled and bent into intriguing shapes , and scrub oak and huckleberry nothing fancy , nothing soft nothing that will fade or fall when it is covered with ice at this altitude it is unusual not to have larger trees covering the summit none of the pines look to be more than six feet tall , if that , but they range up to 170 years old they are not majestic like big old trees , not stunning like redwoods but trees can offer inspiration in small ways , too these speak of grit and survival they remind me of kipling s tale of the mongoose , rikki tikki tavi , who clamped his teeth on a cobra s head expecting to die but determined to be found with his jaws locked the pines on mount everett have bitten down on the mountain and are not letting go i went to visit mount everett and its pines after talking to robert t leverett , a hunter of old and big trees , and one of the people pushing a search for patches of oldgrowth forest in the northeast that started in the 1980 s and is still gaining momentum among his many forestrelated tasks , he is in charge of making an inventory of oldgrowth sites in massachusetts , and he is writing a visitors' guide to oldgrowth sites with bruce kershner somehow , he also has time for a day job as a systems analyst the common view until the mid80 s , mr leverett said when i spoke to him by telephone , was that the east had been so heavily logged that there were no old trees left far from the truth , he said the trees are here in patches , 300 to 400 years old , with the odd individual over 500 years old either they were varieties of trees that nobody wanted or the trek up or down a cliff to reach them was not worth the effort mr leverett points out that there is a great deal of scientific discussion on what constitutes old growth for most of us , he wrote in an article on southern new england forests , old growth implies a multiaged forest shaped by natural events over several centuries another definition says that old growth forests look largely as they would if europeans had not settled north america mr leverett was full of recommendations about what sites to visit there is katterskill falls in the catskills , with 60 acres of large , charismatic trees , 300 to 400 years old there are the shawangunks in new york sages ravine in northwestern connecticut , on the appalachian trail a treasure of hundreds of thousands of acres in the adirondacks , much of it in the west canada lakes area and near piseco lake cook forest state park in western pennsylvania , with 250 to 300yearold white pines a new hampshire black gum over 600 years old trees in massachusetts 500 years old the list goes on and on the patches of forest have been found , mr leverett said , by walking the great majority of it has been stomping the forest and looking at places that were basically inaccessible to horseandoxen logging and not all the trees are big often the big story will be that we find these diminutive trees , and they turn out to be the oldest nor are they all inaccessible mount everett , for instance , is in the berkshires , although a particularly rural corner where some roads are not maintained in the winter but it has a mix of trees , some true oldgrowth hemlocks near gilder pond , circled by an easy trail , part way to the top , and the old but not quite oldgrowth pines on its peak i picked it for the little trees , even though they do n't qualify as oldgrowth , and my reason had nothing to do with forests the image of the world trade center towers continues to invade my thoughts in ways large and small the often repeated comment that everything has changed usually refers to a sense of safety , views on civil liberties or preparations for war but the small effects on metaphor and imagination may be equally telling i found it uncomfortable to think of towering trees reaching to the heavens i know that all this has to do with the images i impose on the trees , not the trees themselves , but i just did n't want to see trees built for vertical strength
chicago , july 30 business is good at the cactus bar in downtown chicago , but only because it s bad elsewhere people come in for a couple of drinks with their friends because they do n't want to shell out for the big movies and concerts , said naresh nair , manager of the cactus dropping 50 for a night at the movies or 200 for a couple of concert tickets just is n't realistic anymore the time when people spent that kind of money for a night out is over this is a long , cool summer in much of the entertainment world concert tours are being curtailed or postponed , with performers like rod stewart playing to rows of empty seats highly touted films like pearl harbor have had disappointing runs the closest the book industry has come to a summer pageturner is an unwieldy biography of a founding father ticket sales on broadway are flat and would be down if not for two sellout shows , the producers and the lion king when things slow down , everything slows down , said jeff dorenfeld , who teaches music business at the berklee college of music in boston prices keep going up , but there s less money to go around it s affecting the whole industry interviews across the country in recent days suggest that people are spending more time outdoors or at home this summer some statistics support that conclusion television ratings , video rentals and sales of computer games are all up over last summer the film industry , which had been holding its collective breath hoping for a midsummer hit to pull it out of a flat season , finally had one last weekend with planet of the apes it took in 695 million between friday and sunday , the biggest nonholiday threeday opening in history but that success follows a number of expensive and heavily marketed disappointments , including some movies , like ai and jurassic park iii , which did well the first weekend and then mysteriously plunged in subsequent weeks jurassic park , for example , did about half as much business its second weekend as it had done in its first one reason for the doldrums may be the slumping economy money has becomes tighter , but prices for entertainment have continued to rise concert tickets often cost more than 50 and can run beyond 200 , hardcover novels routinely cost at least 25 , and more cinemas are approaching the 10aticket level some people cite other factors , including the conviction that there are simply not that many good movies out there the studios appear obsessed with appealing to teenagers , who might see the same movie repeatedly , and they end up churning out junk as a result they 're telling the same story over and over , said neha vyas , a 28yearold doctor in houston i guess we 've gotten to the age where we 've seen so many movies that with some of these movies we 're like , 'wait a minute this was the same movie that i saw five or 10 years ago but with a different character' it s kind of boring mr dorenfeld said that baby boomers were tired of seeing secondtier bands from the 1960 s and 70 s and that their children shifted allegiance from one band to another so quickly that new ones had trouble building fan loyalty lorraine shanley , director of market partners international , a new yorkbased company that advises clients in the publishing industry , said that the proliferation of media results in smaller pieces of the pie for everyone she added everyone has noticed it it s a doldrums period that s probably tied to the economy and everyone s fear of things getting worse it may turn out to be just a blip in the long term , but the combination of indicators looks awfully coincidental film executives said that one reason some films were doing well the first weekend of release and then fading was a change in distribution with the spread of multiscreen cinemas , there tends to be a stampede the first weekend , and then the movie loses its buzz as a new one is offered for instance , ai , steven spielberg s sciencefiction fantasy , grossed 294 million in its first weekend , which the trade paper variety called respectable , but it took in less than half that much on its second weekend no longer is this going to be a cavalcade of hits , variety said in a frontpage report repeat business has been surprisingly scarce among those who have forsaken the cinema in favor of television this summer is max sontos , a 27yearold actor in los angeles , who said that after the expense and complications of his last trip to a movie theater , he would rather just veg and watch tv he is evidently not alone according to nielsen media research , all four major daytime cable networks and four of the five evening channels are attracting more viewers than they did last summer the video rental giant blockbuster announced last week that its secondquarter revenue was 123 billion , up from 121 billion for the same period last year sales of video game hardware , software and accessories are running 28 percent ahead of last year although none of this has led film executives to panic , several have concluded that they , like concert promoters and booksellers , need to assess a rapidly changing marketplace
houston , june 12 barry mandel , director of the downtown theater district association , stood outside jones hall today , home to the houston symphony , and listened not to violins but to the groan of a generator pumping water from the flooded bowels of the auditorium below , the music library may be ruined instruments are floating in chestdeep water across the street , the basement stage inside the alley theater was drenched , and the electrical system was broken next door at the wortham theater center , the performance hall for the city s ballet and opera , the costumes for the coming performance of cleopatra that were stored in the underground dressing rooms may be ruined like nearly everyone else in this bayou city , mr mandel was stunned by the ferocity of tropical storm allison , which was blamed for at least 20 deaths and which dropped nearly three feet of water in some places last weekend but in explaining the tremendous flooding downtown , mr mandel pointed not to the sky , but below , to a set of doors that opened into a tunnel the water , he said , came from there the explanation for the record flooding here last weekend is fairly simple it rained so much and so fast that the drainage system in this tabletop city laced with bayous was overwhelmed as neighborhoods became lakes and highways became canals but downtown , the water also rushed down the ramps of parking garages and poured through some sections of the maze of tunnels that shield pedestrians from the weather and connect the city s signature skyscrapers , particularly around the theater district , creating a flood above ground and below this really was a flood that was totally out of the realm of experience or expectation down here , said joseph colaco , a university of houston professor who worked as a structural engineer on many of the downtown skyscrapers with floodwaters having receded , problems were still evident today even as life seemed fairly normal away from downtown , the texas medical center , home to an array of hospitals and research institutions , continued to struggle with power failures and underground flooding officials with the compaq center canceled thursday s game for the city s women s professional basketball team thousands of people continued to work on flooded homes and businesses the arena is now dry , but during the flood the basketball court itself was floating on four feet of water people returned to office buildings downtown today , but work crews continued furiously pumping water from below jones hall and other nearby buildings , including at least two skyscrapers at the peak of the flooding early saturday , the threelevel underground parking garage for the theater district was believed to be filled with 87 million gallons of water half of that amount must still be removed usually , the city beneath the city , is a respite from the weather just as people in minneapolis can walk on skyways from building to building to stay warm in winter , houstonians can move beneath the city during the boiling summers through the airconditioned tunnels , as well as eat at underground food courts and shop at underground stores today , much of the tunnel system was unaffected and was open mr colaco , the structural engineer , characterized the flooding as unprecedented and said that problems downtown did not mean that the tunnels were prone to flooding houston is not the only american city to suffer underground flooding in its business and commercial district in april 1992 , the chicago loop was closed for a week when a freight tunnel under the chicago river was breached , sending nearly 250 million gallons of water coursing through the city s tunnel system and into basements city hall and the sears tower , as well as the chicago board of trade and the chicago mercantile exchange , were closed by the flooding the houston flooding was at its worst in the theater district , where the tunnels were transformed into rivers that flowed into the performance halls and wreaked considerable damage , if not to the main performance stages , then to nearly everything else that flooding was accentuated by the district s location all four of the city s main performance halls face jones plaza , a short walk from the waters of buffalo bayou the impact on the city s cultural life was immediate two performances of giselle have been canceled , and the coming weekend performances are uncertain the carpetbagger s children , the horton foote play that had its world premiere last week at the alley theater , has been moved to a theater a few miles away jennifer garza , a spokeswoman for the alley theater , said that the basementlevel stage being used for the foote production was heavily damaged and that the theater s electrical system was not working it suffered extensive damage from water that came in through the tunnel system , ms garza said she also said the theater s underground offices suffered greatly as water damaged artist renderings for set designs and other materials , things that are irreplaceable , ms garza said
washington , nov 30 attorney general john ashcroft is considering a plan to relax restrictions on the fbi s spying on religious and political organizations in the united states , senior government officials said today the proposal would loosen one of the most fundamental restrictions on the conduct of the federal bureau of investigation and would be another step by the bush administration to modify civilliberties protections as a means of defending the country against terrorists , the senior officials said the attorney general s surveillance guidelines were imposed on the fbi in the 1970 s after the death of j edgar hoover and the disclosures that the fbi had run a widespread domestic surveillance program , called cointelpro , to monitor antiwar militants , the ku klux klan , the black panthers and the rev dr martin luther king jr , among others , while mr hoover was director since then , the guidelines have defined the fbi s operational conduct in investigations of domestic and overseas groups that operate in the united states some officials who oppose the change said the rules had largely kept the fbi out of politically motivated investigations , protecting the bureau from embarrassment and lawsuits but others , including senior justice department officials , said the rules were outmoded and geared to obsolete investigative methods and had at times hobbled fbi counterterrorism efforts mr ashcroft and the fbi director , robert s mueller iii , favor the change , the officials said most of the opposition comes from career officials at the fbi and the justice department a justice department spokeswoman said today that no final decision had been reached on the revised guidelines as part of the attorney general s reorganization , said susan dryden , the spokeswoman , we are conducting a comprehensive review of all guidelines , policies and procedures all of these are still under review an fbi spokesman said the bureau s approach to terrorism was also under review director mueller s view is that everything should be on the table for review , the spokesman , john collingwood , said he is more than willing to embrace change when doing so makes us a more effective component a healthy review process does n't come at the expense of the historic protections inherent in our system the attorney general is free to revise the guidelines , but justice department officials said it was unclear how heavily they would be revised there are two sets of guidelines , for domestic and foreign groups , and most of the discussion has centered on the largely classified rules for investigations of foreign groups the relaxation of the guidelines would follow administration measures to establish military tribunals to try foreigners accused of terrorism to seek out and question 5 , 000 immigrants , most of them muslims , who have entered the united states since january 2000 and to arrest more than 1 , 200 people , nearly all of whom are unconnected to the terrorist attacks of sept 11 , and hold hundreds of them in jail today , mr ashcroft defended his initiatives in an impassioned speech to united states attorneys our efforts have been deliberate , they 've been coordinated , they 've been carefully crafted to not only protect america but to respect the constitution and the rights enshrined therein , mr ashcroft said still , he added , there have been a few voices who have criticized some have sought to condemn us with faulty facts or without facts at all others have simply rushed to judgment , almost eagerly assuming the worst of their government before they 've had a chance to understand it at its best under the current surveillance guidelines , the fbi cannot send undercover agents to investigate groups that gather at places like mosques or churches unless investigators first find probable cause , or evidence leading them to believe that someone in the group may have broken the law full investigations of this sort cannot take place without the attorney general s consent since sept 11 , investigators have said , islamic militants have sometimes met at mosques apparently knowing that the religious institutions are usually off limits to fbi surveillance squads some officials are now saying they need broader authority to conduct surveillance of potential terrorists , no matter where they are senior career fbi officials complained that they had not been consulted about the proposed change a criticism they have expressed about other bush administration counterterrorism measures when the justice department decided to use military tribunals to try accused terrorists , and to interview thousands of muslim men in the united states , the officials said they were not consulted justice department officials noted that mr mueller had endorsed the administration s proposals , adding that the complaints were largely from older fbi officials who were resistant to change and unwilling to take the aggressive steps needed to root out terror in the united states other officials said the justice department had consulted with fbi lawyers and some operational managers about the change
we all cultivate an image , one we peddle to the world to define and promote ourselves it gives those around us a quick , easytoread version of a complex and fickle existence one of the city s master image peddlers is hank sheinkopf , a political consultant who has his fingers in a slew of primary races , including that of the mayoral candidate mark green in the business , he is known as the other hank , to distinguish himself from hank morris , a smoother , less bareknuckled image manipulator the two hanks have for years pitted candidates against each other in the rough world of new york politics their rivalry , and animosity , will come to a head again today in a kind of subtext to the race , when alan g hevesi , who has hired mr morris , goes up against mr green mr sheinkopf , 51 , who keeps about him the rough edges of his bluecollar upbringing , was wellschooled in brawling when asked if there were things he did when he began in the business that he might not do now , he said it would be to make very tough negative ads but then he thought a bit , and reversed himself i would do the same ones now he was born to a 19yearold father and a 15yearold mother in dr leff s hospital in the bronx , in the days when doctors ran their own hospitals not long after , he said , dr leff was carted off to jail for carrying out abortions there were three boys , he is the oldest , and the beatings , fights and poverty they grew up with did n't make for much of a home it was n't a marriage made in heaven , he said it was pretty brutal at the age of 8 , he and his two brothers , then 6 and 4 , were sent to a group home for boys in brewster , ny , called green chimneys , a place mr sheinkopf said that , for many , was the last stop before rikers island the brothers worked on a farm and went to the local public school he returned six years later to brooklyn his brothers were sent to live with relatives , and he lived with his mother and new stepfather the domestic violence was even worse , he said the beatings and fights brought the police to the apartment in flatbush a couple times a week he went to school with bruises and black eyes these were the days when no one interfered , he said the beatings stopped when i stood up to him and threatened to knife him while he was hitting my mother mr sheinkopf spent less and less time at home he worked odd jobs as a paperboy , in restaurants and carrying bolts of cloth in a textile factory by the age of 16 , he was on his own the directors of green chimneys , rollo and myra ross , who still run the facility , took him back he finished high school in brewster , then returned to new york and went to city college to support himself , he cut corned beef as a unionized restaurant worker i live in this amazing place , new york , he said a guy like me , anywhere else , would never get a shot i went to a free college i was in a union i got a decent wage it was then , looking to pick up some extra cash , that he got his first taste of politics he worked in herman badillo s campaign for mayor in 1969 he was based in the candidate s queens headquarters , working for 30 a week i thought if that guy came to america from puerto rico with nothing and became something , maybe i could , too ever since then , he said , he has worked for democrats who are prounion but after that campaign , he was drifting again he worked as a coffee boy on wall street , where he got to see the swells the guys with nice suits and manicured fingers who would sometimes drop dead from heart attacks because of all the stress for four years , mr sheinkopf worked as an investigator for the department of correction , and then with the port authority police one night , an alarm went off in a warehouse at kennedy airport he was the first one in the door later , it struck him that he could have been shot , and he decided it was not worth the risk he quit the next morning i did not want to die for strangers , he said i had to put some meaning in my life he gravitated toward campaigns , working with people like walter diamond , the political strategist he began to gain a reputation , and more business , because of his street smarts , his knowledge of what would sell outside of manhattan , and his sledgehammer approach to the opposition i brought a toughness , a combativeness and the need to win , he said he started his consulting firm in 1981 by 1995 , he was working in the clinton white house but what marked him most , he said , was the birth in june 1993 of his first child , isaac his public life remained a battleground , but his domestic life , he decided , would change he became an observant jew , and he does not work on the sabbath and when he spoke of his wife of 12 years , dr debra r budick , and of the love that runs between them , love he had lived without for most of his life , he teared up mr sheinkopf held up his hand to wait for his composure to return but there was one move into a more staid , urbane world he could not stomach his decision two years ago to live on the upper east side it is not my plate of soup , he said we will move there is no sense of community there is none of the rough and tumble of the city photo hank sheinkopf \( frances roberts for the new york times \)
a seam runs down the spine of michael connelly s new police procedural , a darkness more than night \( little , brown , 2595 \) , dividing the narrative between two detectives working two los angeles homicide cases and setting us up for the moment of truth when one of these investigators accuses the other of committing the crimes the plot device may be clever , but it does n't generate real tension because the cop accused of being a serial murderer is none other than connelly s longtime series hero , harry bosch , and unless an author is feeling suicidal , he s not about to sacrifice his hero for some cheap plot thrills bosch does n't see much action here , being stuck in court for the trial of a movie director accused of the sex slaying of a young actress a parable on unchecked hollywood avarice and excess , as the press would have it he is put in the frame , though , when terry mccaleb , the former fbi agent who demonstrated his profiling skills in blood work , is coaxed out of retirement to analyze a macabre ritual killing that he rashly attributes to bosch deepthinking and complex , bosch can withstand the character assassination but mccaleb s wasteful work and ponderous ruminations on the nature of good and evil are a real drag on connelly s driving narrative style the vibrant panorama of new york city in 1840 that randall silvis spreads before our eyes in on night s shore \( thomas dunne st martin s minotaur , 2495 \) bears little resemblance to the flat , static scenes that unroll like so much wallpaper in most historical mysteries even more arresting is his sleuth , a wildeyed newspaper journalist who signs himself e a poe and makes his meager living peddling sensational crime stories like the one that captures his imagination here the murder of a shopgirl , mary rogers , whose bloated body is discovered in the hudson river by augie dubbins , a 10yearold ragamuffin who narrates the tale from the vantage of an old man the lively investigation conducted by this oddly matched pair of sleuths is interesting in its own right , providing rich background on the seminal short story \( the mystery of marie rogt \) that helped establish poe as the father of ratiocinative detective fiction but let s give silvis his own creative due despite his mannered tendency to ape what augie calls poe s funny way with words , silvis delivers pungent impressions of the living city , exploring its mansions , slums , morgue , prisons , poorhouses and opium dens for all the ambient sounds and smells that define the character of a busy , brawling , unwashed metropolis the characters in thomas perry s surefooted adventures are always on the run what encourages us to trot after them is their ingenuity in getting where they 're going and the

people who know the events of the bay of pigs will not be surprised to read that when peter askin and i decided to write a movie about it , we made it a farce in fact , it was always our hope that paramount would advertise the film with the line , at last ! a comedy about the bay of pigs the facts support our approach given cold war tensions in the early 60 s and the way people used to be so jumpy about a nuclear war , the cia decided it could not move castro out of power in the agency s preferred manner \( in a coffin \) this was back when we still paid our un dues and hated to be embarrassed in front of the other countries with whom we often had cocktails so someone at the cia created a campaign to discredit castro , hoping to embarrass him out of power , on the uninformed assumption that politicians are susceptible to shame they laced his water with lsd so that when he drank it during a speech , he would hallucinate and look crazy they sent him a shoe polish that they hoped would make his hair fall out they dispatched exploding cigars you see how effective their campaign has been castro has been in power through 10 american administrations and has even outlived his date to the international prom , the soviet union , which was thought to be propping him up only dick clark has held on longer our film , company man , which opened on march 9 , dramatizes this campaign and creates as logical a reason for its existence as any we 've read , though , admittedly , we 've never read one in the film , i work for the cia sigourney weaver plays my wife john turturro plays my partner and alan cumming the deposed dictator general batista in one scene , we are in a windy havana square watching anthony lapaglia , as castro , give a speech we are hoping his hair will blow off , thanks to a depilatorylaced shampoo we 've sent him unfortunately , the shampoo has ended up in the hands , and hair , of sigourney as the wind picks up , her hair blows off at one point , i reacted by dropping my jaw in shock and got a mouthful of hair sigourney , a sublimely amusing person , said , did you ever think when you went to princeton that you 'd make your living getting hit with hair \? would n't she have been surprised if i had said , yes \? but looking back to my senior year , i could never have predicted any of the steps that had brought me to that moment princeton had been for me blissfully happy excluding the day they were out of hot dogs at lunch , i cannot recall a single unhappy moment there planning my future , i had a very clear idea of what i wanted to do , but a very blurry one of how to do it i knew i wanted to write and perform in my own films in the manner of my idol , woody allen but when i went , that once , to the career counseling center and faced the bulletin board , none of the cards said , needed writeractordirector for major feature , no experience required , must be willing to earn high salary facing my future , i was suddenly suffused with anxiety my goal was to maintain that heady mix of occasional intellectualism and constant silliness that was university life , but no job offered that the fear i felt made me so woozy that i decided not to ruin my year thinking about it i would not find a job the job would have to find me the miracle is it did the day before i graduated , my friend liz tirrell called from saturday night live and told me they were hiring writers she said i should submit sketches to the astonishment of all who read the material , myself most especially , i was hired at 850 a week it seemed too good to be true it was my year , 1980 , was viewed then and still as the worst year in the show s history , which is no small achievement when you think of some of the other years that season was full of tension , trauma , backbiting and , later , frontbiting the giddy fun i 'd hoped to recreate from college seemed a lifetime ago every monday we would pitch our sketches i dreaded these sessions , since i was nervous about how my ideas would be received but i was also eager to be there to hear the rivetingly bizarre ideas of a tall , sweet man who blinked a lot , as though something had just fallen out of the overhead bin and beaned him every sketch he pitched began like a nursery rhyme and ended like a letter from penthouse forum it s a sketch about a mommy and a daddy and a little girl , he said in a soft voice that recalled mr rogers they go to central park , and there is a water fountain and the mommy takes a drink , and she says 'mmmm , this water is good try some , daddy' so the daddy tries some , and he says 'mmmm , you 're right , mommy , this water is good try some , little suzy' and so little suzy stands on her tippy toes to get a sip , but before she does a big german shepherd bounces out of the bushes and rapes her ! in that room , after that pitch , you could have heard , as my father likes to say , a sock drop i was not surprised when this writer was fired writers were fired so often that my friend patty marx said it was as if we were in an agatha christie novel one day there were 17 writers , then 16 eventually , the producer was fired , then half the writers and cast then the writers guild went on strike and then , when the strike ended , as dame agatha had predicted , there were none snl started over without us
sydney , nova scotia alex morrison has seen horrifying things in his two decades in and around the cape breton mines but nothing spooked him more than watching the first freighter of imported coal dock here , right in the heart of canada s coal country i just stood there , mr morrison said he stared as though the ship were the flying dutchman itself , because like the phantom ship , the coal freighter was an omen of misfortune men have dug coal in this area for centuries but decades of patronage and mismanagement , and the unique difficulty of cutting coal from beneath the ocean floor , have made the cape breton mines among the most expensive to operate in north america the freighter scared mr morrison because it was a sign that it was cheaper for the local power company to burn imported coal from colombia than to use coal mined less than a mile away that was three years ago now , although regional power shortages are pushing up demand for coal across north america , the last of the fabled cape breton mines will close in the fall unable to find a buyer , the canadian government , which has poured more than 1 billion into the mines since nationalizing them in 1967 , has decided to let them go dark when the last whistle blows and men come out of the deeps for the last time , it will mark the end of a traumatic epoch that has shaped generations of mining families and left a complicated legacy on this lovely land the closing of the mines also underscores the powerful forces that are squeezing , and some say hardening , canada s heart the mines have become one of canada s most expensive and longlasting experiments , a monument to the socialiststyle government intervention that once characterized canada s more compassionate nature , valuing jobs over profits we were a fairly leftleaning government during the 60 s , 70 s and 80 s , said joe shannon , a trucking executive who serves as chairman of the cape breton development corporation , the government agency that runs the mines and is now overseeing their closing our priorities are different today a liberal party government took over the mines 34 years ago , and it is the liberal government of prime minister jean chr tien that is closing them by cutting wasteful programs and tightening government spending , mr chr tien has eliminated canada s huge budget deficit the government ca n't pick winners , said deputy industry minister v peter harder but losers pick government among the losers in this saga are the miners who live in glace bay , sydney mines , new waterford and other bluecollar towns along cape breton island s eastern coast more than 12 , 000 men once worked underground in dozens of mines now fewer than 500 work at the prince mine , the last one still operating middleaged , with paidoff mortgages and children headed for college , these men worry that they will have to leave the island to find work in the coal fields of alberta or the offshore rigs in newfoundland , if anyone is willing to take on their broken bones , weak eyes and weary backs jackie beaton does not even want to think about coming out of the ground that one last time i do n't know what i'm going to do honestly i do n't , he said as he settled into a favorite recliner , a guide to passing the high school equivalency test where he left it folded over the chair s arm the night before like many others , mr beaton , 47 , of new waterford , started in the mines after the 1973 arab oil embargo made coal an attractive alternative the provincially owned local utility then built two coalburning generating stations alongside new mines the mine company told us , 'when you get a job with us , boys , you 've got a job for life , ' he said we believed it his father and his grandfather had gone underground for the same steady paycheck nobody knows a miner who got rich working down below but men who risk their lives underground form a special bond all in all , it has been a good life , mr beaton said he is just disappointed that it has not worked out the way he planned his union is negotiating severance and early retirement , but the men doubt that they will be taken care of properly mr beaton does not hesitate to blame politicians for the fate of the mines it was politics that put the industry here , he said , and politics that took it from us actually it was a global struggle for power that initiated cape breton s centurieslong dalliance with coal sometime around 1720 , french soldiers chipped the first coal from waterfront outcroppings and used it to fire the forges at the fortress of louisbourg , france s naval stronghold in the new world by the 1890 s the dominion coal company had taken control of the mines production soared , and dominion s directors expanded into steel , which relied on a steady supply of coal and , in this case , substantial government subsidies at their peak , steel and coal combined employed 20 , 000 men here , making sydney an industrial powerhouse cape breton became a magnet for immigrants from the british isles and a hotbed of union organizers and labor strife a confrontation between miners and companyhired goon squads led to the death of a miner , william davis , on june 11 , 1925 since then , no cape breton miner has worked on june 11
cherry hill when patricia mccargo attended cherry hill high school in the early 1960 s , the complexion in the hallways was decidedly pale i seem to remember that there were only six africanamericans in our class , ms mccargo , who was one of those six , said of the approximately 800 students in the class of 1965 i do n't know if there was an africanamerican teacher , but you did n't see many black faces as you traveled the halls ms mccargo , who today is a liaison in the south jersey office of the governor , was quick to add on the other hand , i never felt discriminated against people were very nice it has always been a thoughtful community for that reason ms mccargo came back to cherry hill to live and has had four children go through the public school system here , where the black population has risen to about 8 percent of the township s 60 , 000 residents which is reflected in the school population as well yet the state department of education insists that cherry hill is out of compliance in how its gradeschool population is racially apportioned though not by much , every three years , each school district in the state is required to submit a survey , called a multiyear equity plan , to the education department when cherry hill submitted its blueprint last year for the academic years 20002001 through 20022003 , the department contended the district fell short in its effort to have a school population that approximated the number of white , black , hispanic and asian students in the township in the case of cherry hill , the district is 8036 percent white , so each school is required to have a student population that is from 7741 to 8331 percent white usually , this is not an issue in the upper grades , since most school districts in the state have only one high school and many have only one middle school in fact , cherry hill , one of the larger districts in the state with nearly 11 , 000 students , is in compliance in its two high schools and three middle schools but when the state looked more closely at the 12 elementary schools here , it found them all out of compliance though none by very much at the woodcrest school , for instance , the one deviating most from the guidelines , only 31 students of nearly 400 would have to be moved in the five other schools , the numbers were off by fewer than six students i think this is a little outofwhack , said state senator john adler , a democrat from camden county we 're talking about maybe one family moving in or out of a school , and for this , cherry hill seems to be being picked on when it has long been trying to do all sorts of things to achieve racial balance in the community few people are more dismayed by the state s position than ms mccargo , who is cochairwoman of the district s minority achievement committee sure , certainly the racial makeup of the district could be more balanced , she said but in general , i think this is place that listens but the state contends that no matter what ms mccargo or superintendent morton sherman say , these imbalances no matter how small adversely affect the education of all students , white and black in its letter to cherry hill informing the district that it was out of compliance , the department pointed to four other districts teaneck , morris , montclair and piscataway as examples of large , multiethnic districts that had done well over the years in providing equity in the schools cherry hill residents have long considered themselves progressive , but the notion of moving children from a neighborhood elementary school to one farther away to achieve racial balance is another matter at community meetings this the winter , parents pleaded with school administrators not to change the geographic boundaries of their schools and to come up with another way to comply with the state s desegregation plans but the state which cited no other school district this year insisted that its guidelines be met despite the state s insistence , the law is somewhat vague when it comes to enforcement the state can either withhold funds or seek redress in the courts in the most extreme cases , it can even decertify a district but in almost 50 years of desgregation in the nation schools , the state says none of these measures have ever had to be taken cherry hill should be an example , a shining beacon , on racial equity and , sadly , it is not , said marcellus smith jr , a specialist in equal educational opportunity for the state department of education they have no lack of money , of resources , of opportunities there is no excuse and yet they are not complying with the simplest of directives that would aid racial equity in the district , and that is to balance school populations cherry hill is situated between camden , whose school district is nearly entirely black and hispanic , and haddonfield , which is almost completely white but because the state s desegregation formulas are based on the number minority students within only that district , camden and haddonfield are easily in compliance
fort worth , oct 28 to some of his colleagues at the lockheed martin corporation , charles thomas burbage seems to have come right out of the pages of the right stuff , tom wolfe s homage to the test pilots who broke the sound barrier and took the united states into space mr burbage , after all , used to push navy fighter jets to the limit just to see how much stress they could take as they landed on a swaying , sleetencrusted aircraft carrier and the tall and trim mr burbage , 54 , is still striking enough to turn heads as he confidently walked though the lobby of the worthington hotel here for an interview what really makes him a hero these days at lockheed martin , though , is his leading role in snaring the richest prize ever awarded by the pentagon with a 19 billion down payment to oversee the development of the next generation of combat fighter jets in a project expected to total more than 200 billion in the next four decades mr burbage , director of lockheed s joint strike fighter program , has become one of the most important executives to watch among military suppliers today and with good reason the pentagon has finally cast aside its failure four decades ago to develop a single plane to serve different roles for the military branches , and it is counting on mr burbage and lockheed to produce 3 , 000 or more costeffective , workhorse fighters for the navy , marines and air force based on a common design he is a rising star , said vance coffman , lockheed s chief executive we wanted tom s leadership needed it may be more to the point only a year ago , mr burbage a 21year lockheed veteran whose father was a career navy pilot who survived the japanese attack on pearl harbor was asked to take over the fouryearold joint strike fighter project for lockheed they asked me to go over to jsf and make sure we won , mr burbage said matter of factly over the clatter of breakfast dishes being washed in the kitchen of the worthington s cafe last year , as the deadline approached , lockheed executives suspected that they had trumped their competitor , the boeing company , on the jet s design but the overall management of the lockheed project was foundering , a notion since reinforced in interviews with boeing and lockheed executives as well as pentagon officials since the decision was announced on friday enter mr burbage a graduate of the naval academy in annapolis , he not only served as a navy officer for 10 years but also worked at lockheed s corporate offices in washington there he made a considerable number of contacts among important lawmakers on capitol hill and at the pentagon and mr burbage already got along well with procurement officials at the air force , including darleen a druyun , its toughminded chief of acquisition he worked closely with her on lockheed s f22 fighter jet program in the mid1990 s since starting the job , mr burbage has spent barely two weeks in the tiny apartment he keeps in fort worth , where the joint strike fighter will be built i'm either always in washington or on international travel , mr burbage said i'm just not here that much what distinguishes mr burbage , though , from the typical fighter jock or military executive is a kind of new economy sensibility he brings to an industry defined by a molasseslike pace of change and an unyielding hierarchy that mirrors the military itself mr burbage has taken to calling a trio of particularly bright executives on the joint strike fighter team the wizards despite their eye rolling and shoulder shrugging they have n't accepted me calling them the wizards yet , mr burbage said with a laugh we told them we were going to put all their offices together and call it oz that s kind of foreign it s foreign to this business you do n't know if you should talk about it , but that is the image you want to project on the evening of oct 16 , 10 days before the pentagon planned to announce the fighter contract winner , mr burbage gathered from around the world more than 80 project leaders for lockheed and its key partners , northrop and bae systems before a twoday management retreat , he wanted his team to relax at a mexican restaurant near fort worth s stockyards but he also invited representatives from the air force , a break with tradition that sent shivers down the spines of some executives , he said , who did not want to bare their souls in front of the customer after dinner , mr burbage pulled out an oversize mock cover of fast company , a newera management magazine favored mostly by young hightechnology executives dated january 2005 and adorned with photographs of the three versions of the plane , the cover s main headline read , the joint strike fighter program takes off there were other headlines , too , including how did they do it \? and stock market defense is in mr burbage said he was trying to get the team leaders to consider the project s legacy and their role in it what would such an article say , mr burbage asked them how would it be written \? what did they want to be remembered for \? his openness is refreshing in the defense industry , said byron callan , a merrill lynch aerospace analyst

if i had to name my favorite shows of the new york season so far , the treasury of basel cathedral at the metropolitan museum of art would come high on a short list its jewelembellished gold and silver objects exist on some exotic outer fringe of beauty , where the crass and the ineffable meet together they have a cliffhanger of a tale to tell , as frustrating as it is uplifting there is the rarity factor almost none of the 75 works on view have visited the united states before and i ca n't remember the last time i experienced anything quite like their singleminded incandescence in a local museum basel itself is a prosaic place like many swiss cities , it has kept only a few traces of its past in the old part of town , twisty streets adhere to roman patterns , and the cathedral still stands , squat and brown , on its bluff over the rhine but only the river , sweeping through at a startling speed , suggests the glamour and panic of history in the late middle ages , the city was a magnet for scholars erasmus lived there its bishops were powerful , its churches rich in art with the reformation , fortunes changed on the night of feb 9 , 1529 , an antipapist crowd broke into the cathedral , smashing windows , defacing sculptures and consigning altarpieces to the flames through all of this the treasury sat , undisturbed , inside a closed cupboardlike alcove above the sacristy , and there it stayed for another 300 years then , in the 1830 s , in a dispute over the distribution of canton assets , the objects were removed from storage and put up for auction city officials , hoping to hold on to certain works , notably the great 11thcentury golden altar frontal , a monument of ottonian art , planted an agent at the auction but he made a stupefying blunder assuming that a fellow citizen was also bidding on the city s behalf , he withdrew from the competition at the last minute the other bidder , it turned out , was buying for himself , and got the altar frontal at a bargain price by the end of the day the greater part of one of the outstanding intact ensembles of medieval liturgical art had been dispersed the met show , a collaboration with the historisches museum basel , is an effort to reverse fate by reassembling as much of the treasury as possible many of the pieces on view are from the historisches museum itself , others from international institutions some 15 works have yet to be located two are known to have been destroyed the altar frontal , now in paris , has not traveled to new york and will not go to basel when the exhibition appears there this summer \( a modern cast of it , however , is on display \) but what is missing almost does n't matter , given the extraordinary things on view the show , organized by timothy b husband , curator of the department of medieval art at the met and of the cloisters , opens with evocative introductory material , including a model of the cathedral interior indicating where the treasury was stored and how , for a few days each year , it was displayed on the high altar before being put away again this scene setting is done on a miniature scale but just around the corner are the 15thcentury cupboard doors themselves , looking big , blond and lemon pledged , surrounded by things they once protected these include liturgical hardware a soupbowlsize gold chalice , a set of decoish altar cruets , a pair of silver censers in the shape of romanesque churches but the most arresting items are the reliquaries , which make up the bulk of the show they come in various forms and types some are elaborate crucifixes in which relics a fragment of a saint s bone , say , or a splinter from the true cross were housed in the intensely ornate gildedsilver piece known as the sunday cross , the relics are placed behind thick orbs of rock crystal , which seem like magnifying lenses for a mulchy , organic world other reliquaries are architectural a 14thcentury casket covered with silver plaques has a peaked roof and double doors that afford a view into an interior painted midnight blue and adorned with gilded stars , like a night sky also on hand is a group of astonishingly tall , futuristiclooking objects known as tower monstrances with their clear glass display cylinders surmounted by forests of gothic spires , they seem poised for liftoff finally , there are containers that imitate the pieces of anatomy they were often meant to hold a reliquary of st walpert , on loan from the state hermitage museum in st petersburg , russia , takes the form of an upright hand and arm another that once enshrined the remains of one of the holy innocents is a gemstudded sandal with neat silver toes poking out most engaging of all are reliquary busts although designed as repositories for skulls , they are full of sculptural life st thecla , as portrayed in her bust , has thick girlish plaits and a quizzical tilt to her face st ursula , lofty of brow , steady of gaze and with a slight overbite , is both goodnatured and wise for some viewers , the whole idea of relics may seem strange , even ghoulish to them the basel objects probably make most sense as extravagant collectibles , a species of jumbo jewelry , and that is not wrong ostentatiously precious , they were made to adorn things , not least the reputations of their donors and in them , as in all art , conflicting impulses are at work politics and entertainment , personal devotion and personal gain but anyone attuned to world religions or to popular culture will find the relic concept familiar it was a crucial component of ancient buddhism and is a dynamic part of christianity today , even in new york in a washington heights church the body of the roman catholic saint frances cabrini , called the patron of immigrants , is on permanent view in a glass coffin her muchrevered shrine is a short walk from the cloisters , which has medieval reliquaries in its collection this phenomenon has countless secular extensions what are pilgrimage sites like graceland in memphis , with its elvis memorabilia , or objectoriented devotional events like the jacqueline kennedy onassis auction at sotheby s if not contemporary examples of a relic cult in action \? but a knowledge of social history , however fascinating , is not a prerequisite for being swept away by a show as visually enchanting as this one few of the object types included are unique you can find their equivalents in many museums but the basel examples push craftsmanship and formal invention to a pitch of delirium that makes other versions look merely generic at least a few of the treasury objects are beyond compare one is a pastiche figure of king david with a 13thcentury body of rhenish silver and an antique cameo of a gorgon s face for a head it is strictly one of a kind another is a 15thcentury reliquary statuette of st christopher shown fording a swift , seething river with the infant jesus on his shoulders the workmanship is flawless , the naturalism as easy as a breath the mix of fear and dawning wonder on the saint s face has the soft , homely luster of light coming through a halfopen door the treasury of basel cathedral remains at the metropolitan museum of art , fifth avenue at 82nd street , manhattan , \( 212 \) 5357710 , through may 27 photo a 14thcentury silver reliquary bust

at 5 30 pm last tuesday , in a large open space called the living room at st peter s lutheran church in midtown manhattan , 110 hivpositive adults and their children gathered for a free meal that is offered there once a week as the families , most of them from brooklyn , the bronx and queens , ate chicken parmigiana , yellow rice , brussels sprouts and toasted garlic bread from paper plates , they talked and joked with one another and with social workers for the agency that provides the meal , the momentum aids project among those dining in the noisy room was rhonda t , a 35yearold woman who spent five years as a prostitute while she was addicted to crack and other drugs , and her three children , two boys ages 14 and 7 , and a 12yearold girl she requested that her last name and the names of her children be withheld so the children would not be teased at school rhonda said she made the hourlong journey from her home in cambria heights , queens , to the church because it s kind of good to be around people who are positive , meaning hiv positive i can see that my problems are not that bad , she said for rhonda , meals are a chance to put things in perspective and get help from staff social workers for her children , they are a way to stay fed asked about what she keeps stocked in her kitchen , rhonda said , we literally do n't have food she lives with her husband , a maintenance worker for the new york city housing authority , her three children and two children of his the family survives on the husband s 874 monthly net salary , 851 a month in rent assistance from the new york city human resources administration s division of aids services and income support , and 6 a month in food stamps rhonda , a straighta student when she was growing up in fort greene , brooklyn , is now paying a heavy price for the years from 1989 to 1994 that she spent on the streets of fort greene , addicted to drugs and alcohol besides hiv , she is also battling hepatitis c and precancerous cells in her cervix , said a spokeswoman for the long island college hospital in brooklyn , where she is being treated i came here from a really dirty place , rhonda said i used to be 95 pounds soaking wet out there , smoking crack each year since 1996 , rhonda said , she has undergone two operations to remove precancerous cells after each operation , she has had an extended stay in the hospital i really wish that i could work and earn that extra income , but because of that , i ca n't , she said i 'd be gone too much aside from medications , a good diet is the best way to combat aids , said edwin krales , coordinator of nutrition and outreach for momentum the momentum project provides one or two warm meals a day to aids patients and people who are hiv positive but do not yet have aids many of them are homeless , and more than 90 percent of them live below the poverty line many of our clients have never seen a meal that did n't come out of a paper bag with a toy in it , mr krales said in an effort to reach more lowincome hivpositive adults , the federation of protestant welfare agencies , one of the seven local charities supported by the new york times neediest cases fund , gave 10 , 000 to the momentum aids project in each of the last two years , so that the project could give clients subway tokens at their meals that would get them home and encourage them to return the project helps many of those who come to eat get better housing , eyeglasses , drug treatment , better access to health care and entitlements for which they may not know they are eligible rhonda contracted hiv during the years she was prostituting herself to pay for crack when i found out i was n't too shocked or anything , she said , recalling that it was two years later , after she was off drugs , that the realization hit her none of her children have hiv after finishing their meal , rhonda and her children took home three plastic bags of food potatoes , carrots and bananas she said that because she could not work , the family had trouble making ends meet she said that by the end of the month , the family would owe as much as 3 , 000 in rent and bills my lights are off , my phone is off , she said we 're about to be evicted rhonda said that she was worried about her financial troubles , but that she had already overcome greater challenges in her life , such as simply keeping healthy each day so that her overall health does not decline but she said she was resigned to the fact that she has a terminal illness everyone s going to die , she said this is just my road i made a mistake and now i'm living with it how to help checks payable to the new york times neediest cases fund should be sent to po box 5193 , general post office , new york , ny 10087 , or any of

bellingham , wash , feb 28 in what could be viewed as a bit of luck for riot and rainplagued seattle , the puget sound region emerged from a magnitude 68 earthquake today relatively unscathed scientists say the relative lack of damage from this powerful quake came , in large part , because it originated so deep within the earth some 30 miles beneath the surface , 40 miles southwest of seattle researchers say today s type of quake , a slab , or benioff zone , earthquake , is the most frequent and potentially most benign of the types of earthquake in the region this is the earthquake we 've been expecting , said dr craig weaver , regional coordinator for the united states geological survey earthquake program in the 1900 s we 've had a lot of these and we 're going to have more dr weaver said the survey deployed teams of researchers immediately after the quake , looking for landslides and earth movement from a chartered plane as well as looking for effects of the quake from the ground scientists said the quake originated very close to a similarsize earthquake in 1949 which did much more damage , at least in part , because buildings then had not been built to be as resistant to earthquakes scientists emphasized that today s quake , centered roughly beneath the delta of the nisqually river between tacoma and olympia , should not be a sign that the region is off the hook , as they said slab earthquakes remain as likely tomorrow as they were yesterday and they note that other types of earthquakes , generated offshore or in shallow faults like the one lying directly beneath seattle , that are sure to visit the region will very likely be more damaging we certainly hope that this does n't lull people into a false sense of security , said dr thomas pratt , geophysicist with the united states geological survey seismologists said the earthquake originated in the juan de fuca plate , an oceanic plate that dives below the north american continental plate offshore and continues to slide beneath the plate farther inland these slab earthquakes originate within a plate , or slab , that is sliding beneath another scientists said such potent slab earthquakes have occurred in the region every 35 years on average the last one , with a magnitude 65 , occurred in 1965 in anticipation of what scientists knew was the next big slab earthquake to come , researchers were planning to gather next month in seattle to , among other things , get ready to put out some earthquakemeasuring instruments the earthquake came too early , said william steele , seismology laboratory coordinator at the university of washington , or maybe the meeting came too late while the quake originated within the juan de fuca plate itself , the pacific northwest faces two other distinct seismic hazards , said dr james dolan , a professor of earth sciences at the university of southern california it can also experience relatively shallow earthquakes along faults , like the seattle fault , and huge earthquakes along the fault between the juan de fuca plate and the continental plate dr stephen kirby , geophysicist with the united states geological survey in menlo park , calif , and a specialist in slab earthquakes , said these deep earthquakes are particularly inaccessible and difficult to study and there remain competing hypotheses as to how they are generated he said the leading theory suggests that a slab slides underneath another plate , heats up and releases water the water creates pressure and eventually ruptures that generate earthquakes today s earthquake did not produce nearly as much damage as two recent comparable events in japan and california the magnitude 69 kobe earthquake killed several thousand people in 1995 and the magnitude 67 quake in the northridge section of los angeles generated 50 billion in damage in 1994 the reason is the relative depth of the quakes , he said today s epicenter was some 35 miles deep , whereas the other two quakes occurred just a few miles from the surface scientists said while with some kinds of quakes aftershocks are typical , there were no aftershocks from today s quake and none are expected , as is typical of slab earthquakes loma prieta had something like 7 , 000 total aftershocks in the first year or so , and in the first day there were hundreds and hundreds , said dr kirby , referring to the 1989 quake that occurred south of the san francisco bay area we do n't know why there s this difference dr pratt said he and fellow earthquake researchers ran out of their buildings when the quake began this morning but rushed back in to check their instruments as soon as the shaking stopped and found that for many of their instruments , the quake had been off the charts the needles had started banging the sides of the instrument on the edges of the paper , said dr pratt , which is a very impressive looking sight for decades , seismologists concerned about west coast earthquake risk had focused on california , where the san andreas fault threatens san francisco and los angeles but starting about a decade ago , geologists discovered striking evidence that a fault zone off the coast of the pacific northwest posed substantial earthquake risk dr thomas heaton , a seismologist at the united states geological survey called the zone the most dangerous fault in the united states , excluding alaska in recent years , scientists have gathered increasing evidence of the danger of the seattle fault zone as a result , scientists have begun to recognize the puget sound region as a region of many , potentially huge , seismic hazards there has also a big effort on the part of local governments to improve earthquake preparedness , said dr kirby , including improved zoning , seismic hazard maps and better building codes dr weaver said he hoped residents would take this quake to heart this was a good warning , he said this is earthquake country chart a deep earth tremor an earthquake with magnitude 68 shook the seattle area yesterday its focus point , or hypocenter , was 33 miles below the surface , along the boundary of the oceanic juan de fuca tectonic plate and the continental north american plate the epicenter is the surface location directly above the hypocenter , the focus point of an earthquake map of north america highlighting areas of significant

cairo , dec 13 arab leaders today renewed their demands for an international force to protect palestinians and their institutions from renewed israeli bombardment , warning that the violence may spin out of control with or without yasir arafat the egyptian foreign minister , ahmed maher , said israel s decision to cut ties with the palestinian leader signaled that it had chosen aggression over negotiations i hope now that the world realizes that it is time to step in very strongly against the policies of the israeli government , mr maher said it is only through negotiations with the elected leader of the palestinian people that there could be security , not by trying to weaken him arab leaders have repeatedly warned that a failure to resolve the palestinianisraeli conflict could ultimately lead to a wider regional conflict but none would seem to be in a position to go to war , if for no other reason than to avoid antagonizing the united states and europe two of israel s neighbors , egypt and jordan , have signed peace treaties and depend on american aid lebanon and syria , which also border israel , are in deep economic trouble and have been trying to attract european aid and investment in general , arab officials seemed at a loss about what they could do other than plead for help from beyond the middle east amr moussa , the general secretary of the arab league , said a working group on the palestinian conflict would meet in early january he also called for an urgent meeting of the united nations security council , saying he had been telephoning mr arafat , arab foreign ministers and european union officials all day to discuss the latest israeli attacks but mr moussa , clearly angry , called on the united states to intervene and salvage the peace process the united states must decide on the ways to save their peace efforts , if they have the will , he said neither syria nor the persian gulf states , which have had the rockiest relationships with mr arafat , publicly commented on his predicament others expressed concern that the israeli prime minister , ariel sharon , may want to destroy the palestinian authority and its institutions , which represent the palestinians' hopes for a state of their own i do n't think sharon will get rid of the palestinian authority , said taher elmasri , a former jordanian foreign minister whose family had been prominent west bank landowners for years this is still a red line for every international group but will he get rid of arafat \? maybe mr arafat himself is far from popular with his fellow arab leaders , who refer to him in private as a volatile man who has a tendency to choose the right stand but at the wrong time but they have also watched in alarm as militant groups like hamas and islamic jihad have grown more defiant during the past year s uprising against israeli occupation so they have rallied around mr arafat as an essential moderate counterweight to the fundamentalists in an interview published today , king abdullah of jordan said he worried that hamas has cast itself as a political alternative to mr arafat and the palestinian authority i am very concerned that these developments will push the situation into a civil war on the west bank and gaza , the king said in the past when fighting became intense , thousands of palestinians fled from the west bank into jordan , where at least half the population is of palestinian origin if another exodus begins , king abdullah told the newspaper asharq al awsat , jordan would close the bridges that span the jordan river much of the arab media has cast the israeli actions of the past week as a personal settling of scores by mr sharon , who directed the israeli invasion of lebanon in 1982 that led to mr arafat s expulsion to tunisia in an interview published today in the kuwaiti newspaper al rai al a'am , mr arafat also called it a personal battle between old foes he tried to expel me from beirut , and here i am back in gaza , ramallah , nablus , hebron and all the west bank , mr arafat said sharon either forgets history easily or he never learns from it

chingola , zambia if copper is what keeps businessmen busy here , then golf is what keeps them happy , and until recently , no one here was very busy or very happy , and most definitely not at the nchanga golf club long the social center of this mining town , the club was where deals were sealed over porterhouse steaks and friendships were struck on fairways that count cobras among the hazards little more than two decades ago , golf digest ranked nchanga 14th in an article rating the 50 finest courses outside the united states , one spot ahead of the walton heath golf club in surrey , england a laminated , yellowing copy of the september 1979 article still hangs on a wall near the bar you have never heard of it , the survey says of nchanga sadly , few can ever see it , for this jungle course built by copper miners is rated by bobby locke as the finest course south of the equator and then the copper industry , the lifeblood of this poor country s economy , began to crumble depressed prices worldwide and inadequate investment at home devastated the entire country , particularly big mining centers like chingola , situated just south of the congo , along the string of central zambian cities that form the country s copper belt so now , as the recently privatized copper mines begin to claw their way back toward efficiency and profitability , few places , outside the huge mines themselves , reflect the changing fortunes of this town better than this faded golf club caddies long left idling beside blank scoreboards and cooks left standing over cold stoves are busy again , catering to the weekend corporate tournaments and midweek business lunches that in recent years have been all too rare here they are playing , and they are giving us money , said christopher majuda , 23 , who started caddying when he was still in grade school now we can afford a bag of mealie meal , he said referring to corn meal , a staple in the region indeed for people like mr majuda , much more is at stake than the profits of the konkola copper mines , the local company set up last year by anglo american plc to manage its newly acquired operations in zambia the young caddie is one of the thousands of people who depend in one way or another on the mines if the mines fail , the foreign businessmen can depart , disappointed but otherwise none the worse the ordinary people of chingola cannot , and the last few years have given them a hint of the hardship that would almost certainly settle over the town things were really bad , webby musonda , 26 , who has caddied on and off since he was about 11 years old , said as he and several of his colleagues waited by the scoreboard for arriving players during the lean years , caddies who were accustomed to working once or twice a day were lucky to be caddying once or twice a week , mr musonda said earning only 4 , 000 kwacha a round , or about 143 , plus the occasional tip , meant that men often had to look for other ways to make money in a town where nearly everyone was struggling to subsist once the british colony of northern rhodesia , zambia was one of the first countries in the region to achieve independence , and the whitecontrolled copper industry was an early target of the new black government the mines were nationalized in the late 1960 s , but by the 1990 s , the mines had fallen into horrible disrepair , after years of insufficient capital investment , inefficient production and overstaffing no one here is under the illusion that nchanga will soon rejoin the ranks of the world s finest golf courses or that the country s mining industry will return to its heyday , when it was the world s thirdbiggest miner of copper yet they are optimistic we 're beginning to see daylight , said margaret allan , who has worked at the club for 40 years and now runs the restaurant everything was just in limbo now we 're looking forward , not to boom times , but for things to improve the trunk full of groceries that she and her staff were unloading as she talked was evidence , she said , of the trickledown effect of the new investment in the copper industry , benefiting not only her restaurant , but the supermarket , too it s a whole spinoff , the club s competition secretary , gary chadwick , said everyone is getting involved , and everyone is happy lunch hour at the club is bustling again even breakfast and dinner are busy , as new employees waiting for housing to open up and families to arrive opt to take their meals at the club around town , new guest houses are springing up and old homes are being renovated and with the arrival of new executives and managers , stalwarts like paul speedie are having far less trouble fielding foursomes we 've found a lot of these konkola copper guys are keen golfers , mr speedie said as he made his way to the seventh hole during a recent sunday afternoon tournament sponsored by sulzer south africa , the regional subsidiary of the swiss industrial machinery concern mr speedie , the regional service manager for komatsu mining systems , an international manufacturer of heavy machinery , is an avid golfer during the slump of the last several years , he kept swinging , hoping that interest would pick up now that it has , he knows that it is not just about golf everyone s outlook , particularly the white people who 've lived here all their lives , is a lot more optimistic , he said people are more cheerful they seem to see the light at the end of the tunnel and indeed the club is steadily recapturing its singular place at the nexus of the town s social and business lives , as novices like dr sixtus c mulenga take up the game a squash player by choice , dr mulenga , konkola copper s vice president for safety and health , has become a golfer by necessity anyone who doubts big changes are afoot in chingola , dr mulenga said , need look no farther than his own presence at nchanga look at me , he said cheerfully as he marched toward the sixth hole i'm playing golf photo paul speedie of komatsu mining systems tees off at the nchanga club in zambia , where both golf and copper mining are making

this is one of those nevertoldbefore stories , the result of rummaging through newly discovered archives present events in new york make it timely one night in 1936 , cole porter walked up to a table at the stork club and threw a batch of worthless goldmine stocks in george gershwin s face during the depression , that was a way for popular entertainers to show a lack of respect for one another \( the elegant word dis had not yet been coined \) they would take certificates of stocks that had lost their value in the 1929 crash and hurl them at a person deemed deserving of insult few outsiders knew this , but porter liked close friends to call him l l cole j it seems violence bubbled just beneath the surface of this man who , in public , cultivated an urbane manner and a flair for lyrics that were delightful , delicious and delovely he was way ahead of his time take his use of english fragments like de years later , hiphop artists honored him by taking strange names themselves and twisting da language into new shapes gershwin , known in his own circle as dr g , was also fascinated with new musical forms you remember his rapsody in blue that s what he wanted to call it , but his conservative publisher made him spell it the conventional way in 1936 , dr g and his brother ira \( the notorious ira \) wrote a number called by strauss , which poked fun at rival songwriters it began away with the music of broadway , be off with your irving berlin oh , i 'd give no quarter to kern or cole porter , and gershwin keeps pounding on tin how can i be civil when hearing this drivel \? it seemed innocent enough dr g had even mocked himself but l l cole j took offense those were days of nasty feuds in the music world to add to the menace , entertainers like the singer ruth etting had close ties to gangsters , as the word was then spelled \( the more sophisticated gangstas having yet to arrive \) when l l cole j saw dr g at the stork club with his entourage , he could not contain himself he walked right up to dr g with him was his frequent companion , the musical star irene bordoni , referred to in the tabloids of the day as i bor without a word , l l cole j hurled the stock certificates in dr g s face dr g was enraged you whiffenpoof , he snarled this was a serious insult to show he was down with the common man , l l cole j was softpedaling his privileged background he wanted to erase all memory of a group he had formed years earlier , ywa , which stood for yalies with attitude what happened next became the stuff of legends shots , as they say , rang out three or four people were hit none were really famous , although the wounded did include a talented porter prot g named sidney shacur , a heavy smoker nicknamed twopack shacur with i bor right behind , l l cole j ran out of the nightclub , and jumped into his vintage stutz bearcat he zoomed along midtown streets , running several red lights , until the police caught up with him they found a gun under the front seat l l cole j denied that this gat \( to use the quaint parlance of the day \) was his but others insisted that they had seen a gun tucked in his belt at the stork club and so he was put on trial in the end , he was acquitted he continued to write hits , and even evoked his tangle with the law by calling one of his songs why ca n't you behave \? the truth was that he could be unpredictably explosive friends never forgot his fierce battles with the composer harold arlen def hal who wrote a song called let s fall in love well , those very words formed the refrain of an l l cole j hit from a few years earlier , a number that went by the title let s do it nothing enraged l l cole j more than the thought of being ripped off one night , the two songwriters got it on at el morocco there was a lot of shoving , with threats and awful names exchanged but at least there was no gunplay that time we raise all this now in case you 've wondered why modern celebrities like puffy combs , lil' kim and foxy brown behave the way they do now you know they are just following in the footsteps of giants you did n't think these dim bulbs could invent this stuff on their own , did you \? of course , there was history even before dr g and l l cole j remind us sometime to tell you what antonio salieri did to w a mozart , known in the imperial court as snoop wolfy wolf
thirtynine years ago , the sanctuary of the judson memorial church on washington square became the site of a landmark development in the international history of dance it housed the doings of a motley band of folks in their early 20 s for whom historymaking was of no concern they were simply searching for personal paths to artistic creation through bodily movement they became known as the judson dance theater , and what they did shocked the dance establishment ultimately , however , the impact of their discoveries forced it to move over and make room for them most of the original group had classical ballet or moderndance training or both before they got to judson , and some had studied choreography with establishment teachers , but their skills varied widely what they had in common was a class in choreography taught at merce cunningham s studio , housed at the time in a drab old building at the corner of 14th street and sixth avenue the teacher was robert dunn , a musician and disciple of john cage , the avantgarde composer and music director of cunningham s dance company dunn s job was to encourage the creation of dances following the farout methods cage had adopted for his musicmaking exactly how many choreographic aspirants had works performed at judson during the six years of performances that began on july 6 , 1962 , may be something no one will ever know , given the informality that prevailed and the rate at which participants came and went but it was the originators who set the pace and tone and ended up making the most forceful impression worldwide over the years , they have racked up an extraordinary record of dance works commissioned , films made , books written , operas and other theater works directed , prizes and awards received \( including nine guggenheim and two macarthur fellowships \) and myriad honors for artistic achievement here and abroad mikhail baryshnikov , a dazzling classical ballet dancer when he came here from the soviet union in 1974 , quickly became attracted to american modern dance and appeared often with various modern companies , but the judson days had long since ended then , in april 1999 , he saw some of the original works in revivals at a benefit for judson memorial church and was intrigued he called david gordon , a friend and judsonite he knew from a previous association at american ballet theater , and suggested their collaboration on a survey for mr baryshnikov s white oak project the result had its debut in princeton last october and has since been seen in a number of cities on its way to new york beginning tuesday through saturday at the brooklyn academy of music , mr baryshnikov and the white oak project will honor seven of what are now called the postmoderns with pastforward , a celebration of 15 of their works dating from the early days as well as more recent times on thursday , some , perhaps all , of the choreographers will appear as performers following are eight recollections of the judson dance theater and its beginnings , excerpted from interviews seven are by the choreographers included in the pastforward programs that of the lighting designer jennifer tipton tells of a dancer devoted to the cause whose appearance in the very first performance at judson remains fixed in memory steve paxton yvonne rainer and i had the first meeting with al carmines , one of the pastors at judson , to ask if we could perform at the church , and then we had to have a showing for him i ca n't remember what was shown , but yvonne and i were not alone ruth emerson did something , and bob dunn was there whatever it was , i honestly think carmines thought it was all so dumb , he could n't say no in something he wrote later , he stated that only after seeing the early performances did he begin to feel that something interesting was going on there was n't a big desire to shock we were simply looking forward to having a small showing of our work in a friendly church in greenwich village it was n't a big gesture we were making we were investigating something very seriously of course , art does have the ability to surprise occasionally , and that period for us was one of casually taking enormous aesthetic steps judson was a place not to mimic one s peers , but when something interested everyone at once , it became almost inevitable i'm thinking particularly of our focus on pedestrian movement and our continuing fascination with it ideas for dance do occasionally bubble up in the culture and some people become available to explore the bubbles that s what was happening then yvonne rainer i think it was my idea to inquire at judson because i had already been to its art gallery to see works by allan kaprow , i think , and perhaps claes oldenburg , and i had attended the poet s theater for joel oppenheimer s american dream so i knew that judson was interested in the cutting edge in experimental arts everything was free we paid no rent , and no tickets were sold the program decisions were made collectively , and i remember heated discussions about them when we started out , none of us were prepared to sustain a whole evening , but together we seemed to have an overabundance of material bob dunn , acting as a sort of moderator , was reluctant to eliminate anything , and that first night turned into a threehour marathon my works were a solo called ordinary dance , in which i spoke and moved at the same time , and dance for 3 people and 6 arms , which i performed with two other dancers
opinion polls , confusing computers , bitter partisanship , crass commercialism and the occasional disputed election are all part of the american scene in the early 21st century why should college football be any different \? it is n't the sport reflected the general culture like a funhouse mirror yesterday when the bowl championship series chose nebraska to play miami in the rose bowl for the national championship on jan 3 there was no tournament the hurricanes went undefeated this season and almost everyone agrees they deserve a berth in the title game but the cornhuskers have not played since the day after thanksgiving , when they lost to colorado , 6236 the victorious buffaloes went on to win the big 12 conference championship although nebraska was ranked second in the country in the bcs , oregon finished second behind miami in the coaches and news media polls , which make up 25 percent of the bcs formula colorado finished third in the polls nebraska was fourth but once the computers were added to the equation , nebraska moved up to second in the total bcs evaluation , while colorado finished third and oregon fourth colorado and oregon are therefore sentenced to meet in the fiesta bowl while nebraska goes to the rose bowl supporters of colorado and oregon , obviously , are not happy i understand that frustration , said john swofford , commissioner of the atlantic coast conference and coordinator of the bcs i'm sure i would feel the same way you 've got three , four , maybe five teams who feel they 're as good as anybody and deserve to play would it be nicer if everything was simpler and everyone agreed \? yes when someone asked whether the perception of chaos is good for the sport , swofford replied , it depends on what you consider chaos one factor in the confusion is a bcs element called strength of schedule it can make all the difference for instance because texas christian beat southern mississippi , 1412 , on saturday , it helped increase nebraska s strength of schedule because nebraska beat tcu in august that moved nebraska from 18th to 14th in strength of schedule , perhaps accounting for the 05 margin over colorado is that clear \? if not , please contact knute rockne on a ouija board the results were announced on national television in midafternoon during a show sponsored by a company that makes salty snack food the host of the show kept mentioning the communications company that sponsors the rose bowl and the retail chain that sponsors the trophy all the telecast needed was vanna white turning over the cards and regis philbin asking , is that your final answer \? the show included a split screen displaying gary barnett , the coach of colorado , and frank solich , the coach of nebraska , the way cable news channels show opposing politicians and pundits during the evening shoutouts barnett s frown trumped solich s placid demeanor barnett insisted that his team played more contending teams than solich s solich declined to point out that barnett s team lost more games , but he did say , you 're going to have controversy under a system like this we won 11 games in a row , solich said we 're very proud nebraska finished 111 colorado was 102 miami was 110 barnett s buffaloes almost qualified thanks to a big assist from his fellow coaches , who tried to run an endaround past the computers and perform some rough justice yesterday morning by changing their votes from last week the coaches moved colorado ahead of nebraska , flipping the third and fourth places despite the fact that neither team played , colorado got better in the opinion of the coaches and nebraska got worse but various computed components , including the strength of the respective schedules , left colorado in third place in the bcs , slightly behind nebraska this computer factor amounts to revenge of the nerds , the triumph of the guys from the high school math club who could not get the attention of the girls watching football practice cynical people may suggest that the bcs , in its fourth year , is a convenient arrangement among six major conferences to control the millions of dollars paid by the four major bowl games and their television sponsors there were even murmurs of antitrust challenges last week from brigham young , grumbles that lessened when byu ruined its perfect record by losing in hawaii on saturday , 7245 skeptics may also suggest that some of the studentathletes are not enrolled at their institutions of higher learning primarily to advance their education potential conflicts with classes and examinations are often cited for the absence of a playoff system to determine a champion others suggest it has more to do with preserving the economic fiefdoms of the big bowl games none of this is to imply that recent regularseason games have been devalued or lack excitement on the contrary , the last few weeks have featured a string of entertaining upsets that prevented top teams like florida , oklahoma , texas and tennessee from playing in the title game when all they had to do to get there was win the scores have been close , the participants heroic , the plays memorable , and the fans in their painted faces and schoolcolored garments have been screaming their fool heads off this rose bowl could be a classic , pitting the modern passing offense of quarterback ken dorsey and miami against the oldfashioned option attack run by eric crouch , the nebraska quarterback who won the heisman trophy saturday in another muchdebated decision it is an archetypal american match pitting a cityslick team from an ocean coast against plodding farm boys from the heartland in a time of realworld fears of war and terrorism , a big debate about football and a little anticipation of a tainted but intriguing championship game may not be such a bad thing photo colorado s defense swallowing up thunder collins during a rout of nebraska but nebraska beat colorado where it counted the computer \( associated press \) \( pg d8 \)
johannesburg , july 13 as the demolition of illegal shacks continued today , some businessmen , white farmers and politicians praised south africa s resolve the country was upholding the law , they said , reassuring foreign investors and the world that it would not tolerate the sort of farm invasions that have made neighboring zimbabwe a pariah in the eyes of the west but government supporters were keenly aware today that their resolve might come at a political price the haunting images of homeless women weeping before ruined shacks have flashed repeatedly on state television , leading some blacks to complain that the government seemed to care more about big landowners and investors than the poor and many farm invaders , who prayed and shouted as their flimsy shacks fell , saved their harshest insults for a government they believed had betrayed them there s a sense of alienation , said mazibuko jara , the spokesman for the south african communist party , which is a close ally of the governing african national congress people are beginning to raise questions there are now these pressures on the government , no doubt this anc government is a people s government and it represents , for the first time , an opportunity for a better life for people , mr jara said today we still believe that the anc has the people at heart but it must show that the communist party says the government should have tried to negotiate with the squatters , who began invading the farm two weeks ago , and to find alternative housing before forcibly evicting them but government officials said their only choice was to act swiftly if they had hesitated , they say , they would have endangered south africa s reputation as one of the few african countries considered worthy of investment it is bound to have investors hesitating to move in , thoko didiza , the land affairs minister , warned of the farm invasion earlier this week even the critics acknowledge the conundrum south africa needs the approval of western capitals to win foreign investment so that the economy grows , unemployment falls and government can make good on its liberation promises of housing , land and electricity for the poor but in winning the approval of the west , the anc has already been forced to take steps that will alienate its supporters the government is already moving toward the privatization of state enterprises and streamlining the civil service , both steps that are likely to result in job losses and anger from supporters the anc faces no real threats to its power in the near future most blacks still respect the party for bringing an end to apartheid in 1994 and despite their efforts , none of the opposition parties have emerged as a credible alternative to the governing party for the nation s black majority in the last national election , the anc easily won more than 60 percent of the vote even president thabo mbeki , whose popularity has tumbled , is still favored by more than half of the country , according to the most recent polls the panafricanist congress , the opposition party that fueled the most recent land invasion , garnered less than 1 percent of the vote but it clearly won some sympathy this week for assailing the slow pace of land redistribution to the poor south africa has built more than a million houses for the poor since 1994 , but it has fallen behind on its land redistribution program and is struggling to provide housing for the estimated three million people still on the waiting list so it was easy for supporters of the panafricanist congress to lure people to the vacant farm with promises of plots of land for only 3 hundreds of poor people from the crowded township took the offer and invaded the land the vacant land , which is a short drive from johannesburg airport , was the property of the government and a private farmer on tuesday , a high court judge granted the government s request and ordered the eviction of the squatters the demolition crews moved in on thursday and began destroying the illegal shantytown and when a leader from the pac stood up and assailed the government , an angry crowd of squatters cheered and hurled insults at the anc the people voted for this government , said dr motsoko pheko , the deputy president of the pac , echoing the sentiments of many squatters if a government fails to give you even a place to sleep , then what good is that government \?
east rutherford , nj the original west coast offense came to giants stadium last night for a highly anticipated game against the jets while you ca n't say that san francisco put on a clinic , the 49ers handled the jets , 1917 , in a game that revealed more leaks than the jets' coaching staff may have realized while so much of the focus has been on the jets' west coast offense , the most damaging leak last night was the jets' west coast defense the defense was manhandled , allowing 233 yards on the ground the most since dec 1 , 1996 , during the rich kotite era it was embarrassing it was ugly football , jets coach herman edwards said we 're going to pick 11 guys next week who want to tackle the paul hackett offense , discombobulated in the first two games , looked better early in the game , but after scoring a touchdown in the first quarter , the jets' offense was held to a thirdquarter field goal and a fourthquarter touchdown with 50 seconds left the optimist can say it s early in the season the realist can say it s already late as precise and technical as it is , the west coast offense , at its best , gives receivers the latitude to instantly improvise routes based on their reading of the coverage at worst , and especially in the jets' early learning stages , the offense is so spontaneous that everyone has a slightly different view of what west coast is , and what it is designed to do wayne chrebet , who caught two passes in the first half and three over all , said the offense was a work in progress on paper , it looks great , chrebet said of the west coast offense believe me , i looked at it many times , especially in the offseason i was like , 'there s a lot of opportunity there' curtis martin says the west coast offense is a state of mind it s just a name , to me , said martin , who rushed for 66 yards on 19 carries it s more of a place than it is a concept the terminology makes it as difficult as anything everything i'm doing now , i 've done before but the way it s called makes you more hesitant because you 're thinking about what this means it s almost like using synonyms i say jet black , you say midnight same thing for vinny testaverde , the new offense is more tangible than a concept and far more distinct than a synonym for the soontobe 38yearold testaverde , the technical demands are as fundamental as having to learn variations of a quarterback s most basic function , the drop back instead of taking the customary three , five and sevenstep drops , testaverde has the option of taking a threestep drop , a quick five , a fivestep and a big five , a sevenstep drop , a controlled sevenstep drop the drops are determined by the defense s coverage and the receiver s reaction to the coverage if i'm dropping back in what we call controlled seven , testaverde said , and i see the receiver in a man coverage , i'm going to put my seventh step in the ground and throw him the ball now if he gives me a zone look , i'm going to drop back , and on my seventh step , i'm going to hitch up and throw it the early problems have come when there has been a hitch when there should have been a zip , or a zip when there should have been a hitch testaverde was 11 for 24 for 192 yards last night the new offense calls for a reordering of the relationship between quarterback and receiver anticipation is replaced by empathy in the past , you 'd just say 'you have a manzone read here get open , ' testaverde said now we 're teaching how to run a route and what the quarterback looks for in this new system , testaverde takes his cue from the receiver if the receiver turns and lowers his head , the quarterback knows the receiver is reading a zone defense and intends to stop in a soft spot if the receiver reads man coverage , he will drive hard , cut sharply and turn his head quickly , expecting testaverde to deliver the ball quickly body language is talking to me as a quarterback , testaverde said when i see what the receiver is doing with his head and with his shoulders , he s talking to me he s telling me what he s doing in the past , it was n't that silent communication there s a lot going on after last night s loss , testaverde said he was surprised that edwards was so nice in merely saying he was embarrassed testaverde said he did n't know why the jets had played so poorly i do n't know how to fix it , he said now , there is an urgency with the jets to get it right is there too much going on \? and is all the complexity worth it \? do the jets have the personnel to run the offense \? more to the point , is the right personnel playing the right positions \? with two losses in three games , these are reasonable questions and none too soon to ask in football , edwards said , you try to create a situation when you put guys in position where they can use their abilities good players play when you put them together and put them in situations where they can all function together , they 're going to get better to me , that s the best way to do it i do n't know what that system is i think you create it with the players you have the jets are searching east coast , west coast or somewhere in between photo the jets' vinny testaverde , who was sacked twice by the 49ers last night , finished 11 of 24 for 192 passing yards without an interception \( barton silverman the new york times \)
from the embarrassment of a nationally publicized scandal to playing for the class a state championship , perhaps no high school football team has taken a stranger road than the one that has brought chappaqua s horace greeley squad to its meeting this afternoon with aquinasrochester in syracuse s carrier dome the weekend before classes started in september , the players celebrated the end of coach bill tribou s rugged preseason camp with a raucous party , at which a stripper performed , at the home of one of the team member s parents the police intervened newsmedia trucks and cameras invaded chappaqua in numbers not seen since the clintons moved to town the players lost their season opener to somers , 3113 that was their last loss the players and tribou stuck together , through a season when the coach was making fivehour trips to massachusetts to be with his dying father , earl the athletes performed prescribed community service , raised money for world trade center drives and played football with a new intensity i 've never seen kids work so hard , tribou said the ultimate bluecollar team earl tribou , a world war ii veteran who died during the playoff run , had a role in the success my father told me how close his fighting outfit was a 'community of fate' they called themselves , bill tribou said they vowed to all take care of each other to come together to survive i told our football team it became a community of fate greeley , the section 1 champion , has won two state playoff games by a combined 7812 score the section 5 opponent is the last hurdle today i 've had better teams , tribou said , but none that worked better together chuck slater photo chappaqua teammates after a thirdquarter touchdown during their semifinal 356 victory over amsterdam \( david jennings for the new york times \)
since sept 11 , an unusually broad coalition of elected officials , civic and environmental groups and homeowners across new york city s northern suburbs has come together over a temptingly simple demand close the indian point nuclear power plant frightened by the possibility of a catastrophic terrorist attack on the nuclear complex 30 miles north of manhattan , critics are saying with increasing intensity that it is time for the plant to be shut down but even as opposition continues to grow , the movement s leaders are confronting some hard questions what are the options for closing the plant \? do they provide any promising avenues for opponents to follow \? would closing the plant eliminate the security issues there \? and if indian point is closed , how will the region s energy needs and electricity rates be affected \? none of the answers give easy comfort to those who think indian point s risks far outweigh its benefits to the region indian point s opponents have raised the possibility of a terrorist attack on the plant that would send deadly plumes of radiation into the densely populated area , a release that could imperil areas as far away as manhattan they have said westchester county s emergency plan , which includes the possible evacuation of people up to 10 miles downwind of the plant , would never work at a public hearing on dec 20 , the president of one of the bus companies whose drivers are supposed to pick up children in the evacuation zone called the plan a fairy tale , saying the drivers would not go others have said the roads in the area jammed at rush hour even on ordinary days would be clogged with panicking families many opponents believe that the plant , which is in buchanan , ny , would be forced to shut down if westchester officials , who are responsible for maintaining the emergency plan , decided to withdraw from it a number of county legislators said they would vote for a withdrawal , and no nuclear plant can maintain its license without a federally approved emergency plan but federal officials have said the plant is safe , and they have no intention of closing it the federal government can declare that the emergency provisions are adequate even in the absence of county or state participation in the aftermath of the three mile island nuclear accident in 1979 , officials in rockland county , just across the hudson from westchester , did withdraw from the emergency plan at indian point , and state officials simply created a substitute plan for rockland partly as a result of that incident , the nuclear regulatory commission developed the socalled realism rule in the early 1980 s , stating that the commission could independently determine that a plant owner s emergency plans were sufficient if a state or county decides to withdraw in whole or in part from the emergency plan , the realism rule says we believe they will in fact do everything required for the safety of their citizens , said edwin f fox , a senior emergency planning specialist at the commission some opponents of indian point say that despite these rules , federal officials will not ignore the movement if it continues to grow the nrc may be the only agency with final authority over the plant , but what it would do in a changed political climate is not clear , said assemblyman richard l brodsky , who convened the dec 20 hearings on the indian point emergency plan and is a leader of the movement to close the plant neil a sheehan , a spokesman for the nrc , said the agency judged plants on the basis of science , not politics it has periodically closed reactors with persistent technical problems , and it shut down one of indian point s two reactors for almost a year in early 2000 after an accident involving a steam generator tube that reactor , indian point 2 , drew more criticism in recent weeks after four of seven controlroom crews failed their annual requalification tests but nrc and entergy representatives said the reactor was making substantial improvements after entergy acquired it from its old owner , con edison , in september there is no indication that entergy is daunted by the opposition the company has already spent about 3 million on new security measures since sept 11 , and it intends to run the two reactors at least until their current licenses run out , in 2013 and 2015 , said jim steets , an entergy spokesman there would then be an opportunity to renew the licenses for up to 20 years if politicians did try to force a closure , the nuclear industry would not go down without a fight you ca n't take away an asset like that and not reimburse the company , said maureen koetz , the director of environmental programs at the nuclear energy institute , a trade group i think it would require a lot of legal force entergy paid 528 million for indian point 2 earlier this year , and 967 million for indian point 3 and another reactor elsewhere in the state last year entergy also employs 1 , 500 people full time at the plant , and they would probably make their voices heard if the movement to close indian point got closer to success , mr steets said
duluth , ga , aug 16 before today s unexpected events , grant waite s previous trips to the pga championship had been short and sour not only had waite never contended at this event , the final major every year , he had never made the cut in four attempts , and none of his eight rounds had been in the 60 s for waite , the pga championship has meant playing the first two days , saying goodbye and watching the finish on television waite figures to be much busier this weekend , however by putting together a superb bogeyfree round and avoiding the pitfalls presented by the atlanta athletic club s difficult finishing holes , waite held a twostroke lead atop a jampacked leader board after today s first round shooting a sixunderpar 64 , punctuated by a birdie at the intimidating 18th hole , waite , a 36yearold veteran from new zealand , was two strokes clear of a pack of nine players tied at four under par waite s 64 set the course record , and in pga championship history it has been bettered only by the openinground 63 s shot by raymond floyd \( 1982 \) and michael bradley \( 1995 \) the secondplace logjam at 66 included david duval , trying to win his second consecutive major phil mickelson , trying to win his first fred funk niclas fasth of sweden david toms stuart appleby dudley hart brad faxon and k j choi of korea where was tiger woods \? a better question might be , when will woods begin to play like the world s no 1 player again \? struggling to hit fairways off the tee and making two costly doublebogeys , woods shot a 73 , leaving him tied for 100th place , nine strokes off the lead not only was woods s bid to win his third consecutive pga championship in serious jeopardy , he was in danger of missing the cut in a major for the first time since turning professional in 1996 so while woods faced the challenge of solving his problems , waite faced the challenge of handling a lead that hardly anyone expected him to have in his last six tournaments , waite missed five cuts and withdrew once yet , waite refused to dismiss himself as a oneday wonder shooting a 64 on this course is a great honor , and i'm very proud of what i 've accomplished , said waite , whose lone victory on the pga tour came at the 1993 kemper open , although he battled woods gamely at last year s bell canadian open before losing by one stroke not many people can say they led a major championship before not many people will make birdies at the par4 , 490yard 18th hole this week either , but waite did , ending his terrific day in style a huge drive at no 18 left waite with a 7iron shot from 179 yards , and the ball sailed beautifully over the water guarding the front of the green and landed 19 feet right of the pin from there , waite made the putt , tipped his cap and walked off the course breathing a sigh of relief mickelson made his only bogey at no 18 , ernie els \( 69 \) made a doublebogey and many others will suffer there as well on sunday evening , the 18th could be the site of heroics and heartbreak it s an absolute monster of a par 4 , said waite , who built momentum with birdies on his first two holes , including a 35foot putt at no 2 no 18 is going to be the talking point of the tournament much of the talk before the tournament centered on mickelson , who is continuing his quest to win his first major championship mickelson has often ruined potentially torrid rounds in majors with untimely blunders , but today he made parsaving upanddowns at both no 15 , where he sank a 25foot putt , and at no 17 , where he made a 10foot putt after blasting out of a bunker mickelson also saved par at no 18 , but he left a 12foot putt short there that would have kept him at five under par , in sole possession of second place nevertheless , mickelson liked his position and had left himself with another chance to capitalize this weekend the first round , you just want to feel out the course and not make stupid mistakes , mickelson said shooting four under par is a big help , because now i do n't have to shoot two low rounds to win i played pretty much the way i wanted to despite the athletic club s length , 7 , 213 yards , 55 of the 150 players in the field shot under par , as the soft greens allowed players who drove the ball in the fairway to attack the pins but missing the fairway could be brutal , as woods and many others discovered among those joining woods over par were davis love iii and colin montgomerie , who each shot a 71 if you do n't drive the ball in the fairway here , anyone is subject to trouble , said hal sutton , who opened with a solid 67 if tiger has a bad driving day , he s going to struggle getting the score he wants just like anybody else but with so many players bunched under par , the battle was just beginning waite had the early upper hand , driving the ball with precision and daring to go low on a dangerous course doing it for one day was fun but there were still three days left to separate the best from the rest before at major championships i have n't played well because i 've wanted to do well so badly , said waite , whose best finish in a major was a tie for 36th in the 1997 united states open today , i let myself play my game that s going to be a bigger challenge from here , but i'm approaching this as an adventure enjoy it , and see what happens photos grant waite shot a bogeyfree round and avoided the pitfalls of the athletic club s difficult finishing holes \( agence francepresse \) \( pg d1 \) phil mickelson shot a 66 yesterday and is only two shots back in his quest to win his first major championship \( associated press \) \( pg d4 \)
washington the problem is as old as the republic , only it s now getting worse how much information is the press , and therefore the public , entitled to get during wartime \? and how can the press , burdened by government and budgetary pressures , do its job effectively \? in times of crisis , the government moves instinctively to tighten controls over the flow of information , arguing that national security has to trump the public s right or need to know unsurprisingly , after sept 11 , the public agrees the anthrax scare adds urgency to the argument that this is a war like no other in american history , and everyone , including the journalist , must get on board the press , grousing as always about inadequate information and access , now finds itself in an awkward trap it wants to pursue its professional obligations to cover a complicated story in vigorous fashion , yet it feels constrained at a time of lofty patriotism from questioning or criticizing the government it is uncharacteristically muted , cautious , ready \( however reluctantly \) to play ball with the white house for what the constitution calls the common defense while understandable at the moment , is such a course of collaboration wise in the long run \? last week , for example , the white house urged american television networks and newspapers to exercise judgment and drastically curtail publishing or broadcasting propaganda , including possibly coded messages , from osama bin laden unspoken was the dangerous implication that the press was , perhaps unwittingly , playing into the enemy s hands within hours , fearing a public backlash , network executives promised more judicious editing in the future none wanted to be seen as refusing to cooperate with the administration s crusade against terrorism but , even if the administration succeeded in blackballing mr bin laden from all american networks , he would still continue to appear on foreign networks , like al jazeera or the bbc , which would then use global satellites to carry his image and message back to the united states propaganda warfare in an age of global satellites is a tricky and complicated business another problem concerns the manipulation of news budgets in large media conglomerates before sept 11 , budgets were growing tighter , because news executives continued to insist on unrealistically high profits staffs were cut and the number of foreign bureaus drastically reduced at tv networks and local stations , and at most of the nation s 1 , 500 newspapers , foreign coverage was an embarrassing joke the upshot was that the public was shortchanged and totally unprepared for the war against terrorism now , many news organizations must lean heavily on local stringers and green reporters when the war ends , will the budgeteers of the newsroom , who have little or no journalistic training , return to their old ways and continue to cut news budgets \? or will they meet their new obligations and provide the resources to cover an increasingly complex world \? unfortunately , all the evidence suggests that most networks and newspapers will return to the good old days of monica , diana and oj they fear a drop in circulation and ratings , which they ascribe to a public distaste for serious news in many ways , of course , this war is different from previous wars in one way , however , it is disturbingly familiar to journalists they know many of the players from the persian gulf war vice president dick cheney was secretary of defense in that era , and secretary of state colin powell was chairman of the joint chiefs of staff they briefed and pooled reporters with rigid discipline they wanted and got a very clean , efficient war , replete with smart bombs that played as well on television as the latest nintendo game not until months later did we learn that the bombs' iq was deficient and that they often missed their targets clearly , during the gulf war they did not trust a press they could not control and they still do n't when the war in afghanistan shifts from air to ground operations , the administration , already freaked out by leaks , is likely to reduce the number of briefings , sharply restrict access to the battlefield and wave the flag still higher in 1996 , between assignments , general powell revealed his true attitude toward the press when he told reporter barrie dunsmore that if the united states had been losing a battle and the press had published the story , thus informing the enemy , i 'd have locked all of you up and the american people would have stripped your skin off one reason the pentagon relishes its new relationship with uzbekistan is that in a closed society it is harder for the media to observe its maneuvers as one air force officer noted we can put aircraft there where cnn ca n't film them taking off the bush administration is rallying a wounded country to fight an uncommon war it must recognize that in this fight the press is not the enemy it is a valuable and necessary ally , if treated with the trust that its role in a free society warrants
east rutherford , nj , nov 15 for years , the minnesota vikings have been one of the nfl s elite teams this year , they are not , and there are signs of strain in the twin cities as the vikings \( 35 \) prepare for their game against the giants \( 54 \) on monday night in the metrodome , their oncemighty offense is struggling they rank 23rd among the nfl s 31 teams in rushing \( 1004 yards a game \) and 26th in sacks allowed \( 36 a game \) they have been blown out in their last two games 4114 at tampa bay and 4817 at philadelphia the only winning team they have beaten is the green bay packers a minnesota newspaper columnist has suggested that dennis green , in his 10th season as the vikings' coach , might lose his job and be replaced by mack brown , the university of texas coach red mccombs , the vikings' owner , said green was not the problem , and he urged his players to start winning in a teleconference today , a testy green dismissed the scenario he can say what he wants to , green said of mccombs , but he s not going to be on the field monday in a later teleconference , cris carter , the vikings' 15thyear wide receiver , said , that s part of being in the spotlight and your team is not playing well the problem is partly because of diminished rushing and poorer pass blocking robert smith , the vikings' best running back , retired after last season , when he gained 1 , 521 yards , second in the league tackle korey stringer , a rock on the offensive line , died of complications from heatstroke during training camp the problem is n't a lack of chemistry , carter said we ca n't do some things we did because we 're not running the ball offensively , we do n't have as many great players defensively , the vikings are lacking , too in those last two losses to the buccaneers and the eagles , they gave up 933 yards \( 449 rushing \) and 59 first downs green would not address that today , saying only , i have n't focused on that carter was asked if the vikings had to beat the giants to salvage their season it s a very , very big game , he said it will be very difficult , and if you lose one game your season becomes even more difficult it s a game we need to win it s a game they need to win , too they do n't want to be 55 they 're not playing great , either they 've lost four games receivers still dangerous soft offense or no , the vikings still have two of the game s most dangerous receivers in randy moss \( 39 catches for 538 yards \) and cris carter \( 35 catches for 510 yards \) people say they do n't have their usual offense , said will allen , a rookie cornerback for the giants they have new running backs moss had something like 15 plays over 50 yards last year and none this year that s because people have been doublecovering him and playing cover 2 on him a defense with a safety playing deep and that makes it real tough on the quarterback will peterson , the giants' other rookie cornerback , made this observation carter was a possession receiver last year , but he s going deep now moss has the speed to hurt you deep both rookies are aware of one skill that has helped carter catch more passes in his career \( 1 , 055 \) than any nfl receiver except jerry rice \( 1 , 317 \) he has probably the best shove i 've seen so far , allen said it s something the official never sees he s very crafty to which peterson added , i'm not sure how to stop it yet , but i'm getting better at it punter unlikely to play the good news about rodney williams , the giants' rookie punter , is that he took some snaps in today s twohour practice the bad news is that he says he is unlikely to play monday night even though the giants listed him as questionable because his broken right wrist has not mended fully except for two strips of bandages , the wrist does not look too bad but williams said it s day to day it gets better every day most of the swelling is gone when i took snaps , it shocked me in mind and body , but at least i'm practicing now gabe lindstrom , a free agent signed tuesday , seems likely to punt monday night in his first nfl game the realistic target for williams s return is a week from sunday against the oakland raiders
dr claude elwood shannon , the american mathematician and computer scientist whose theories laid the groundwork for the electronic communications networks that now lace the earth , died on saturday in medford , mass , after a long fight with alzheimer s disease he was 84 understanding , before almost anyone , the power that springs from encoding information in a simple language of 1 s and 0 s , dr shannon as a young man wrote two papers that remain monuments in the fields of computer science and information theory shannon was the person who saw that the binary digit was the fundamental element in all of communication , said dr robert g gallager , a professor of electrical engineering who worked with dr shannon at the massachusetts institute of technology that was really his discovery , and from it the whole communications revolution has sprung dr shannon s later work on chessplaying machines and an electronic mouse that could run a maze helped create the field of artificial intelligence , the effort to make machines that think and his ability to combine abstract thinking with a practical approach he had a penchant for building machines inspired a generation of computer scientists dr marvin minsky of mit , who as a young theorist worked closely with dr shannon , was struck by his enthusiasm and enterprise whatever came up , he engaged it with joy , and he attacked it with some surprising resource which might be some new kind of technical concept or a hammer and saw with some scraps of wood , dr minsky said for him , the harder a problem might seem , the better the chance to find something new born in petoskey , mich , on april 30 , 1916 , claude elwood shannon got a bachelor s degree in mathematics and electrical engineering from the university of michigan in 1936 he got both a master s degree in electrical engineering and his phd in mathematics from mit in 1940 while at mit , he worked with dr vannevar bush on one of the early calculating machines , the differential analyzer , which used a precisely honed system of shafts , gears , wheels and disks to solve equations in calculus though analog computers like this turned out to be little more than footnotes in the history of the computer , dr shannon quickly made his mark with digital electronics , a considerably more influential idea in what has been described as one of the most important master s theses ever written , he showed how boolean logic , in which problems can be solved by manipulating just two symbols , 1 and 0 , could be carried out automatically with electrical switching circuits the symbol 1 could be represented by a switch that was turned on 0 would be a switch that was turned off the thesis , a symbolic analysis of relay and switching circuits , was largely motivated by the telephone industry s need to find a mathematical language to describe the behavior of the increasingly complex switching circuits that were replacing human operators but the implications of the paper were far more broad , laying out a basic idea on which all modern computers are built george boole , the 19thcentury british mathematician who invented the twosymbol logic , grandiosely called his system the laws of thought the idea was not lost on dr shannon , who realized early on that , as he once put it , a computer is a lot more than an adding machine the binary digits could be used to represent words , sounds , images perhaps even ideas the year after graduating from mit , dr shannon took a job at att bell laboratories in new jersey , where he became known for keeping to himself by day and riding his unicycle down the halls at night many of us brought our lunches to work and played mathematical blackboard games , said a former colleague , dr david slepian claude rarely came he worked with his door closed , mostly but if you went in , he would be very patient and help you along he could grasp a problem in zero time he really was quite a genius he s the only person i know whom i 'd apply that word to in 1948 , dr shannon published his masterpiece , a mathematical theory of communication , giving birth to the science called information theory the motivation again was practical how to transmit messages while keeping them from becoming garbled by noise to analyze this problem properly , he realized , he had to come up with a precise definition of information , a dauntingly slippery concept the information content of a message , he proposed , has nothing to do with its content but simply with the number of 1 s and 0 s that it takes to transmit it this was a jarring notion to a generation of engineers who were accustomed to thinking of communication in terms of sending electromagnetic waveforms down a wire nobody had come close to this idea before , dr gallager said this was not something somebody else would have done for a very long time the overarching lesson was that the nature of the message did not matter it could be numbers , words , music , video ultimately it was all just 1 s and 0 s today , when gigabytes of movie trailers , napster files and email messages course through the same wires as telephone calls , the idea seems almost elemental but it has its roots in dr shannon s paper , which may contain the first published occurrence of the word bit dr shannon also showed that if enough extra bits were added to a message , to help correct for errors , it could tunnel through the noisiest channel , arriving unscathed at the end this insight has been developed over the decades into sophisticated errorcorrection codes that ensure the integrity of the data on which society interacts in later years , his ideas spread beyond the fields of communications engineering and computer science , taking root in cryptography , the mathematics of probability and even investment theory in biology , it has become second nature to think of dna replication and hormonal signaling in terms of information and more than one english graduate student has written papers trying to apply information theory to literature the kind of phenomenon that later caused dr shannon to complain of what he called a bandwagon effect information theory has perhaps ballooned to an importance beyond its actual accomplishments , he lamented after he moved to mit in 1958 , and beyond his retirement two decades later , he pursued a diversity of interests a mathematical theory of juggling , an analog computer programmed to beat roulette , a system for playing the stock market using probability theory he is survived by his wife , mary elizabeth moore shannon a son , andrew moore shannon a daughter , margarita shannon a sister , catherine s kay and two granddaughters in the last years of his life , alzheimer s disease began to set in something inside him was getting lost , dr minsky said yet none of us miss him the way you 'd expect for the image of that great stream of ideas still persists in everyone his mind ever touched photo dr claude e shannon in 1972
thabo mbeki s views on aids have drawn so much criticism that he has lately kept them to himself last month , however , the south african president gave two speeches that showed he remains badly misinformed about a virus that now infects one in four adult south africans and will kill between five and seven million over the next decade , the vast majority of them poor black people mr mbeki downplayed the problem , exaggerated the toxicity of antiretroviral drugs and suggested that advocates for treating the disease are racist south africa , with a medical infrastructure capable of providing antiretrovirals , should be a global leader in aids treatment yet even though thousands of affluent south africans buy these drugs , the government has done nothing to make them available to the poor it has not accepted international offers of free or lowcost medication and runs only a few programs to cut mothertochild transmission meanwhile , mr mbeki has appointed scientists to government panels who do not believe that hiv causes aids in august , he used old statistics to argue that aids is only the 12thleading killer in south africa it is actually no 1 and asked health officials to reassess the budget accordingly it is hard to understand how mr mbeki , a reformer in many other other ways , can be so irresponsible about aids his misunderstanding seems to be rooted in a defensiveness about race in one speech , he said that those advocating aids treatment viewed black people as germ carriers and human beings of a lower order many politicians in mr mbeki s african national congress disagree with him but virtually none speak out publicly , a testament to mr mbeki s unhealthy level of control even nelson mandela seems reluctant to challenge him on this issue mr mbeki came to politics after a lifetime of fighting white rule in south africa though it is hard to imagine a more malignant evil than apartheid , aids has already taken more south african lives if mr mbeki does not begin to address the crisis , millions more deaths will follow
washington , dec 14 don chaney saw a weary bunch being dominated in the lane , on the perimeter and on the fast break with the knicks trailing by 15 points after three quarters tonight , he sat four of his starters for the entire fourth the coach saw the situation as a nobrainer the players saw it as surrender latrell sprewell , who joined marcus camby , kurt thomas and mark jackson on the bench for the final 12 minutes , said the knicks' 9680 loss to the washington wizards at the mci center might have turned out differently had the first unit been given a chance to compete to the end i wanted to play , said sprewell , who scored 13 points but shot 2 of 10 in 33 minutes i do n't think that i was that tired to where i could n't have gone in and gave us something in the fourth quarter we were still close enough to make one last run at it you 're talking about 10 , 13 points with 12 minutes to go that s a lot of time all you have to do is make a few shots and get a few stops and you 're right back in the game it would 've been nice to at least make one more run at it at the five , sixminute mark , maybe fourminute mark , i could understand at that point you 'd just like to see us go a little longer instead of sitting the whole quarter chaney thought the benching was a necessity with the knicks \( 1112 \) , losers of three straight , showing little life and playing the nets on sunday at madison square garden while their former coach , jeff van gundy , would have blasted the knicks for their lackluster effort and scoffed at using a bad travel experience as an excuse , chaney basically pardoned his players because they did not arrive in washington as early as planned this morning after thursday s 9997 loss at detroit , the knicks' charter plan experienced mechanical problems and they sat for two hours before flying to washington then they were forced to land in baltimore because washington s dulles airport was engulfed by fog once there , they sat for another hour before their team bus arrived to pick them up it was about 6 am when they finally got to their hotel the players admitted before the game that they were tired , but none of them mentioned their long night as an excuse chaney also took that approach into the game , but afterward , he backtracked i thought we had no legs whatsoever , said chaney , who is 13 as knicks coach we played very tired we did n't follow our defensive assignments we had a hard time even getting the ball up to the basket i think the situation of getting in here last night just wore us down it wore us down mentally and physically when asked why he removed his starters so early , chaney said i did n't see the energy there that was necessary to get back i do n't think it had anything to do with their heart or determination i think they just did n't have anything chaney had plenty of evidence to support his opinion with a sluggish allan houston attempting to guard him , richard hamilton looked more like michael jordan than jordan himself hamilton beat houston shandon anderson for a seasonhigh 34 points , including 27 in the first half with hamilton cooking , the wizards grabbed a 5340 halftime lead on 48 percent shooting hamilton s display became so gaudy he made 14 of 24 shots in 40 minutes that chaney actually moved sprewell off of jordan \( 19 points \) and onto hamilton at the start of the second half sprewell said he wished the move had been made a lot sooner i wanted to , but coach chaney wanted to stay with the matchups that we had , so that s what we did , sprewell said the knicks , who shot 35 percent from the field and were led by othella harrington s 18 points , never challenged , and fell behind by as many as 17 points in the third all of the starters looked tired , and their play looked even worse camby , who had 20 points and 16 rebounds against detroit , produced just 9 points and 4 rebounds tonight he was so ineffective that chaney played him only 20 minutes and removed him for good with three minutes 28 seconds left in the third quarter houston had just 13 points and shot 5 of 13 , and thomas had only 6 points and 10 rebounds jackson had 6 points and just 1 assist while playing only 15 minutes chaney kept houston in for the first 4 minutes of the fourth before sending him to the bench with the rest of his unit despite their fruitless play , the starters said tossing in the towel after three quarters was not the right thing to do and none of them said their travel problems affected their performance nah , we 've gone through worse , camby said i still felt that we should 've had a shot and an attempt in the fourth quarter to make one last stand , one last run we never got the opportunity i do n't know what was going on out there i never question the coach , but all in all , we have to play better and we have to guard better rebounds latrell sprewell and michael jordan went at each other hard , with plenty of pushing and bumping he was getting me on a lot of shots and a few turnovers that i had , sprewell said he was hitting my arm and the refs were n't calling it jordan said he was as surprised as everyone else by jeff van gundy s resignation he expressed respect for van gundy , despite being called a con man by the knicks' former coach during the 19961997 season i have lived past that , jordan said why should i bring that back into light \? he s gone on and i have gone on from that and whatever his intentions were , were his intentions the way i perceived it was the way i perceived it i have n't relived it the wizards' christian laettner broke his left leg going for a rebound in the first quarter and is expected to miss at least a month photos allan houston , surrounded by the wizards' richard hamilton \( 32 \) ,

it is not often that an unpublished work by mark twain turns up , starts a bidding war between magazines and lands a book contract the story , a murder , a mystery and a marriage which runs 8 , 000 words or about 28 manuscript pages , chronicles the fortunes of a farmer in the mythical town of deer lick , mo , who is determined to have his daughter marry the son of the wealthiest man in town twain , who wrote the story in 1876 , intended it as what was sometimes called a blind novelette , an outline that would serve to inspire other writers to mimic the story line twain wrote the outline , and a version of the story , for william dean howells , then his editor at the atlantic monthly , and asked him to request that eight other authors , including henry james and oliver wendell holmes , submit versions perhaps miffed that anyone thought they did not have enough ideas on their own , none of the other authors did so , and the manuscript languished patrick e martin of buffalo a lawyer who represents the buffalo and erie county library and the library foundation of buffalo and erie county , which owns the manuscript for the adventures of huckleberry finn came upon the unpublished manuscript while searching files in 1995 when michael kelly became editor of the atlantic monthly last year , mr martin brought the story to his attention mr kelly said he felt it was important for the story to appear in the magazine for which it was originally intended , and he outbid the new yorker to obtain the rights it will appear in the july issue , along with some correspondence from twain about the story robert weil , the executive editor of w w norton company , which will publish the story as a book in september , said it was by no means a master work , but it was significant it would be wrong to say that this is the missing masterpiece of mark twain , mr weil said but it was written after 'tom sawyer , ' and it anticipates 'huck finn , ' and it is charming and interesting and very much in the twain tradition the story almost came to the public s attention once before , mr weil said in 1946 , the trustees of the twain estate sued two new york publishers who had bought the manuscript and had intended to publish it as a book in 1949 , a state court ruled that the two publishers did not have publishing rights so the story was never published mr kelly said that it just felt right to have the story back it s a very good read , he said of course , i would be even happier if we found the original contract in a drawer somewhere that said we owned the story for the original price of 43 cents , but i am afraid that is never going to happen alex kuczynski photo mark twain returns to the pages of the atlantic monthly in july \( associated press \)
jerusalem , june 4 a fragile new ceasefire plan was severely tested in its second day today as israeli forces traded fire for hours with gaza gunmen and stopped almost all goods and people from moving in or out of palestinian communities angry palestinians protested the strict blockade , imposed in response to the suicide bombing on friday that killed 20 young israelis in tel aviv fuel and food shipments to gaza and the west bank were blocked at border posts , while palestinians commuting to school or work were forced to abandon cars at internal israeli checkpoints and walk equally angry israelis demanded direct military reprisals for the friday carnage , and complained that palestinian security forces are not jailing militants known to have planned similar attacks yasir arafat s proclamation of a ceasefire on saturday was simply a public relations stunt , israelis rightists said , echoing palestinians accusations that the israeli declaration to defer military reprisals a week earlier was a propaganda ploy western diplomats , adopting the recommendations of a group led by former senator george j mitchell , had been pressing for a cessation of hostilities for six weeks as a prelude to peace talks but with each side accusing the other of violent provocations and bad faith , the expectation among israelis and palestinians alike is that the easing of hostilities will last not weeks but days the shaky truce was upset most severely in rafah , a crowded refugee town on the egyptian frontier in southern gaza , where israeli soldiers and palestinians fought a prolonged battle this afternoon with highpowered rifles , grenades and missiles the israelis said palestinian snipers had started the exchange palestinians said the israeli army had provoked the clash by moving tanks into the town , which israel denied at least 15 palestinians were wounded by israeli gunfire , palestinian medical officials said , and the army said three soldiers were injured , none seriously still , the volatile rafah district aside , there were few violent confrontations with israeli authorities inside the palestinian territories today security officials and leaders of dissident militant groups repeatedly pledged to honor and enforce the ceasefire orders issued by mr arafat no sniping or bombing incidents were reported within israel foreign minister shimon peres , in a conference call to leaders of major jewish organizations in the united states , said the change on the ground so far was significant , and urged patience there was no shooting today , but the day is still not over and we are being very careful , he said , before the rafah clash clearly that test should take a little bit of time even during the rafah fighting , defense minister benjamin beneliezer said , senior palestinian officials were making an effort to control the violence i see the orders that are being given to the field ranks by the palestinian authority , he said i see the messengers running from person to person in an effort to calm things down yet rather than see the brief respite as a harbinger of diplomatic hope , people on both sides of the divide watched the calm with grim foreboding palestinian security officials and political activists said they could enforce the ceasefire only in areas where palestinians have full political and security control , raising the prospect of renewed attacks on jewish settlers the palestinians said settlers have been shooting at arab cars and homes , despite israel s declaration to avoid hostilities for israel , any further serious attacks on its citizens inside or outside its national territory would bring an end to the restraint and , it is widely expected on both sides , extensive attacks on palestinian security institutions and militant political factions palestinians charged that by blocking trade and transit , israel is deliberately closing the escape valves on an already overheated pressure cooker inevitably , local militants somewhere will react explosively , bringing on israeli retaliation , some predicted ramallah may be calm right now , but the tension here is unprecedented , said dr mustafa barghouti , president of a private emergency medical service there people have this terror of an israeli attack how can the palestinian authority possibly control a ceasefire \? how can it control every single group , every single person \? tension also remained acute within israel the death toll from the friday disco bombing rose to 20 today , when another victim died , and two 15yearold girls who had been killed were eulogized in poignant funeral services by their classmates and immigrant relatives israeli security , braced for more suicide bombers , remained on high alert germany s foreign minister , joschka fischer , spent an unplanned additional day in the region today , talking to officials on both sides in an effort to get the truce to hold but american diplomats continued to maintain a wary distance , denying local reports of an intervention here as soon as tuesday by george tenet , the director of central intelligence in jerusalem , the american consulate ordered its workers and their dependents to stay out of restaurants , movie theaters , coffee bars , nightclubs and openair shopping districts , including the central ben yehuda pedestrian mall israel s unity government appeared less than unified today in its interpretation of the palestinian ceasefire effort , with mr peres emphasizing the overall easing of the violence , and other officials stressing the continuing outbreaks of gunfire , an overnight mortar attack in gaza and the discovery of roadside bombs we are not satisfied with the effort that the palestinians are making , because there is still violence emanating from the pa , a spokesman for prime minister ariel sharon said of the palestinian authority but within mr sharon s traditional constituency the hardline nationalist right , including the residents of the settlements he helped create the unity government was assailed bitterly for its declared policy of continued restraint in essence , what has happened is , the people of israel voted sharon and got peres , asserted shaul yahalom , a member of parliament from the settlerbacked national religious party yet even mr peres today seemed to hint that he too sees a palestinian breach of the ceasefire and israeli retaliation as preordained if we retaliate immediately , i think many people in the world would say 'ok , now two parties are equal , and we have to tell them not to escalate , ' he told the leaders of american jewish organizations by telephone today i believe that we acted wisely and courageously by showing restraint , and by giving the international community a chance to tell arafat the true story

allan houston and some of his teammates embraced him , hugging patrick ewing as if they had never wanted him to leave many of the fans who still feel that ewing failed to win a title for them arrived an hour early at madison square garden last night to watch him pop in a baseline fallaway beneath the building s pinwheel ceiling the ovation lasted maybe three minutes , a warm and loud appreciation before tipoff to honor the playing memory of no 33 in new york you need n't have seen the tears welling up in the big man s eyes to understand the significance at the garden , at least 20 , 000 fans clapping and roaring and clapping some more fitting , no \? the heartfelt sentiment was almost as thick as the guilt ewing s emotional return featured all the pageantry expected for a player who plied his trade for the same company for 15 years but in some ways , it also felt like an awkward retirement party for a deposed ceo , the guy forced to resign so he could make room for all the groomed young executives with fresher ideas and more tolerable salaries among some of the garden s legions and certainly some of the players on the knick bench , is n't there some hypocrisy in standing and cheering for a player so many people wanted purged from the franchise last season \? yes , ewing wanted more money than the knicks were willing to pay him in the final years of his career , and much of his departure was about business but he also felt that he could not win any longer , that the whispers in the locker room were becoming part of public conversation , that the fickleness of the people who watched him play and who wrote about him no longer vacillated from game to game in the end , it was possession to possession and when you miss your final six shots as ewing did against indiana in the decisive game 6 of the eastern conference finals last season none of the brilliant moments in those 15 years matter anymore this is the town we live and jeer in , where the same people who gave you good riddance at your newsstand six months ago could pass off good to see ew ! with a clear conscience yesterday morning that s ok ewing s detractors got what they wanted a centerless team that could push the ball up the floor unencumbered now that he s gone and the knicks are often stuck in a traffic jam at shooting guard , whom can we blame for holding back the offense \? the night after he played 38 minutes in boston and stayed up for most of the night looking after his father , carl , who was hospitalized after the celtics game , ewing finished with modest numbers last night 12 points and 5 rebounds in 32 minutes he was ineffective after halftime , and his former team won convincingly , 10192 forget whether glen rice has paid enough dividends in new york or whether the knicks moved ewing to seattle just in time before his 38yearold body betrayed him again it s mindless to judge a trade after less than a season more than two years after charles oakley and marcus camby swapped teams , people still inquire whether oakley s inside toughness is still missed in new york in toronto , imagine camby , tracy mcgrady and vince carter flying upcourt against the knicks last spring exactly who in the national basketball association is stopping that threeonone break \? the point is , you cannot go back in time if the knicks had known that they would trade for mark jackson in february and that their turbo , fuelinjected offense would grind to a halfcourt halt , they might not have been so steadfast about shipping ewing out of town on the night ewing came back , you wondered why everyone wanted so badly for him to go the notion that ewing was a polar region unto himself a human arctic cap surrounded by ice in his little corner of the knicks' locker room dispels a more real perception about him he was a good and loyal teammate rick carlisle , the former player , assistant coach and now a broadcaster with the sonics , told a revealing story about ewing yesterday during a radio interview his career in decline , carlisle had been cut by the celtics and was floundering in the continental basketball association when the knicks called him up on short notice because of injuries , he was in a knick uniform the night xavier mcdaniel and another seattle player got tangled up with carlisle and were about to physically confront the 6foot4 guard ewing came up from behind carlisle , got between the players and began glowering at mcdaniel in a manner that said , you want to go after a guy on my team , you have to go through me first whether you knew him for one day or 10 seasons , you were part of his family once you wore orange and blue everybody talks about him putting back my miss against indiana that sent us to the finals in '94 , but they missed out on a lot of other things about patrick , john starks said in a telephone interview from salt lake city on monday he kept me and other players on that team in ways a lot of people do n't even know ewing lobbied management often , asking them not to trade starks and oakley , who he believed were indispensable during the knicks' playoff runs in the 1990 s in one of the franchise s more bizarre twists of fate , ewing actually kept starks on the team in 1990 by blocking his dunk attempt on the last play of the last day of training camp before cuts were about to be made starks fell to the floor in agony , his knee sprained he did not know it at the time , but the coaching staff was minutes away from summoning him over and telling him he would be waived in accordance with league rules , he had to be put on the injury list i know it sounds crazy , but if that did n't happen , i do n't know where i would have turned to for a job , starks said patrick putting me on the ir might have been one of the best things to happen to me in life in 15 years , ewing never knocked a teammate or a coach he may not have always given the ball up when he should have or been the vocal leader many of his teammates wanted him to be , but he never badmouthed a single player he played with the same cannot be said about many of the players who played alongside him , players who , instead of voicing their grievances , should have just shut up and said , thank you , patrick , for carrying them on many nights they stood and cheered for him at the garden , as if this singular event could make up for all the groaning and booing there was a genuine and emotional feel to last night but it did not make up for the fact that patrick ewing was treated worse than any new york athletic icon deserved to be treated it was almost fitting that his tribute lasted three minutes that is more time than fickle new yorkers need to change their minds about how they feel about the greatest and most maligned player in knick history photo patrick ewing s return turned a potentially dreary game into a special occasion \( barton silverman the new york times \)
washington the running of the 133rd belmont stakes today evokes mixed emotions in many while this year s race promises to be a thriller , pitting monarchos , the kentucky derby winner , against point given , the preakness winner , a triple crown is not on the line racing fans are frustrated , a sentiment that has become an annual refrain no horse has claimed the crown in 23 years are contemporary horses simply not up to the test \? historically , horses have n't found it much easier each of the triple crown races is more than 125 years old , yet only 11 horses have managed to capture all three but after so many failures , some fans wonder if affirmed , who won the title in 1978 , was the final one there are myriad reasons why triple crown winners emerge so seldom trainer error can be disastrous the ragstoriches hero , seabiscuit , whose smashing performances made him a national icon , never made it to any of the 1936 triple crown races because his first trainer badly mismanaged him jockeys are also critical , making splitsecond tactical decisions while catapulting through an enormous field of horses at 40 miles an hour many deserving horses have lost when their jockeys misjudged the pace and gunned them into suicidal speed duels , moved too early or too late , or steered them into traffic jams other horses have been foiled by injury but it is the challenge of the event itself that fells most horses the triple crown is an ingeniously conceived test , probably the most formidable in sport , taking the fullest possible measure of every horse in three races over three distances at three very different tracks over only five weeks , contenders must reach for their deepest reserves of strength , stamina , versatility , durability and consistency courage , too , is at a premium , demonstrated most dramatically in 1937 when war admiral , unbeknownst to his jockey , sheared off the rear of his hoof while leaving the belmont starting gate , but won the race and the triple crown anyway , setting an american speed record the triple crown is a test that pits competitors against their own limitations , and a single error or weakness can prove fatal in other sporting events , like the world series , there is not infrequently the sense that the winner is merely the best of a mediocre field in a mediocre season in this respect , thoroughbred racing stands alone deserving horses have lost the triple crown , but no undeserving horse has ever won it , and none ever will in 1973 , the racing world was haunted by a mood similar to that felt today a quarter century had passed since the coming of the last triple crown winner , citation fans wondered if they would ever see another horse sweep the series then , on june 9 , a red colossus named secretariat roared down the belmont homestretch on an awesome 31length lead , winning the triple crown in worldrecord time those who worry that we may never see this again should be patient true greatness is extremely rare the next triple crown winner will be worth the wait
it begins in a bar , ends with a prayer and , after sept 11 , was endlessly quoted and reprinted to express grief over what had happened and foreboding about what was to come i sit in one of the dives on fiftysecond street uncertain and afraid , w h auden , responding to the outbreak of world war ii , wrote in his poem september 1 , 1939 in an america that was unaccustomed to being uncertain and afraid , yet was determined , as the poem s last line put it , to show an affirming flame , many people turned to poetry as something akin to religious ritual and auden s stanzas in particular quickly took on a quasiscriptural status that was not enough , however , to shield this 62yearold poem from the close moral and political scrutiny that words and ideas , as well as immigrants , have been receiving in the glare of the war on terrorism auden s words are everywhere , wrote the author of a letter from new york in the times literary supplement of london at least a halfdozen major newspapers reprinted september 1 , 1939 in its entirety it was read on national public radio it was introduced into hundreds of chat rooms on the internet in the chicago area , the great books foundation and the chicago tribune sponsored discussions of it students at stuyvesant high school , four blocks from ground zero in manhattan , produced a special issue of their school newspaper \( which the new york times distributed to its readers in the metropolitan area \) prominently featuring one of the poem s most familiar lines , we must love one another or die reasons for the poem s resonance are obvious , beginning with the month and day of its title , its new york setting and its evocation of how the unmentionable odor of death offends the september night history has driven a culture mad , the poem states and although blind skyscrapers use their full height to proclaim the strength of collective man , there is no disguising the fragility of civilization defenseless under the night our world in stupor lies many who recently found solace in september 1 , 1939 were aware of the poem s troubled history they knew , for example , that auden had declared himself unhappy with the very line now quoted so frequently , we must love one another or die that he had tinkered with it that he had then , for later editions , yanked out the whole stanza it concluded and that he had finally renounced the entire poem as infected with an incurable dishonesty to the disappointment of admirers , the poem has been omitted from many collections of his work lacking auden s fuller explanation of this incurable dishonesty , commentators have identified it with traces of sentimentality , preachiness or smugness that they detect in september 1 , 1939 but the times literary supplement s letter from new york brought on serious charges of moral and political failure as well a letter writer in the british journal called the poem a meretricious piece of work that , despite its seductive cadences , should be consigned to the scrapheap in particular , he denounced the lines those to whom evil is done do evil in return as a ringing apologia for the third reich as the product of versailles the reader also found applause for soviet communism in the poem s later references to imperialism s face and the international wrong to top things off , he judged the poem to be riddled with snide remarks about america another letter writer to the times literary supplement poohpoohed this perverse reading of the poem auden s references to cycles of violence and international wrong , this reply maintained , are hardly alibis for hitler or stalin but ageold , undeniable truths about the human condition as for snide remarks about america , the respondent could find none points well taken , and yet it cannot be denied that auden , in his 1939 poem , viewed the coming of war through a mixture of conventional psychoanalytic and leftwing sentiments , and viewed america with a similarly conventional antipathy toward mass culture and politics politics , whether democratic or dictatorial , are characterized in his poem as so much windy trash and rubbish the dense commuters who stream into manhattan s skyscrapers repeating their morning vow 'i will be true to the wife , i 'll concentrate more on my work' are treated with at least as much condescension as compassion one suspects that these characterizations would earn sharp rebukes if expressed in a poem titled september 11 , 2001 more important , would a contemporary version of the 1939 poem be found guilty of what has come to be labeled moral equivalence \? was auden shifting moral responsibility from totalitarian evildoers to past misdeeds by those under attack and to a universal human egotism in which everyone was more or less equally complicit \? would the new republic , which first published auden s poem in october 1939 , today cite it in the idiocy watch , the feature where the editors skewer what they consider egregiously softheaded responses to the war against terrorism \? this minicontroversy may say something about the postseptember moral , intellectual and political climate there is a new demand that ideas and language , especially about war and peace but also about religion and moral obligation , be precise and explicit a pronouncement like those to whom evil is done do evil in return might once have earned a passing nod now it is put under pressure is it true \? how true \? exactly what is it suggesting in the present circumstances \? in many respects , this heightened scrutiny is healthy it wrings out sentimentality it questions conventional wisdom , wellmeaning phrases and opinions certified to generate applause but that greater scrutiny can also be dangerous and stultifying it can be applied selectively it can filter out valuable insights that unfortunately come crusted with clich s or inflated with exaggerations it can dismiss intuitions that fly beneath the radar of clear and distinct propositions , even perhaps on the wings of a poem s multivalent images were the americans who seized on auden s 1939 poem careless readers \? or were they right to find there personal and even historical truths about the nation s trauma that transcended any of the poem s debatable lines \? poetry demands both rigor of intellect and generosity of spirit so , it seems , do perilous times
subway passengers in atlanta who looked through the dark windows of their moving train yesterday saw glowing fullmotion ads for dasani , the bottled water from the cocacola company the start of the unusual advertising campaign , originally scheduled for sept 11 , the day of the terrorist attacks , was a quiet event , but it may herald a new age in outdoor advertising city transit systems are emblazoning the dirt and graffiticovered walls of subway tunnels with illuminated signs that , when seen from a speeding train , appear to be animated the effect , similar to that of a flip book , is not unlike watching a 30second television commercial as you pass by at high speed , you see a fullfledged motion picture , said matthew gross , president of submedia , the outdoor advertising company based in new york , which has installed 1 , 000 feet of light boxes between the dunwoody and sandy springs stations on the north line in atlanta we use a series of compressed images and are able to get an extremely high frame rate about 200 to 300 frames per second an offbeat and fastgrowing phenomenon , intunnel systems began appearing this summer in europe adidas and cocacola , the first to experiment with them , bought space in the subways of budapest and athens through motionposter , a small company in oxfordshire , england motionposter has recently announced contracts to install systems in frankfurt and munich and in seoul , south korea many of the world s masstransit systems are considering similar proposals interest remains high even after the attacks on sept 11 we really have not had any letup in interest from advertisers , mr gross said no matter what happens , companies are still looking for a way to differentiate themselves in august , submedia signed a contract with the port authority of new york and new jersey to install a system on the path commuter rail line in manhattan \( mr gross said that in the wake of the attacks , no firm date has been set \) sidetrack technologies , in winnipeg , manitoba , is setting up tunnel ads in the subway in kuala lumpur and has plans to bring at least two more systems to north america next year all three companies are meeting with transit officials advertisers are using every opportunity they can find to communicate their marketing messages , to fight the clutter of advertising that surrounds us , sid holt , editor in chief of adweek magazine , said in an email interview and outside of prison , i ca n't think of a more captive audience than subway riders if intunnel media companies have anything in common , it is the belief that marketers must delve into previously unexplored territory to get consumers' attention mr gross said advertisers could expect to pay 35 , 000 to 250 , 000 a month for intunnel media , depending on location and passenger traffic the cost of dasani s threemonth run in atlanta , he said , is on the lower half of that scale cocacola s subway ad is made up of saturated color images of cascading water it s a neat way to communicate in a targeted , closed environment , said kellam graitcer , dasani s brand manager at cocacola phactory productions inc , a new york design firm , created the ad when you 've got a brand new medium , people do n't have anything that s been designed specifically for it , said rob walker , president of sidetrack technologies we can put images on both sides of the train so that the images can interact through the train still , some wonder how effective such ephemeral imagery can be diane cimine , executive vice president for marketing at the outdoor advertising association of america , who has never seen the ads , said intunnel promotion sounds wild and fun but wonders whether there s going to be a limitation on the communicability of these mediums even if the market is relatively small , some critics say the idea will inevitably backfire , particularly given the new skittishness of subway riders there have been socalled breakthroughs like this for years like ads at the bottom of golf holes or in public toilets , said kalle lasn , the editor of adbusters , a magazine published by the media foundation in vancouver , british columbia , that satirizes consumerism the real story , the way i see it , ms lasn said , is that we are at the beginning of a huge backlash against the encroachment of our mental environment some point out that the technology is similar to one used by marketers in ray bradbury s dystopian vision fahrenheit 451 motionposter maintains that there have been no negative comments in europe none at all , said michael pelham , chairman of motionposter the passenger reaction is absolutely fascinating the ads do n't block any beautiful views of city architecture or mountains , mr gross said this is n't a pristine environment this is an industrial environment it s just dark outside the window he also points out that advertising revenues help the cities this is providing revenue to the subway system it s actually directly helping the communities where these signs will be in place the economics of deals vary by city , but few transit authorities have the luxury of turning a blind eye to the potential revenue atlanta s intunnel advertisements are projected to bring the city several million dollars over the next few years i think people will ride the train just to see the ad , said tony griffin , marketing business manager of the metropolitan atlanta rapid transit authority obviously if this thing is a success , we want to look at it as a way of expanding photo workers installed ads on the subway walls in kuala lumpur in august when seen from a speeding train , the effect is similar to a flip book
in the pages of the fall 2001 issue of teen vogue , a publication from cond nast aimed at preteenage and earlyteenage girls , backtoschool fashion spreads and a boyband interview mix with advertisements for skechers sneakers , neutrogena acne cream and l'or al lip gloss there is also a first for the magazine a fullpage advertisement for bloussant breast enhancement tablets features a young woman in a bathing suit , her hair windtossed and her cleavage prominent the manufacturer , wellquest international , describes the herbal potpourri in the ad copy as a less invasive alternative to cosmetic surgery which will endow bloussant customers with increased cleavage , firmness and fullness testimonials in the ad cite the valuable rise in selfesteem and confidence that came with larger breasts seventeen s september issue has a onequarter page ad for bloussant tablets on page 331 it is at least the third ad for for the product the last two years , said jennifer maguire , the seventeen spokeswoman selfesteem and confidence are , of course , important issues for a magazine aimed at teenage girls but the question of whether bigger breasts will make a teenager or preteenager more confident , and the propriety of running such an advertisement in a magazine catering to a young audience has been cause for debate among the editors and publishers of magazines for teenagers after all , teenage girls are old enough to know the difference between advertising and editorial content , some magazine executives argue on the other hand , others say that the advertised suggestion that bigger breasts are an important component of beauty is objectionable for a young , sometimes impressionable , audience and as the marketplace for these magazines expands and the teenage population grows , the issue could evolve into a debate about sensitivity in the magazine industry at a time when it is suffering a drought of advertising in teen vogue , the bloussant ad is given premium placement , appearing in the first half of the magazine , considered valuable real estate for advertisers because readers pay closer attention to ads near the front of the magazine typically , in the rare cases that teenage magazines have accepted such advertising , the ads have run small and toward the back almost all the major magazines aimed at teenage girls do not accept ads for breastenhancement pills because , their publishers and editors said last week , they do not want to encourage young women to feel that breast size is linked to beauty or selfesteem ym , published by gruner jahr , has run occasional quarterpage ads for breastenhancement tablets in the past , but the new editor , annemarie iverson , and publisher , laura mcewen , who both came aboard last year , decided to refuse the ads cosmogirl , published by hearst magazines , also rejects the ads , as does elle girl , of hachette filipacchi , which will introduce its first issue next month teen magazine , published by emap usa , a division of primedia , also refuses to run the ads lynn lehmkuhl , the president of teen magazine , said that under her authority teen would never accept ads for breastenhancement products i know i would reject that bloussant ad , and i hope that everyone else would too , she said teen vogue s staff is not immersed in knowledge of the teen market , and i do n't think they are yet cognizant of the responsibility they have to the teen audience elle girl , which arrives on newsstands next month , refused the bloussant ad during the summer linda mason , the publisher , said that the magazine s editor in chief , brandon holley , was especially repulsed by it she felt it was fiercely antithetical to the philosophy of the magazine , and so did i , ms mason said brandon is all about celebrating your independence , your individual style , and we felt that the message in that ad was , 'you are clearly not perfect the way you are' it s not an offensive ad , but we just do n't think it s right for teenagers amy astley , the editor of teen vogue , said that she was confident her readers know that an advertisement is not an endorsement by the editors i am personally committed to having teen vogue promote images of health and wellbeing for our readers , she said i would like to emphasize that this is advertising and not editorial ms astley says she does not consult with the publishing side to determine which ads are appropriate for the magazine asked if she would mind having the bloussant ad appear in teen vogue again , she said i would prefer if it did not teen vogue s publisher , richard d beckman , declined to comment apart from the propriety of placing the ads , there is little evidence to suggest that the tablets which cost 22995 for an eightweek supply , according to the wellquest web site actually achieve what the ad promises a call to a wellquest spokesman , michael ackerman , was not returned while overthecounter drugs are subject to food and drug administration regulation , herbal supplements are essentially unregulated , assumed safe unless proved otherwise but the effects of the herbal combinations that make up many supplements have not been studied bloussant breast enhancement tablets consist of four herbal ingredients don quai , black cohash , fennel seed and saw palmetto according to a spokeswoman for the fda , the agency has not received complaints about the bloussant tablets but dr bill gurley , a professor of pharmaceutical sciences at the university of arkansas college of pharmacy and the author of several studies on herbal remedies , said that the tablets pose a potentially serious threat of drug interaction the herbal concoction could have adverse side effects when taken with other medications a teenager might be taking , like antihistamines or birth control pills , and lessen or intensify the efficacy of the prescribed drugs and on top of that , i would say that the possibility they increase breast size is slim to none , he said the likelihood that you 're going to go from an a to a c or d is remote and with young girls , body image is a big deal and they fall prey to some of that stuff photo these ads , for an herbal supplement promising fuller breasts , have been turned down by most of the major magazines for teenage girls \( pg c10 \)
albany , july 21 there is a tradition here that for decades was the pulse of state government , each beat an exercise of power , a clash of adversaries , a piece of dealmaking these days , it is more like a flatline it is known as a leaders' meeting , a gathering of the governor , the majority leader of the senate and the speaker of the assembly in the governor s office on the second floor of the capitol dozens were held each year , and it was how most of the big things got done in albany when state budgets were being negotiated or when horsetrading reached a frenzied pitch at the end of each year s legislative session , there would be several leaders' meetings each week , sometimes more than one a day but the number of leaders' meetings began to drop soon after gov george e pataki took office , and the decline had accelerated in the last few years aides to mr pataki , majority leader joseph l bruno and speaker sheldon silver said they could not recall precisely when the last one was held , but that there had been no more than two or three over the last year and a half , and none about the budget in two years coincidentally or not , this year has turned into a slowmotion exercise in frustration , with lawmakers accomplishing none of the major things that they set out to do new york is certain to set a new , modern record for a late budget by any state , breaking the mark it set in 1997 and again in 1999 , when the budgets were enacted on aug 4 126 days after the start of the fiscal year now , these meetings are being mourned from an unexpected quarter the same reformers and goodgovernment groups that once derided the tradition as three men in a room i have come to the grudging conclusion that the old three leaders in a room was less dysfunctional than no one talking to each other and no one getting anything done , said blair horner , legislative director of the new york public interest research group the problem was never the leaders' meetings , as such , but how they were conducted , and how often , according to mr horner and barbara bartoletti , legislative director of the league of women voters' new york chapter our opposition was to negotiating every important deal , including crafting an entire budget , with just three guys and a few aides , without taking into account rankandfile legislators' concerns and without any public airing of the issues and the giveandtake , ms bartoletti said what s clear is that in the absence of the leaders' meetings , she added , they do n't know how to deal with each other the offices of mr pataki , mr bruno and mr silver all strenuously denied that the three politicians each declined to be interviewed on the subject michael mckeon , mr pataki s communications director , insisted that the absence of leaders' meetings does not mean a lack of communication the governor has regular conversations with the speaker , regular conversations with the majority leader , he said he s always willing to talk about issues and exchange ideas and share thoughts but he has said repeatedly that he will not go back to three men in a room mr mckeon insisted that other states and the federal government manage to do business without the secrecy that was albany s hallmark but in fact , presidents and other governors meet and confer fairly regularly with legislative leaders mr silver and mr pataki have had a rocky relationship , and they go through long periods when their discussions are infrequent and brief john mcardle , a spokesman for senator bruno , noted that last year , with only a few leaders' meetings , many important bills became law , including a wideranging package of gun controls , an overhaul of the sexual assault laws , penalties for hate crimes , making doctors' malpractice histories public and the nation s first requirement that cigarettes meet fire safety standards it was one of the most productive sessions in history , so i do n't think you can say that leaders' meetings make much of a difference , he said but it was also a session in which the senate s republican majority was running scared as it faced reelection , and agreed to many bills it had previously refused to consider budget negotiations accounted for the bulk of leaders' meetings , but the way budgets are made here has changed in 1998 , for the first time , the assembly and senate met in public conference committees to negotiate a budget , with little involvement by the governor though heavily stagemanaged , the meetings increased rankandfile involvement , and legislators found them liberating then mr pataki vetoed more than 1 , 000 spending items , most of them democrats' projects ever since then , mr silver and the democrats have insisted on more involvement and more assurances than the governor is willing to give mr pataki , trying to find a middle ground , has offered to have his staff play an active role in the conference committees , much as the white house staff does , signaling what he will or will not accept but the decline of leaders' meetings goes beyond budget talks the major achievement of a legislative session that began in january was a ban on cell phone use while driving negotiations over the year s major issues changing the state s drug laws , reducing auto insurance premiums , overhauling school financing have been almost nonexistent before coming to power in 1995 , mr pataki and mr bruno , both republicans , railed against the secrecy of the old system both were veteran legislators , but outsiders , resentful of the clubby , freespending ways of albany mr pataki , in particular , has tended to treat not just the legislature s leaders , but the institution , itself , in disdain , often talking of how unhappy his 10 years as a legislator were he sometimes rebuffs attempts at legislation , then tries to accomplish the same thing through his administrative powers mr bruno and mr silver have also vowed not to return to the old ways , each one mindful that his troops are always clamoring for more openness and a greater role for them when mr bruno overthrew the previous majority leader , ralph j marino , the coup succeeded partly because of his colleagues' frustration with mr marino s secretive ways that was also the main criticism of mr silver in an unsuccessful effort to topple him last year the three men in a room problem was one of degree , that so much business , including the entire budget , was done in complete secrecy , mr horner said but you have to have leaders' meetings they have to talk to each other otherwise , how do you get anything done \?
it was a bright summer afternoon and the clock was approaching 4 15 pm david sinish , a senior financial underwriter in downtown hartford , was getting nervous more than a decade of experience told him that he had five minutes to get to a commuter bus to collinsville , but he was stuck on the telephone i have to leave right now to catch that bus , mr sinish said to the caller before hanging up it was an abrupt end to a phone call , but mr sinish had more at stake than a belated arrival to a homecooked dinner missing the bus meant he could have been late for his second job head instructor at collinsville canoe and kayak store like thousands of connecticut residents , mr sinish has more than one job and while the extra income helps with things like college tuition payments , for people like mr sinish the night job creates an opportunity to pursue a talent or hobby for these people , 5 pm means changing from business shoes to dance shoes , swapping a desk chair for a seat in a kayak or exchanging a pen for clown makeup it is a lifestyle that can require sneaking naps on a bus ride home or changing uniforms in employers' bathrooms but those who do it say they would not have it any other way if i ca n't have the one thing i need i 'd rather have a little bit of it than none at all , said leila valerio , who works as an administrative assistant during the day and a dance instructor at night according to the most recent numbers available from the state department of labor , connecticut is slightly above the national average in terms of the number of people who hold multiple jobs as of 1999 , 59 percent of connecticut workers had multiple jobs compared with 58 percent nationwide typically , people take jobs for one of two reasons , said steven lanza , executive editor of the connecticut economy , a quarterly publication published by the university of connecticut s center for economic analysis they have to , or they want to , he said and while second jobs may be associated with people who are down on their luck or having a rough time making ends meet , there are many people who use the additional job to explore certain talents and make money at the same time , he said it s sort of interesting that these motivations kind of lie on the opposite extremes of the spectrum and you find those kinds of extremes in connecticut , mr lanza said in many cases , people take second jobs because pursuing their dream job does not pay the bills or offer health insurance that is the case with clyde livingston , who works as a custodian at canton high school during the day and takes people on hotair balloon rides in the afternoon and evening the farmington high school graduate was first introduced to hot air ballooning by his high school art teacher after graduation , mr livingston went to the art institute of boston for three years before he left and returned to connecticut to work on construction jobs but his real passion was hotair ballooning it did not help that some of his construction work was in the flight path of his former art teacher s hotair balloon i would see his balloon over my head and i would say , 'well , someday it s going to be me , ' mr livingston said when he came into some inheritance money , mr livingston , 44 , used it to take ballooning lessons and earn his federal aviation administration license sixteen years ago he opened livingston balloon company in simsbury , which has grown into a business with two hotair balloons but is still not making enough money to pay mr livingston s mortgage though he would eventually like to run the company full time , for now he is keeping his day job , which ends at 2 30 pm leaving him plenty of time to fire up his balloon and soar above the trees that is kind of my true love and affection , mr livingston said i get a chance to meet people , and it just keeps my fire going plus i make money off it , and i'm doing what i want if leila valerio had her way , she would be dancing full time in fact , she tried to do that when she lived in new york during the early 1990 s and worked as a knicks city dancer after sustaining an injury , she returned to connecticut and became the choreographer for connecticut pride basketball team it was a great job but it was a parttime position the league has since folded , and ms valerio now juggles four jobs since march , she has worked full time at cw resources inc , a nonprofit vocational rehabilitation agency in new britain , as an administrative assistant for the meals on wheels program and contract services but at night , ms valerio , a 29yearold new britain resident , changes out of her business outfits and into her dance clothes and heads to carella alyce dance center in west hartford , where she teaches hiphop and salsa classes she also teaches dancing at capital communitytechnical college in hartford and in the few hours of spare time she has left , she works as a personal trainer at champions fitness center in cromwell and as a freelance dancer who performs with other women at events like the big e , the special olympics and bar mitzvahs

seattle , oct 17 the regular season was almost over and the topic inside the yankees' clubhouse was the incredible seattle mariners paul o'neill , who is no fan of the team and no fan of lou piniella , seattle s manager and his manager when he played for the cincinnati reds , did not want to hear about how great the mariners are they 're a very good team , but you know what \? o'neill said , not waiting for an answer they have n't won anything yet o'neill put his head down and sauntered away , letting his statement speak for him the mariners were rumbling through the season like a better version of the 1998 yankees , but o'neill wanted to wait until the postseason to crown them as a special team he wanted to see some results in october before calling the mariners one of the greatest teams ever because of o'neill , the mariners will have to work harder to prove themselves he lined a tworun homer off aaron sele in the fourth inning today , which helped to steer the yankees to a 42 victory in game 1 of the american league championship it was only o'neill s second hit of the postseason but it gave the yankees a timely boost and a quick lead in the series sele had not been pumping fastballs inside in the first three innings , so o'neill crept closer to the plate in the fourth with jorge posada on second after a leadoff double , none out and the yankees leading , 10 , o'neill wanted to pull the ball and at least advance posada to third sele uncorked a 21 twoseam fastball , but the pitch did not sink it was near o'neill s chest , and he blasted it into the rightfield seats there s no secret what the pitcher is trying to do and what the hitter is trying to do , o'neill said you know , i'm sure if you asked sele , he made a mistake he got a pitch up that s an easier pitch to pull , obviously the homer gave the yankees a 30 lead i was trying to get it out and down , said sele , who has now lost four straight postseason games to the yankees i knew he was going to try and hook it , and i threw the twoseamer and it did n't move when o'neill finished speaking in an interview room at safeco field , he walked down the steps one at a time to get back to the clubhouse the stress fracture in his left foot still caused him pain he had asked manager joe torre to put him in right field because he had not been able to get in sync with the game as the designated hitter torre obliged , o'neill went deep , and the yankees won another postseason game i think that we 're used to winning big games , o'neill said i do n't know if that s doing anything different than the season , but it does n't mean you just show up and expect those things to happen we have got jitters and nerves , just like everybody else , but when we take the field , we 've been successful with what we do because of our great pitching and , once in a while , a big hit
brookville , ny , march 2 on the rolling lawns of long island university s c w post campus here , students in ski coats and pajama bottoms lope lazily to class a sigma alpha mu fraternity brother sells raffle tickets in the hillwood commons student center and if not for a small knot of professoriallooking people bearing placards at the front gates , it would be nearly impossible to tell that the university s fulltime faculty is on strike when you look around this campus , it is not like there is this big cloud , because things seem to be going on as normal , said lisa chamoff , 20 , the editor in chief of the school s weekly newspaper , pioneer i think the strike has not been as effective as the union wanted it to be but then the union , the c w post collegial federation , is well known for both the frequency and brevity of its strikes this is the fifth since the union was formed in september 1974 the federation s first and perhaps most successful strike , in 1975 , lasted five hours and led to the union s first contract , which included a large pay raise another , in 1977 , was called the big one by union officials because it lasted three and a half weeks a 1994 strike ended after three days because , as the chronicle of higher education put it , almost nobody listened to the strikers' call for higher pay and a lighter workload those are the same issues behind the current strike , which began on feb 26 union officials would not say how many of its 318 fulltime professors voted for the job action on thursday , 85 of them were walking the picket lines at the campus s two main gates today , there were times when none could be seen braving the light snow blanketing the picturesque 308acre campus on route 25a , which was once the estate of the cereal heiress marjorie merriweather post the union and administration officials are to meet with a mediator on tuesday to reopen talks , which broke off on feb 21 after continuing past the aug 31 expiration of the most recent threeyear contract none of the campus s 11 , 000 full and parttime students , many of whom are liberal arts , business and health sciences majors , nor its 500 parttime professors , who are in a separate bargaining unit , have joined the picket lines or officially pledged support and the administration says that more and more fulltime professors return to work each day the number of classes without a faculty member was down to 23 percent on thursday from 30 percent the day the strike started , said joseph shenker , c w post s provost and even many strikers cannot seem to shake their devotion to teaching they are holding courses at a nearby international house of pancakes , at a pizza parlor , in their homes or on the internet and few of their colleagues are criticizing or ostracizing them this strike is very different than what you might think of when you think of a strike , said joan h digby , an english professor at c w post for 32 years who has decided for the first time not to honor a strike this time around , the faculty are quite divided over the particular issues at the core of the strike my friends on the picket line wave and say , 'good morning' i do n't really feel hostility flowing between these two sides professor digby said she hoped the divided faculty would find comfort in the words of her literary hero , the 18thcentury poet and artist william blake , who in the marriage of heaven and hell , wrote , without opposites there is no progression mr shenker called the administration s offer to raise salaries by 5 percent in each of the next three years extremely fair , especially in light of what all the economists are telling us about the status of our financial conditions he said the average salary for a fulltime professor was about 70 , 000 a year richard auletta , the union vice president , who has taught german , spanish and linguistics at the campus for 33 years , acknowledged that the average annual salary was higher than the national average , which the american association of university professors said was 58 , 352 in 19992000 but , he said , the cost of living in this new york suburb is higher than in , say , minneapolis the union says it is seeking an 8 percent raise in the first year of a threeyear contract and 5 percent in each of the next two years equally as important to many on strike is the desire for the administration to remove its cap on the number of faculty members who can be granted a reduced workload of 9 credit hours a week \( three classes three times a week \) from 12 credit hours a week \( four classes three times weekly \) nine credit hours a week is the workload of most fulltime professors at other colleges nearby and across the country , said ralph knopf , the union president , who has taught math at post for 40 years the union also wants the school to drop the requirement that professors must perform some measurable research to qualify for a ninehour credit week as far as research goes , that is our nature , and we are always doing research anyway , mr knopf said these days , students are doing some research of their own by their calculations , part of their roughly 16 , 000ayear tuition \( not including room and board \) is lost with each canceled class although the administration said that only a small number of students had missed classes , the president of the student government association , oscar m jonas , complained that the strike had caused the cancellation of some midterm exams and is becoming stressful for students if a strike continues for much longer , the value of the degrees will be diminished , he said someone has to bend somebody has to compromise photo madeline litzky of the new york state united teachers looks over a list of c w post

los angeles , june 14 hanging on one woodpaneled wall of john e bryson s office at edison international is a sepiacolored 1920 s photograph of two utility workers perched precariously above a raging waterfall , clutching thin wires as they measure the depth of the rushing water that threatens to sweep them away the picture is a nonetoosubtle reminder of the situation facing both mr bryson , edison s chief executive , and robert d glynn jr , his counterpart at the pge corporation , who have watched the state s utilities founder in a runaway energy crisis despite the similarity of their situations , the two companies have taken sharply diverging paths pge has put its utility into bankruptcy edison is hoping to negotiate its way out of the crisis from the outset , pge s approach appeared more orderly , analysts say , but it could easily end up being costly and timeconsuming edison s strategy , by contrast , is fraught with politics and uncertainty in the end , both executives seem likely to end up back where they started , at the mercy of state officials who may be as interested in politics as in restoring the two utilities to financial health california s political leaders continue to bicker about what is best to do industry analysts say that the relationship between the governor s advisers and legislators , including robert m hertzberg , the speaker of the state assembly , has grown testy and at times hostile mr hertzberg says the governor s agreement to save southern california edison , an edison international subsidiary , from bankruptcy is unworkable he is floating a plan of his own , something other legislators have considered as well mr hertzberg denies assertions that he is frustrated with the governor s tactics , saying we are just trying to salvage this thing at some point , it either does or it does n't come together in many ways , pge made the easier choice when its utility , pacific gas and electric , filed for bankruptcy protection two months ago it put its fate in the hands of a federal judge , a move in keeping with its long history as a regulated utility by contrast , edison has chosen the far less certain route , betting on a disparate band of lawmakers who seem to be learning on the job bankruptcy is still an option edison s recent 12 billion debt restructuring , a move similar to one pge made earlier this year , has left some on wall street to surmise that it is preparing itself for the inevitable mr bryson said he was doing exactly what a chief executive was expected to do , negotiating in a crisis , while executives at pacific gas and electric were spending their days in court or answering lawyers' questions and as mr bryson pointed out , that utility would ultimately have to mediate the same kind of political resolution he is attempting now clearly , we think we 've taken the right path , mr bryson said in a recent interview in his office in rosemead , east of los angeles we 've never been under the illusion that to work this thing out through the regulatory , legislative and gubernatorial process , it would be neat still , the doomsday predictions of a state plunged into darkness , because of a bankrupt utility , have not panned out that , combined with falling natural gas and electricity prices in recent weeks , has helped ease the sense of urgency the utility s bankruptcy has given the appearance of normalcy , said paul patterson , an analyst at credit suisse first boston as long as the situation goes on uneventfully , that makes it easier for the legislature not to take action added to that is the indecision mr glynn said he fears most recently , state regulators missed a crucial deadline to complete tasks necessary for a negotiated settlement only today did three requirements win approval from the utility commission it s hard to envision being in someone else s shoes , mr glynn said , sitting in his darkened 24thfloor corner office suite in downtown san francisco but i 'd make the same decision we did even today despite all the wrangling , mr bryson said he would proceed no other way at least for now \( legislators have until aug 15 to approve a negotiated plan to help pay off the utility s past debts \) mr glynn has embarked on a campaign to educate the public about why a settlement is the preferred option , handing out fact sheets explaining that bankruptcy is bad not only for the company , but for consumers a tutorial on the utility s settlement hangs on placards in the lobby of edison s headquarters mr bryson s point is this any resolution , which will almost certainly involve a rate increase above the 35 to 50 percent most californians began paying last month , will have to be approved by state officials anyway that was the case of el paso electric , which emerged from a fouryear bankruptcy process only after it reached a deal with local officials to raise electricity rates 10 percent while bankruptcy may appear more orderly , it , too , has costs time and money edison can try to negotiate a settlement either now or after a protracted battle in court and highly paid lawyers are the ones who profit most , mr bryson added , rarely creditors or consumers two weeks ago , federal bankruptcy trustees held a creditors' committee meeting in san francisco there , five pacific gas and electric executives were asked to explain , among other things , their recent request to the bankruptcy court to approve 175 million in management bonuses and why more than 4 billion earned by the utility had been transferred to the parent company to pay stock dividends more than 50 lawyers were the largest group at a local college , outnumbering creditors or private citizens gordon smith , the utility s chief executive , squirmed in his seat at times , rarely speaking as he ran his hand over his head the utility s lead bankruptcy lawyer , james lopes , sat near him and objected to questions that the executives did not want to answer pge has relinquished a lot of decision making , said david bodek , a standard poor s analyst but at the same time , it is difficult to say they did not make the right decision that is because the bankruptcy route is focused solely on making sure that creditors are paid , not whether customers think that they are being fairly treated and as mr glynn has said , he is betting that the bankruptcy judge , dennis montali , will be more sympathetic to his viewpoint than legislators in midmay , pacific gas and electric claimed a victory when the judge said consumers were not entitled to a committee to represent their interests still , the haggling continues to leave even those involved in the negotiations questioning whether it will require a forced bankruptcy by edison s creditors to motivate politicians to respond quickly , if at all creditors , which include banks and various power generators , could force the utility into bankruptcy at any time already this week , gov gray davis has suggested that southern california edison is headed in that direction and that only gives creditors reason to pause what we see in bankruptcy are clear rules , said joe bob perkins ,

it is alarming , you must admit , to see a grown man suddenly discover that he has a sex drive billy crudup takes us through such a moment with appalled eyes and gritted teeth in the spry new production of measure for measure in central park and while mr crudup is a handsome fellow , it is definitely not a pretty scene the rising star of films like almost famous and jesus' son , mr crudup plays angelo , lord deputy of vienna and superprig of all time , the sort of person , it is said , who will scarce confess that his blood flows but angelo has just met isabella , the comely sister of a man he has condemned to death for fornication , and suddenly the lord deputy s blood is rushing like niagara you can actually see a reluctant blush creep over this actor s deadwhite cheeks rigid with surprise and selfrevulsion , he wipes his folded lips with the back of his hand , as though to erase in advance any illicit kisses what s an angry young puritan to do \? for mr crudup s angelo looks to be barely out of his teens , and nature will always have her way with the young the measure for measure that was to open last night beneath open skies at the delacorte theater under the direction of mary zimmerman happily makes the point that nature is not to be denied it seemed appropriate that seconds before the play began in a recent preview an oriole flitted across the stage , and that immediately after a white egret preened conspicuously in the pond behind and how obliging of all the birds who sang a noisy accompaniment to shakespeare s winged words throughout most of the evening for ms zimmerman and her designers have chosen not to compete with the green outdoors but to take advantage of it the keynote of daniel ostling s delightful set is the image of two fat leafy trees in mesh enclosures when you look beyond to the teeming verdure of the park itself , it seems silly to put a tree in a cage those souls in old vienna who would try to pretend that man does n't take part in seasonal efflorescence obviously have n't got a chance thus does this measure for measure , the first of the summer offerings from the new york shakespeare festival , set up a determinedly optimistic frame for shakespeare s most bizarrely sour work this story of corruption , deception and hypocrisy has been described by coleridge as the only painful play in the canon and more recently by harold bloom as shakespeare s nihilistic farewell to comedy but ms zimmerman , who provided a blithe take on the comparably disturbing all s well that ends well in chicago several years ago , is having none of this her response to the socalled problem plays seems to be simply problems \? what problems \? rather than look for psychological consistency in the contradictions of tone , she accepts these works at face value as fables mr bloom may see anticipations of the marquis de sade in measure for measure ms zimmerman prefers to stress its affinities with the brothers grimm deconstructing fairy tales may provide insights , but ms zimmerman appears to believe that it also kills the magic her measure for measure may not be magic of the highest order you can get away with ignoring this comedy s essential darkness for only so long while there are charming individual performances especially from sanaa lathan as an isabella worth sinning for and daniel pino as her lifeloving brother only mr crudup seems to be working beneath the surface of things still , ms zimmerman s decision to emphasize the big metaphysical picture over authentic emotional detail pays off what after all do you want from an alfresco entertainment on a june night , when nuanced interpretation can be lost in the drone of passing airplanes \? in focusing on a grand scheme that makes fools of prudes and tyrants , and choosing the comic over the grim whenever possible , the production makes shakespeare s notoriously unpleasant play pass by quite pleasantly not surprisingly , this measure avoids the specifically seamy visions of decadent vienna common to recent versions \( whores and their customers rife with syphilitic tics and chancres people trussed up in black leather \) those debauchees may snort cocaine and wear mirrored glasses , but they tend to be about as sinister as the conniving animals in old warner brothers cartoons the play s gallery of vices is embodied with friendly exaggeration pompey the panderer \( the agreeable christopher evan welch \) is most notable for his bootlicking sycophancy john pankow plays the cynical lucio with a capeswirling swagger that makes him close kin to nathan lane s max bialystock elbow , the malapropdropping constable , is rendered by tom aulino la don knotts as deputy barney fife there are inspired quick sketches of the madam , mistress overdone , played by julia gibson as a blowsy , cigarettewinded working girl , and of a nervous , briefcaseclutching john named froth by daniel pearce and herb foster and christopher donahue , as men of state , offer lovely softspoken performances that capture the essence of the moderation the play advocates the crisply spoken joe morton has the pivotal and impossible role of the duke , vincentio , who hands the reigns of power to angelo so that the duke may roam the city in priestly disguise looked at realistically , vincentio is one sick puppy , a sadistic puppeteer of his subjects mr morton and ms zimmerman present him instead as a smooth master of ceremonies , responsible for moving the characters into their assigned places , whose worst sin is vanity like angelo , mr morton s vincentio registers instantly that he is smitten by isabella , the novitiate and with ms lathan in the role who would n't be \? she s a luscious , unaffected creature , only half aware of and frightened by her attractiveness she is also without the usual cargo of neuroses mr crudup takes care of that side of things all by himself yet there is room for hope for even angelo in this measure he is after all so young , and when he tries to seduce isabella , it s with the stiff , fumbling gestures of a boy who has only just learned what a girl is you figure that with time , he too may learn the importance of naturally doing what comes naturally measure for measure by william shakespeare directed by mary zimmerman sets by daniel ostling costumes by mara blumenfeld lighting by t j gerckens sound by acme sound partners original music , michael bodeen hair and wig design , mitch ely production stage manager , charles means managing director , michael hurst associate producers , bonnie metzgar and john dias presented by the joseph papp public theater new york shakespeare festival , george c wolfe , producer fran reiter , executive director rosemarie tichler , artistic director at the delacorte theater , entrances at 81st street and central park west and 79th street and fifth avenue with joe morton \( vincentio \) , herb foster \( escalus \) , billy crudup \( angelo \) , john pankow \( lucio \) , julia gibson \( mistress overdone \) , christopher evan welch \( pompey \) , daniel pino \( claudio \) , christopher donahue \( provost \) , sanaa lathan \( isabella \) , tom aulino \( elbow \) , daniel pearce \( froth \) and felicity jones \( mariana \) photos joe morton , left , as duke vincentio and billy crudup as angelo in measure for measure at the delacorte theater \( sara krulwich the new york times \) \( pg e1 \) billy crudup , left , as the conniving angelo , and daniel pino and sanaa lathan as the siblings claudio and isabella in measure for measure \( photographs by sara krulwich the new york times \) \( pg e3 \)
miami , april 8 it was another epic battle that will have fans of sensational drama yearning for a postseason encore there was the early rout that left the knicks so far behind the miami heat that they needed binoculars to get a glimpse of them sprinting away there was the late knicks rally that had the crumbling heat looking fainthearted and haunted by past blown leads there were questionable calls in the last minute by referee joe crawford that may have changed the outcome of the game and there were the flaring tempers knicks coach jeff van gundy was called for a technical and ejected by crawford with 19 seconds remaining and the knicks trailing by 3 points in the end , the heat won , 8176 , surviving their collapse and benefiting from the knicks' cold shooting and crawford s whistle the classic contest at the jampacked american airlines arena moved miami \( 4630 \) one game ahead of the knicks \( 4531 \) with six games left for each team but the knicks , who won the season series , 32 , own the tie breaker and will most likely be seeded third in the eastern conference playoffs if the teams close with identical records if they finish third and fourth in the east , the knicks and the heat will have to reach the conference finals to stage their fifth straight playoff series more than anything , today was proof that a game between the knicks and the heat is guaranteed to go down to the final possessions alonzo mourning , miami s allstar center , who returned from a kidney ailment seven games ago , faced the knicks for the first time this season the knicks' latrell sprewell sat out with a stomach virus , and allan houston , bothered by a bruised right thigh , scored just 7 points and none after the first 30 seconds of the second quarter still , this game was like all the rest you have two teams that know one another s positives and negatives , so i do n't think there s going to be any blowouts , said glen rice , who started in place of sprewell but managed only 7 points on 3of10 shooting i think it s always going to go down to the wire mourning , who was unable to dominate , had just 11 points and 4 rebounds in 25 minutes his four missed free throws in the final 1 minute 13 seconds had the greatest impact i do n't think he was a major factor , said marcus camby , who had 23 points and 15 rebounds i do n't know what he did i know he missed two crucial free throws down the stretch , but he was n't his dominating self against us with camby at his finest , the knicks actually controlled the area near the basket even though the heat often played mourning , brian grant and anthony mason together , the knicks outrebounded miami , 4338 , and outscored them by 3814 in the paint but the knicks were plagued by foul trouble , and the heat led throughout , going ahead by 2813 late in the first quarter and by 4434 at halftime in the third quarter , tim hardaway scored 14 of his gamehigh 25 points and helped miami push its lead to 17 points at the 4 06 mark that s when camby , who aggravated his sore right knee , and charlie ward ignited the knicks camby scored 10 points , and ward had 5 points , 3 assists and 2 blocks during a 174 run that cut the heat lead to 6460 with 10 46 to play the knicks went cold after that , going 4 35 without a basket , and miami pushed the lead to 8 points with 1 40 remaining a key play during that stretch was a missed dunk by camby that was rebounded by kurt thomas after his shot was blocked by bruce bowen , thomas appeared to slam bowen as both players hit the floor while going for the rebound thomas was whistled for a technical foul i really hurt us on that play , thomas said bowen s leg was under mine and i was falling down and i just grabbed him trying to protect myself it did n't look good at all that play should have been a technical , but if i just go down , then it s probably a nocall the knicks surged again , using a fullcourt press , a basket by ward and a dunk and two foul shots by camby to cut the deficit to 7674 with 254 seconds to go the knicks wanted to foul and send miami to the freethrow line , and when bowen got the ball near midcourt , ward charged at him and slapped at his right hand ward lost his balance on the play and flipped over bowen , who did not fall , and crawford ruled it a flagrant foul , awarding bowen two foul shots and the heat the ball crawford left the area without comment just after the final buzzer it may have looked like a flagrant foul , but i tripped when i got there so it may have seemed like i was attacking him , ward said i almost broke my neck trying to get there this is not college van gundy went berserk over the call , badgering crawford for the next minute or so through bowen s free throws , a 20second timeout by the heat and a foul by camby with 204 seconds to play eventually , crawford called a technical and ejected van gundy van gundy , who was ejected for the first time this season , said he did not say much at all to crawford , but he apologized to his players after the game it was a mistake on my part to get a technical foul , he said hardaway sank the technical free throw , and mason hit one of the two free throws after being fouled by camby camby scored a final basket , but two more foul shots by grant with 34 seconds left ended the knicks' hopes and another incredible game between these rivals rebounds allan houston said he hoped to play monday against charlotte glen rice was critical of the play calling , saying he should have gotten more postup plays against the smaller bruce bowen photos

the suspense is unbearable for weeks broadway insiders have been studying the heavens , reading tea leaves and consulting every type of psychic tool available to glean some hint of which show will win the tony award for best musical will it be jane eyre , the full monty or a class act \? the answer of course is none of 'em this is , after all , the dawning of the age of the producers , mel brooks s badtaste extravaganza that most broadway handicappers expect to win 10 or more awards including its inevitable beatification as best musical when those envelopes are ripped open at the 55th annual tony awards at radio city music hall on sunday night the only question for many hardened theater types is how many awards the producers will win the record is 10 , held by hello , dolly ! , in 1964 the producers is nominated for 15 , a record many believe the producers could take home as many as 12 \( the show has two nominees , nathan lane and matthew broderick , competing for the leadingactor prize and three in the supportingactor category , making 15 an impossibility unless there s a tie , a concept that has had many online theater enthusiasts panting \) not that organizers are predicting a dull evening the producers of the awards broadcast think that with mr lane and mr broderick as hosts , sunday may be the night when the tonys break their losing streak in the nielsen ratings this year there is such an abundance of wonderful material on broadway , said gary smith , executive producer of the cbs broadcast of the tonys ceremony and we think we can give america a taste of that to that end the show has a hired a new managing producer , elizabeth i mccann , and plans to play to its strongest card , that being \( what else \? \) the producers as usual , not everybody is thrilled with how the broadcast is planned last week the producers of jane eyre , for example , were outraged that its segment on the tonys show was cut in half candidates for the best revival of a musical have also groused that 42nd street is getting an unfair advantage by being prominently featured in the opening number , part of which was recorded on tuesday night in the times square subway station , utterly confusing scores of latenight commuters for all of that , when the broadway elite gather on sunday , there will be much to celebrate , including a record year at the box office , with some 666 million in sales and a perpetual crunch for theater space \( mind you , ticket prices have never been higher more than half of broadway shows now have a top ticket of 85 or more \) nearly 12 million people saw a broadway show during the 20001 season , according to the league of american theaters and producers , another record and though the awards for musicals may be lacking in suspense , there are some good races among the plays , especially in the acting categories , which are stocked full of worthy candidates selected by 705 producers , theater owners , actors , journalists and others an opinionated group to be sure the tonys are never completely predictable an informal poll of 15 tony voters and other theater professionals , all of whom spoke on condition of anonymity , indicates several close races , and a couple of others in which , amazingly , the producers nominees are n't the absolute favorite grab the remote as has become custom , the first hour of the broadcast \( 8 to 9 pm \) when the design , choreography , direction and regional theater awards will be presented will be carried on pbs , before the signal switches to cbs from 9 to 11 for the acting and production awards \( the preshow celebrity arrivals and other special awards will be seen on the tonys web site www tonys org \) conventional wisdom holds that the producers should begin its assault on the hello , dolly ! record during the pbs segment by winning as many as eight of the nine competitive awards handed out , including two almost certain victories for susan stroman , the oddson favorite for both best choreography and best direction of a musical if she does win the choreography prize , she will become only the third person in broadway history , after bob fosse and tommy tune , to win the choreography award in backtoback years \( last year ms stroman won for contact \) the 10th award of the pbs portion is the regional theater award , whose winner , victory gardens theater in chicago , was announced with the nominations on may 7 the producers is also the frontrunner to win best book , which mr brooks would share with thomas meehan , the softspoken architect of many of the show s zingers two of the other nominees , the broadway veterans terrence mcnally \( nominated for the full monty \) and john caird \( jane eyre \) , have other tonys to console them for linda kline and lonny price \( a class act \) there s always next year the design categories and the award for orchestrations are also likely to be dominated by the producers the reason has as much to do with the juggernaut effect as anything else , said one voter people tend to vote straight down the line on design , said one agent i doubt more than a dozen of the 705 voters would know a good orchestration if it hit them in the face keeping score
new brunswick there was a time when loud , dark and smoky was my kind of place the drinks were cool , the food was hot , the men were single and the music was nothing but the blues these days , loud makes the children edgy dark means i ca n't read the menu and the only smoke i like is wood smoke on ribs or chicken but i will happily subject myself to that triumvirate of youth to eat at makeda , a sophisticated ethiopian restaurant that serves food so good that i have added it to the very short list of places to take certain friends when they visit i say certain friends , because part of the experience of makeda is choosing to eat in the traditional manner communally , with your right hand watching someone flinch at sharing a plate or touching food would be a bummer and as one friend points out , it might not be the best place to take children who are at the honey , please use the fork , not your hands very good ! what a big girl ! stage but for those who are desperately seeking food that is usually excellent and is more exotic than most everything else you 're likely to find in new jersey , makeda is the place it s also the place for those who really , really like vegetables because their dominant religion encourages myriad days of abstinence from meat , ethiopians have developed quite a way with vegetables , evolving complex , mostly heatfilled seasonings from basil , cardamom , cinnamon , chilies , cloves , fenugreek , garlic , ginger , mint , onions , peppers and rue , among others those delightful flavorings begin with the appetizers , which draw on moroccan cuisine , since , as ogbe guobadia , makeda s owner , drily points out , subsaharan africans do n't usually eat appetizers i have several favorites a small plate of succulent chicken tenders infused with cinnamon , garlic and ginger and dressed with sweet onion softcooked green beans with parsley , ginger , garlic and cumin meatballs spiced with onions , crushed peppers , ginger , cumin and black pepper that leave your lips with a tingle and chicken tenderloins cooked with green olives and flavored with parsley , onion , ginger and black pepper the sweet , fresh shrimp served with saut ed julienned carrots and parsley was oversaut ed on two occasions with apologies to flannery o'connor , a good shrimp is hard to find the wait between appetizer and main course has stretched almost to the limits of acceptability during my visits , but luckily , there are those smoky , noisy elements to fill the gap on weekends , this place is brimming with the hip and the chic it s a generationspanning , demographicmingling spot to see and be seen , where african art on the walls and a delightful attention to detail in d cor will catch your attention if your fellow restaurantgoers have n't and if none of that quite keeps your mind off your tardy meal , there s always the wine list , most of which is from the southern hemisphere certainly the food is from the southern hemisphere though mr guobadia , 39 , is from nigeria , he settled on ethiopian cuisine for the fiveyearold restaurant because of emphasis on vegetables and the established popularity of ethiopian food in the united states the main courses are divided into the typical categories of beef , lamb , chicken , seafood and vegetarian , and are served ethiopianstyle , on injera , a large disk of white , spongy bread made from t'ef , a grain similar to millet diners tear pieces from additional injera rounds , then use those pieces for scooping and wrapping bites of food , so the injera , with its sharp , lemonlike flavor from the fermentation of the batter , becomes an integral part of each dish its sourness plays well against strips of juicy filet mignon cooked with collard greens and ratcheted up with onions , peppers and cardamom and it is a cooling counterpoint to the complex heat of minchetabesh , a dish of chopped prime rib , cooked with ginger , onion , cardamom and other spices the doro tibs , saut ed chicken with a mix of multiple spices with traditional honey wine , hot peppers and onions , needed the injera for its cooling abilities as well , as did the shrimp alecha , with its jalape o , but the assa tibs , a filet of haddock seasoned with garlic and multiple spices , then saut ed in wine , stood well on its own with no fork , though , you end up eating the bread anyway a fork could be useful with the rather uninspiring fried south african haddock fillet like the shrimp , it suffered from overcooking the fried haddock was partly rescued by its two excellent vegetable sides , which are included with each entr e and are pulled from the restaurant s substantial list of vegetarian offerings i did n't have one vegetable that was less than excellent or very different from the last , from the cold salad of green lentils , onions and jalape o with ginger , garlic and lemon to the green beans , carrots , potatoes , green peppers , cabbage and onions that reminds me of my mother s accompaniments to pot roast except for the seasonings of garlic , ginger and tomatoes indeed , the vegetables , with their complex spices and different preparations , are a fine meal on their own , and the restaurant offers that option , with a choice of five vegetables for 1950 expensive , you say \? let me tell you these are n't your mama s vegetables unless your mama s ethiopian the only real flaw of makeda is the dessert list , a wimpy compilation of average sweets all are shipped in i have seen the same apple caramel pie at a trenton restaurant and the same sorbets frozen in fruit shells at more than one spot , too skip the desserts instead , have a strong cup of ethiopian coffee , aromatic with cloves , cardamom and cinnamon lean back in your chair and remember why

it all started when a relatively undistinguished member of the lower classes was granted a vision of another world he began to preach , spreading news of the revealed truth , but alas , the world he described was so different from his own that he was declared a lunatic and interred for life in a short book , he ruthlessly described the narrow , twodimensional vision of his fellow citizens , while trying to evoke a fuller , deeper comprehension of the universe that visionary was known simply as a square , and the religious nature of his teachings was no accident he was invented by edwin abbott abbott , a doublenamed preacher who was also a teacher , social reformer and authority on the works of pope and shakespeare his book , written in 1884 and called flatland , has never been out of print , and it may be no exaggeration to say it has been read by every selfrespecting physicist , mathematician and sciencefiction writer , inspiring sequels , elaborations and imitations now yet another sequel has appeared , and its author is ian stewart , a professor of mathematics at warwick university in england and the author of over 60 books and a contributor to the mathematical recreations column in scientific american flatterland hardly aspires to the multidimensional resonance of its victorian predecessor , and its wit is considerably more strained and silly , but its conceptual ambitions are similar , and its imaginings far more varied and intricate for the uninitiated , it may help to point out that the original world of a square is literally twodimensional all residents live on a flat , infinitely large plane each is a regular polygon , a triangle or square or pentagon or figures with too many sides to count all these polygons can see in their flat world are lines created by the sides of fellow residents there is no above or below but then a threedimensional sphere reveals himself to a square by passing through flatland s plane he magically appears first as a point , and then grows into a larger circle as the plane passes through his equator , until he then shrinks to a point once again since it is impossible for flatlanders to imagine any higher dimension , the sphere lifts a square out of flatland , providing a glimpse of spaceland and we , as complacent threedimensional beings , are invited , by analogy , to imagine similarly unimaginable realms things have gotten considerably more complex since the euclidean universe of flatland was described so when , in flatterland , a square s greatgreatgranddaughter , victoria line , comes across her ancestor s samizdat manuscript and seeks a similar visitation , she is not just lifted into 3d space she is shown spaces with infinitely many dimensions , spaces with none , spaces with fractional dimension , spaces with finitely many points , curved spaces , spaces that get mixed up with time , and spaces that are n't really there at all in other words she is invited to see the surfaces and worlds imagined by recent theoretical mathematics and physics along the way and it is a knotty , twisting and appropriately contorted way we encounter geometrical universes in which all parallel lines meet or doughnuts easily turn into coffee cups malleable rubber spaces like those imagined in mathematical topology \( with their bendy plastic shapes and their surreal baroque worms are evoked without too much difficulty victoria also comes across intriguing oddities that show just how far mathematical imagination can go , including a creature whose interior is equivalent to a sphere but whose exterior is not but it does seem a bit peculiar that a mere flatlander can quickly comprehend difficult concepts that most spacelanders and readers are still wrestling with , including quantum wave functions , supersymmetry or minkowski space when things get truly extradimensional , it can help that the narrative is spiced with victoria s 2d puns , in which downloading becomes southloading and drunken hangovers become stickouters but cutesiness accumulates was it really necessary that she encounter the space girls \( including bendy space and squarey space \) who sing , dance and vaguely recall a onedimensional pop group \? and while abbott satirized the hierarchies and the scorn for women in english society \( women , for example , are not manly polygons but mere wiggling lines \) , mr stewart is content with a simplistic feminism \( gender equality awaits superiority even \) but mr stewart s lessons are otherwise appropriately flatlandish abbott s original intention was to give a portrait of transcendence , to show how , through our imagination , we might be lifted out of narrow conceptions he shows , again and again , that we come to know a new world by establishing analogies with the old we conceive of a fourth dimension in the same way a flatlander might wrestle with the idea of a third and we return to the third with a greater understanding of its properties and limitations similarly , mr stewart shows how mathematicians and physicists begin with experience and then use abstraction and analogy to create worlds beyond imagining flatland challenged the familiar conception of three dimensions flatterland challenges the familiar conception of dimension itself notions of smoothness are overturned geometry becomes twisted and fractured the ordinary becomes a special case of the weird what seems obvious within a given space the shortest distance between two points , the way one travels from one point to another , the limits on how far one can travel at all is shown to be illusion when standing outside the space transcend the space and you transcend its truths nothing , mr stewart implies , can be taken for granted transcendence is all but as mr stewart points out , there are also attempts to discover universal truths that might explain the bewildering complexities of our own space as well as many others so who knows \? someday a sequel to flatterland may appear that instead of displaying the varied properties of different spaces , may take the next transcendent step , presenting a completely different notion of truth , asking victoria line s descendants to imagine a coherence that now seems inconceivable flatterland like flatland , only more so by ian stewart perseus publishing 301 pages 25 drawing a weird creature who trots up on the bouncy surface of the rubbersheet continent and says wow ! a tea party \?

research aimed at developing a new , more widely acceptable vaccine for footandmouth disease , a vaccine that would stop or quickly contain an outbreak of the highly contagious animal virus the disease is causing a crisis in britain , where hundreds of thousands of pigs , sheep and cows are being slaughtered and then burned or buried , and it is affecting at least three other european countries so the research at plum island is attracting attention from afar if breakthroughs in footandmouth research occur in the united states , they can only happen on the 840acre island the department of agriculture laboratory is the only location in the country at which footandmouth research is permitted the times of london reported on march 13 that the best hope for a rapidacting vaccine to halt the spread of footandmouth disease may lie on a tiny speck of land off the farthest tip of new york s long island , a reference to plum island the laboratory is asking british authorities for samples of the virus for study plum island has also been pelted with calls from representatives of the pork and and dairy industries in the united states the beef industry is also worried all stand to lose billions of dollars if the disease breaks out in this country , which some experts say is all but inevitable but dr mason and his colleagues , working with a relatively small annual budget of 45 million , say they are at least five years from producing a new vaccine , despite the great urgency to move faster dr mason said that with more financing and greater support from nearby towns , which have had uneasy relations with plum island , the research might advance more quickly a lot of us are feeling frustrated that we do n't have something ready to go , said dr mason , the leader of the center s footandmouth disease research unit we know how serious this problem is but finding a new vaccine is a tall order it s hard to speed things up all of a sudden in the united states , the last outbreak of footandmouth in commercial livestock was in 1929 , but in 1978 an outbreak on plum island led to the slaughter of all test animals , and new containment measures were put into effect the virus can travel in the air in 1981 , an outbreak on the isle of wight , off the south coast of england , was believed to have been caused by a virus airborne from brittany it can also be carried on shoes , clothing or other objects that come in contact with it plum island officials say that the containment measures now in effect are strict researchers are required to shower and change their clothes after working in the laboratories negative air pressure is maintained in the labs , and the air leaving them is filtered test animals and potentially contaminated materials are burned about 14 million doses of vaccine for the seven basic types of footandmouth are stored in a vaccine bank at plum island but no vaccine is completely effective against the disease any new vaccine , the plum island researchers said , needs to be fasteracting today s fastestacting vaccine does not take effect for two days , which means that an animal can still become infected and spread the virus after inoculation another problem is that tests must be able to easily distinguish a vaccinated animal from an infected animal the united states bans meat from animals showing any sign of footandmouth disease and now allows imports only from virusfree countries including australia , new zealand , canada , mexico , uruguay and brazil in an effort to protect american herds footandmouth disease , which affects animals with cloven hooves , is not fatal , but it causes sores in the animal s mouth and on its feet , along with a drastic loss of weight the virus is not considered a threat to humans dr mason said that the new vaccine should be safe enough to permit it to be manufactured in the united states none of the current vaccines can be produced in this country , by law , so the plum island bank is stocked with those produced abroad for strategic reasons , we would like to be able to control our own vaccine production and not have to depend on another country , dr mason said dr mason works with marvin grubman , who has labored for some 25 years to develop a new vaccine dr grubman , a microbiologist who lives in southold , commutes to plum island by boat from orient point , as do most of the center s 180 employees dr grubman s vaccine research focuses on the genetic code of the virus covering vaccinated animals develop antibodies against the virus covering , enabling them to resist the virus , but they would not test positive for the virus
washington , may 15 the tiny staff of the bush administration s energy development task force is led by two former aides to senator frank h murkowski , the alaska republican who is the chairman of the senate energy committee the aides jokingly call themselves the alaska jihad but mr murkowksi , when asked recently about the role his former aides , andrew lundquist and karen knutson , have played in the task force s muchanticipated report , which will be released on thursday , replied , they do n't tell me anything on the eve of the release of the 170page report , the broad outlines are fairly well known the plan encourages the production of oil , gas , coal and nuclear power and calls for some tax credits for renewable energy resources and a push for conservation but since the task force s work began in february , most of washington has remained in the dark about how it operated , which arguments it embraced and how it reached decisions on some of the nation s thorniest energy issues individuals from the task force have met with more than 400 people from more than 150 groups over the last three months mr lundquist said today that he could not provide a list of all the groups he had spoken with i ca n't really tell you who , because there are hundreds i 've met with , he said administration officials also said that they wanted to keep private the list of those they met with to encourage the free flow of ideas still , they said that they had talked with a broad range of interested parties in a recent interview , vice president dick cheney said the staff of our energy task force has spent time with folks from various pieces , parts , of the industry we 've also spent time with the environmentalists i spent a lot of time with members of congress , listening to them , both parties , on energy so the idea that somehow only the energy industry has access just simply is n't true but last month , two democrats on capitol hill challenged the secrecy of the process surrounding the task force , which has met eight times in the last 90 days david s addington , counsel to the vice president , responded that it did not have to provide information about the process because all of the staff members are federal employees in addition , environmental groups have requested documentation about task force meetings under the freedom of information act , but so far those have been denied democrats and environmentalists say the process was tilted heavily toward the coal , gas and oil industries and point out that the energy industry is one of the biggest contributors to political campaigns , giving 64 million last year , threefourths of it to republicans among those who said they felt shut out was the consumer federation of america , the nation s largest consumeradvocacy group howard metzenbaum , a democrat and former senator from ohio who is now chairman of the group , said , the energy crisis is first and foremost a price crisis affecting consumers it s an incredible insult to the consumers of this country that , to the best of my knowledge , none of the consumer organizations were invited to the meetings or otherwise participated , he said juleanna glover weiss , mr cheney s spokeswoman , said no invitations were issued and groups had to request meetings we did n't invite anybody to meet with us , she said the leaders of about two dozen environmental groups had asked to see mr cheney , whose office turned down their requests instead , midlevel staff members from the groups met with mr lundquist and ms knutson alys campaigne , legislative director of the national resources defense council , said that that meeting lasted about 40 minutes but that the size of the group inhibited substantive policy discussion we asked who the deputies were on different issues so we could have more indepth conversations , and they would n't tell us , she said they said , 'just send us paper , we 'll take a look at it' the meeting felt like window dressing for us , but they got to check off the box that they consulted with stakeholders mr lundquist said he viewed his meeting with the environmental groups as a good conversation some of the industry representatives who did get audiences with the vice president said the task force s deliberations seemed a mystery to them , too john grasser , a spokesman for the national mining association , said we 've probably had as much input as anybody else in town but , he added , all we know is what we read in the paper this is a tightlipped process i have to take my hats off to them they 've been able to keep a lid on it richard s shapiro , senior vice president of the enron corporation , a major republican contributor and the nation s largest trader of wholesale electricity and natural gas , said top executives from his firm spent half an hour with mr cheney , but he could not tell how much this may have influenced the final report energy issues are a very high priority , and we 've had the opportunity to provide some input into the process , mr shapiro said but it s been difficult to get input in the task force other consumer groups have been weighing in with perspectives it s not an openhearing setting tom kuhn , head of the edison electric institute , the utility lobbying group , and a friend of the president s since they were classmates at yale , saw the process as relatively open the task force put out the word they were open to input , he said in an interview he said that his group sent them reports and that some executives met briefly with mr cheney given all of their interaction with so many groups , mr lundquist denied that the process had been secretive i do n't think that s fair , he said there s been no attempt to make it a secret process all it s been is an effort to work on and put out good policy
the legions rose repeatedly at yankee stadium last night , imploring a generation of yankees to respond as it has responded so often the past five years paulie ! paulie ! the fans chanted , and they cheered for tino and derek and bernie , begging and cajoling and a generation of yankees who have won three consecutive world series titles , four in the past five years , had nothing more to give the oakland athletics , as starved for success as the yankees were in 1996 , edged the yankees in game 2 of the american league division series , 20 , as tim hudson threw eight extraordinary innings the athletics lead the threeoffivegame series by two games to none , and if the yankees are to somehow come back home again , they must win games 3 and 4 in oakland this weekend they would then return to yankee stadium for game 5 the last time the yankees trailed a series by two games and were one game from elimination was in the 1980 al championship series kansas city swept them in three games that year oakland is 0 for 19 with runners in scoring position in the first two games of this series but have 11 extrabase hits , 8 more than the yankees hudson and mark mulder , the athletics' starter in game 1 , allowed only one run in 14 2 3 innings it s a terrible loss and it s tough to talk about right now , o'neill said we 're getting beat at our own game the yankees have become accustomed to winning all the close games in the playoffs , and they were within a run in the last few innings in games 1 and 2 and lost jorge posada and scott brosius and others talked after last night s game about how the yankees need to focus on game 3 tomorrow posada punctuated most of his answers with some form of this thought we 've got to keep fighting but the yankees have been fighting in the first two games they have tried to hit , and have n't after the athletics won the first game of the series on wednesday , johnny damon said he hoped the little fellow would come through in game 2 , and he was referring to hudson , who is listed at 6 feet 1 inch and 165 pounds , and will probably not reach those dimensions until his next growth spurt hudson went 22 with a mediocre 418 earned run average in september , and yankees scouts reported that his command was suspect in those games , his inaccuracy eroding the effect of his offspeed pitches what the yankees' hitters saw last night , however , was a pitcher with uncanny control of all his pitches his twoseam fastball , his slider , his changeup , his splitfingered fastball hudson threw firstpitch strikes to the first nine hitters not once among those first nine hitters was there a ballstrike count favorable to the hitter , never 20 , never 31 , never 30 the only time hudson threw the ball out of the strike zone in the early innings it seemed to be for effect o'neill reached to foul off an outside pitch to fall behind no balls and two strikes , and hudson straightened him with an inside fastball , chest high , an implicit warning against hitters reaching too far over the strike zone hudson did the same thing to bernie williams and posada the trend was established hudson reached a twostrike count on david justice , and catcher ramon hernandez signaled for a pitch and shifted to the inside part of the strike zone a ruse , because as hudson began his motion , hernandez darted to the outside corner hudson threw a sinker low and away , justice broke his bat hitting a weak grounder toward third he kept a lot of our guys off balance , posada said only 16 yankees batted in the first five innings , and of those , and only 2 hit the ball out of the infield two struck out , jeter hit a firstinning single , posada drew a walk in the fifth and there were 10 groundball outs they 're tough kids , yankees manager joe torre said , referring to hudson and mulder they have a lot of confidence right now yankees starter andy pettitte , in contrast to hudson , was in a constant struggle , throwing 26 pitches in the first inning pettitte needed 83 pitches in the first four innings , hudson 47 oakland was winning the battle of attrition , and in due time , the athletics took the lead ron gant , who platoons against lefthanders for the athletics , crushed a home run leading off the fourth inning , the ball going so deep into the stands that left fielder chuck knoblauch took only a few steps toward the fence before stopping hudson began to tire in the sixth , his followthrough shortening a bit , his fastball sailing a little more , and the yankees had chances knoblauch beat out an infield single with two outs , jeter rifled a single to right , knoblauch stopping at second o'neill was next , the fans roaring for him again , as they did in the nine years he has played with the yankees paulie ! paulie ! they chanted , as o'neill worked the count full , and when he drove the ball high into the air , their cheers rose , and then fell when his drive died well short of the fence justice singled with two outs in the seventh , tino martinez chugging to third scott brosius was due to hit for the yankees , and the crowd was roaring again oakland manager art howe came out of the dugout he almost always makes pitching changes when he comes out this time , howe went to the mound , jabbed a finger at hudson , pumping him up , and brosius grounded out to second o'neill ended the eighth inning with a groundout , perhaps his last atbat at yankee stadium , and he walked slowly off the field , head down as he descended the dugout steps the athletics led , 10 , in the eighth inning last night damon tripled with one out in the top of the ninth and the yankees' infield moved in , attempting to cut off the run miguel tejada smashed a hard grounder at third baseman brosius through his legs , a runscoring error oakland s lead was two runs and the place was almost silent the legions came to life again one last time in the bottom of the ninth , cheering the yankees stirred williams slapped a double inside the thirdbase line , and martinez walked oakland closer jason isringhausen appeared unnerved , stalking around the mound a bit , cocking his head in disgust torre sat in the dugout and felt very good about what he thought was going to happen posada struck out , however , taking a pitch over the outside corner justice popped out brosius popped up small and excited voices in the massive hollow of yankee stadium could be heard the athletics , one victory from flooring a champion inside pitch brian cashman , the yankees' general manager , appears to be close to making a decision between signing a contract extension with the yankees or leaving the team to pursue jobs elsewhere one highranking yankee executive was confident that cashman would resign with the yankees if cashman does leave , he could pursue a position with a handful of teams syd thrift is the general manager of the baltimore orioles , but he might assume a new role if another general manager is hired members of some of the potential ownership groups in boston have discussed cashman s availability , and cashman could also become a candidate for a position with the toronto blue jays or the texas rangers cashman s contract expires oct 31 , but he has been negotiating with george steinbrenner , the yankees' principal owner , during the past week with steinbrenner in town for the playoffs , an extension could be imminent the game , scheduled to start at 8 15 pm , was delayed 34 minutes to allow spectators at yankees stadium to watch the first halfhour of president bush s news conference on the scoreboard photos derek jeter showing his frustration after being called out at second in the first inning oakland s frank menechino barely touched the bag after snagging a poor throw \( barton silverman the new york times \) \( pg s1 \) ron gant s solo home run off andy pettitte in the fourth inning produced the only run the athletics would need to take a 20 series lead \( chang w lee the new york times \) \( pg s3 \)
police departments in cities across the nation are facing what some call a personnel crisis , with the number of recruits at record lows , an increasing number of experienced officers turning down promotions to sergeant or lieutenant and many talented senior officers declining offers to become police chiefs , executive recruiters and police officials say making the situation worse , in some cities a growing number of police officers are quitting for higherpaying jobs in suburban departments or private businesses these problems have come at a time when crime is at its lowest levels since the late 1960 s and the police should be feeling good about themselves but , the experts say , many officers from the lowest to the highest rank are questioning their occupation , tempted by higher pay in the private sector after a decadelong economic boom and discouraged by seemingly constant public and news media criticism about police brutality and racial profiling i would absolutely not take a job as a police chief , said john diaz , an assistant police chief in seattle , who at 44 already has a good national reputation and is sought after by recruiters for a chief s post the politics of being police chief have become so insane no one wants the job , said mr diaz , who is particularly attractive to recruiters because he is hispanic i work an 11hour day , but our chief is here before me every day and does n't leave until i'm gone , and all he gets is attacked in the media all the time the malaise felt by those from potential police recruits to chiefs is a major crisis all over the country , said cynthia brown , the publisher of american police beat , the largest circulation newspaper for law enforcement officers the difficulties are illustrated in her publication until a year ago , ms brown said , she had never run an advertisement from a police department looking for recruits , because police forces could still find all the applicants they needed in their own communities but in the current issue , there are advertisements for police recruits from a dozen cities , including portland , ore , and seattle , and smaller cities like santa cruz , calif , and sheridan , wyo there has been little public attention to the police departments' troubles , but jeremy travis , a senior fellow at the urban institute and a former deputy police commissioner in new york city , said , if this was a business , we 'd be in a panic mode there are no nationwide statistics on the problem but figures from several cities show the magnitude of the drop in applicants for the police examination , the first step in becoming a police officer in chicago last year , 5 , 263 people signed up for the exam , despite months of recruiting at college campuses , military bases and churches throughout the midwest , said cmdr bill powers , the head of the chicago police personnel division that is down from 10 , 290 people who signed up in 1997 and 36 , 211 applicants in 1991 traditionally , only a tiny fraction of people who apply are eventually accepted , making a large applicant pool important in new york city , more than 1 , 700 officers left the 41 , 000member force last year through retirement or resignation , a third more than the year before the retirement rate is expected to accelerate , with concerns about morale and pay taking their toll and with a large portion of the force soon to complete 20 years of service , when officers can retire with a full pension the number of captains leaving the new york police department tripled in the 2000 fiscal year from the year before , and over the next four years , more than half of the force s 2 , 100 captains and lieutenants will be eligible to retire while the number of people signing up to take the test to become new york city police officers rose modestly this year over last year , the overall number of applicants has dropped sharply in recent years in 1996 , 32 , 000 people signed up this year , 13 , 136 did in los angeles , where the police have been buffeted by scandals since the rodney king beating in 1991 , there were only 19 recruits in the police academy class in june , a record low , said amira smith , an officer in the employment opportunity development division when ms smith joined the force four years ago , there were 70 recruits in her class , and not long before that there were 100 recruits per class this month los angeles canceled the police academy because there were not enough recruits in seattle , the police department is having trouble finding officers to take the sergeants' examination , and sergeants to take the exam for promotion to lieutenant only 86 officers took this year s sergeants' test , down from 134 in 1997 , and only 10 sergeants took this year s exam for lieutenant , compared with 33 in 1997 , department figures show many officers with seniority do not want to start over in a higher rank , risking having to work nights or weekends , officers say and some sergeants do not want the promotion because lieutenants , unlike sergeants , do not get overtime pay
washington , june 18 to provide more electricity and less carbon emission , the bush administration has revived talk of nuclear power , with top officials discussing the possibility of hundreds of new reactors but it has been nearly 30 years since the last plant was ordered in the united states , and whatever policy makers say , ending that drought will largely depend on three numbers , industry experts argue 5 natural gas 1 , 000 capital expenses and storing 77 , 000 tons of radioactive waste and there is substantial doubt that those numbers are realistic the last item , waste storage , is getting new attention as the energy department tries to determine whether yucca mountain , about 90 miles from las vegas , is suitable for a longterm repository and the change of power in the senate brings a fierce yucca opponent , harry reid , democrat of nevada , to the position of deputy majority leader but whether yucca can be built and accept 77 , 000 tons of waste the amount it is supposed to accept in coming years is not the only prerequisite for the industry to start again yucca is a necessary , but insufficient , condition , said david morris , a minneapolis electricity expert who does not favor nuclear power he and others , including people who want new reactors , say the industry needs a licensing system that will not subject reactors to the lastminute problems that increased costs on the current batch but most of all , they say , the industry needs plants that are far cheaper to build than even the current optimistic estimates suggest a permanent increase in the price of natural gas would also be nice , along with a consensus that the other competing fuel , coal , is too dangerous for the global climate for the nuclear industry , the problem most under its control is the reactor s price the people who want to sell reactors do not yet have an acceptable new design on the market but say they can develop one to compete with natural gas the nuclear energy institute , a trade association , says that reactors would have to sell for no more than 1 , 000 for each kilowatt of generating capacity an industry measure \( a kilowatt is the amount required to keep 10 bulbs of 100 watts each lighted a kilowatthour , the typical unit on a homeowner s bill , would keep those bulbs lighted an hour \) that 1 , 000 is substantially more expensive than natural gas plants , which make up about 90 percent of the power plants built the last five years and sell for 500 or 600 for a kilowatt of capacity but reactors are less costly to run because uranium is cheap , while a million btu s of gas enough to generate about 170 kilowatthours in the most efficient plant will sell for 4 to 5 over the next few years , the nuclear industry says in briefings for wall street analysts , the nuclear energy institute has said that reactors at 1 , 000 a kilowatt produce electricity more cheaply than do gas plants when gas hits 5 for a million btu s westinghouse electric , which hopes to sell new reactors , says the figure is 4 not counting some recent sharp spikes in california , gas has been in the 4 range lately , double what it was two years ago , and has sometimes surpassed 5 but some people doubt whether gas will stay that high for long among them is william t mccormick jr , chairman and chief executive of cms energy , which operates the palisades nuclear plant in michigan and runs a system of natural gas pipeline and distribution companies it owns the largest terminal in north america for unloading ships carrying liquefied natural gas from abroad , in lake charles , la , which it is doubling in size , and is also trying to build terminals in mexico if the price stays at 5 , on a longterm basis , you can find an awful lot of gas , mr mccormick said in an interview and if drillers find a lot of gas in north america , he added , the price will come back down and he said imported liquefied natural gas could be found for little over 3 for a million btu s indonesia , australia and countries in the persian gulf region and on the west coast of africa will all drill , liquefy and export for that price , he said , and their supplies are vast and is it possible to build a reactor for 1 , 000 a kilowatt \? some of the 103 now in service cost more than triple that amount even more in today s dollars but proponents are counting on more efficient building techniques and lower interest costs westinghouse electric spent much of the 1990 s designing a reactor that would be easier to build and operate it wanted fewer moving parts and more parts that could be assembled at a factory instead of in the field , cutting construction costs and reducing quality questions the plant , called the ap600 for advanced passive , 600 megawatts would have cost 1 , 400 to 1 , 500 a kilowatt , the company said , but the real number is uncertain because none were ordered similarly , general electric designed the advanced boiling water reactor , which it said would sell for 1 , 400 to 1 , 600 , depending on the host country , but nobody in the united states ordered one either now westinghouse is redesigning the ap600 as a 1 , 000megawatt plant that increase in capacity , it says , will raise capital costs only 10 percent , bringing the capital cost per kilowatt down to 1 , 000 but that cost , westinghouse says , can be brought that low only after builders get practice putting up plants efficiently we 're quite comfortable in competing with both gas and coal , said charles w pryor , chief executive of westinghouse electric now a subsidiary of bnfl , the former british nuclear fuels the plants would largely be built in factories to cut costs and quality problems , mr pryor said , and legal questions would be settled before construction started in fact , the nuclear regulatory commission has already revised its licensing process , although no one has tested it there is some belief that not all the energy eggs should go in the natural gas basket the georgia public service commission , for example , regularly requires utility companies to ask for bids from outside companies to provide new plants this year the commission demanded that georgia power , the biggest utility in the state , mention nuclear and coal in its requests for proposals one idea , said daniel r cearfoss , a staff engineer for the commission , is fuel diversity the commission would like to know how much extra it would cost to hedge the state s energy bets by building plants that would use uranium or coal but mr cearfoss said that he doubted anyone would propose a nuclear plant , and that even if someone did , the bid would be hard to evaluate because there was no modern track record for construction costs georgia , however , is often cited as a possible icebreaker for nuclear power its twinunit vogle plant has space for four reactors , and the betting among experts is that if another reactor is ordered , it will go next to an existing one the southern company owns georgia power , along with alabama power , mississippi power and gulf power , and operates six reactors laura gillig , a spokeswoman for southern , said that even though nuclear power is going through some sort of renaissance , it still needs that public support and , she added , it does need to be competitive photo three mile island in pennsylvania was the site of the worst nuclear accident in the united states \( keith meyers the new york times \)
purchase , ny , may 5 latrell sprewell and jeff van gundy met for 25 minutes today , two downcast individuals whose worlds revolve around winning basketball games if sprewell was as forthcoming with his coach as he was with reporters , then van gundy will spend the summer pushing knicks management to do everything it can to bring a strong , tough big man to new york rather than back off his harsh assessment of his teammates after the knicks were eliminated from the playoffs by the toronto raptors on friday night , sprewell went even further today , all but demanding that the knicks revamp their roster i think something has to be done this summer as far as getting us some size and some kind of toughness , said sprewell , who accused unnamed teammates of giving less than 100 percent in friday s 9389 loss in the decisive game 5 we 're a perimeter team we got away with it to a certain extent during the regular season , but i think the evil monster showed his head at the end we fought those guys , but they were bigger and stronger , he added , referring to the raptors they beat us up in the end , their size won out there s no other way to cut it they did a good job of being physical they deserved to win they were the better team the knicks were eliminated in the first round of the playoffs for the first time since 1991 they lost in the eastern conference finals last year and in the national basketball association finals in 1999 the top player on sprewell s wish list is sacramento power forward chris webber , who will be a free agent this summer they are close friends who played together in golden state during the 199394 season both have said they would love a reunion , and sprewell said today that he would do everything he could to make it a reality we need a guy like that , he said i do n't know what the chances are but if it comes down to something with chris , i'm going to do whatever i can within the rules to get him here because the knicks are over the salary cap , it would take a blockbuster signandtrade deal to obtain webber it would cost them at least two of their top players , probably allan houston and either marcus camby or kurt thomas when asked if he would be agreeable to trading two of the knicks' top three players for a player like webber , sprewell said , i think i would i would hate to see it , because obviously i'm close to some of the guys on this team , sprewell said but i'm all about winning and right now we have to make changes to get better personal feelings have to be set aside and they have to bring in guys who are going to help us get back to the finals none of the other knicks suggested that significant changes were in order but , an hour after sprewell made his comments , van gundy and general manager scott layden did nothing but praise sprewell and defend his right to put them on notice he s earned every right to express his opinion because he s about winning , van gundy said i think the biggest person of influence in this organization is latrell i think players can relate to him , and anybody who s committed to winning can relate to his passion for winning van gundy said the bond he felt with sprewell equaled , if not surpassed , the one he had with patrick ewing , and he agreed with sprewell s view that the knicks must get bigger i thought kurt had an excellent year i thought marcus had an excellent year , van gundy said but if you want to compete at the highest level , i think we all know that we 're going to have to get more size in addition to webber , the knicks could look into trading for rasheed wallace , the temperamental portland trail blazers power forward any deal of significance would almost certainly have to involve houston , who can opt out of his contract and become a free agent on july 1 houston has two years and 21 million left on his contract he said he wanted to return to the knicks , and the knicks said they wanted him back certainly , i think allan has had a great run here , van gundy said if he decides to opt out of his contract , we 're going to make every effort to see that he s back with the knicks camby , sounding as if he wanted to return , said the knicks' top priority should be resigning houston but he understood there might be changes things could get ugly around here , camby said , so we 'll see if this team remains intact the knicks would rather trade glen rice , but his market value is practically nonexistent because he is 33 , has three years and 27 million left on his contract and played most of the season on a sore left foot rice said his top priority was to rest and rehabilitate his foot i'm going to try to get in the best shape possible to give myself a better chance to put more pressure on jeff to put me in the starting lineup , said rice , who may have foot surgery sprewell , houston and rice were revolving swingmen this season , but sprewell said he could not see playing another season that way i think we did well with that situation , but in the end it s not going to be what wins in the playoffs when you 're facing teams with size and you do n't have the inside presence , sprewell said though the knicks will have trouble making a major trade because of their contractual obligations , sprewell said he could not fathom showing up for training camp in october with the same teammates who was layden to disagree \? we 're going to be very busy this summer and we 're always looking to improve the team , layden said rebounds larry johnson will have his sore back examined next week he is hoping to return next season luc longley said he would rehabilitate his sore left ankle , which sidelined him for the last two months of the season he also hopes to put off retirement and fulfill the final three years of his contract latrell sprewell said patrick ewing would have helped the knicks against toronto i do n't know if it made sense , sprewell said of the trading of ewing photo latrell sprewell has earned the right to speak his mind on personnel moves , according to coach jeff van gundy \( barton silverman the new york times \)

they 'd rather believe what they hear in the streets but i tell them to get their facts straight i'm not going anywhere since december , harding has been in the throes of an overhaul after a decision by the new england association of schools and colleges to place the school on probation , an announcement harding had braced for since august , when the school first received notice plainfield high school was also put on probation in december hartford public high school has been on probation since 1997 in all , 24 of the 700 schools accredited by the new england association are now on probation , a typical amount , said joseph daisy , associate director of the association s commission on public secondary schools schools are placed on probation when they fail to meet a certain number of standards which can range from academic shortcomings to a lack of extracurricular activities established by the new england association unless harding makes enough improvements to satisfy the new england association , the school will lose its accreditation status but that is rare in the last 15 years , only five schools under the association have faced that consequence none of them in connecticut among the problems reported at harding were a lack of clear expectations set by teachers for students , weaknesses in the curriculum and structural deficiencies in the building itself harding must submit a special progress report about every six months to the new england association , which will determine whether the school is making reasonable progress mr daisy said that the loss of accreditation would mean that students could be rejected from some colleges be declared ineligible for athletic teams by the national collegiate athletic association and be denied scholarships there are also citywide ramifications other than the crime rate , the quality of the public school is the second most important factor in determining where to live , mr daisy said one of the ways to determine quality is through accreditation there are realtors in some communities who have those accreditation reports right in their office externally , accreditation can be viewed by some people as an indicator of school quality and effectiveness many administration and staff members at harding found the probation upsetting it was shocking , said ms muniz , who has worked as a bilingual teacher at the school for eight years and started at the school as a teacher s aide 14 years ago our pride was hurt they have to blame someone , and they always blame the teachers but the school decided not to contest the probation and has since formed a sevenmember followup committee to address the 80 recommended areas for improvement cited by the 96page report the new england association , which evaluates schools every 10 years , concluded that of its seven standards , harding failed to meet five the mission and expectations for student learning , curriculum , instruction , assessment and leadership and organization \( the other two areas evaluated were school resources for learning and community resources for learning \) school works , a massachusetts consulting firm , is working with harding to find solutions the followup committee also developed a strategic plan with several goals to tackle , including ensuring a safe and secure facility and a frequent examination of the effectiveness of the curriculum the first goal , however , is to hire a principal by march kenneth henrici , the assistant superintendent , has been the acting principal since edward goldstone was reassigned in september to become the city s director for alternative education after the new england association cited a lack of parental involvement as one of the school s problems , harding secured a 25 , 000 grant to build a resource center for parents the association also said harding needed more afterschool programs several extracurricular clubs have been added , including a physical fitness club the commitment is there to address the recommendations and get off probation as soon as possible and become a better school because of it , mr henrici said the school is down to business nicholas yanosy , an english teacher at the school for 33 years and a member of the followup committee , said it would not be easy to make the necessary changes with 1 , 300 students , 120 teachers and a 1525 million budget , harding is the second largest of the three high schools in bridgeport the school , built in 1924 , was cited for several building deficiencies , too , such as a faulty heating system and harding s gymnasium was closed for the first three weeks of the year because of a leaky roof that led to a warped floor the city is considering a plan to build a new school in 10 years harding , situated on central avenue , is surrounded by housing complexes , a hospital and a thoroughfare ambulances and buses whiz by during the day as students blast radios while sitting on walls across the street the school was also cited for its lack of technology programs , but the building s electrical system may not even handle additional computers , mr yanosy said he added that many parents do not visit the school in the evening because of crime it s an area where there has been drug trafficking in the past and there have been assaults , mr yanosy said we have all the innercity problems though the number of recommendations for improvements in the report clearly outnumbered the commendations , mr yanosy said there were plenty of bright spots the school was commended for its health and careers magnet program , library services and willingness to engage students last year two students won state awards for science fair projects at first i felt bad because i did n't really understand what it was all about , raphaeleta gibson , 18 , a senior and student representative to the board of education , said of the probation but i understand they are trying to do their best to help us i was always a motivated student and i still am and though the dropout rate at harding is still high at 25 percent , the number is decreasing two years ago there were 125 graduates from an initial freshmen class of 500 students last year there were 240 graduates from a freshman class of 500 students mr henrici said the rate of graduates who go on to college increased from 61 percent four years ago to 78 percent last year and he recalled how two immigrant students in his lowlevel english class for ninth graders went on to become valedictorians i see that this place works and it works miracles sometimes , mr henrici said so we have some places we need to grow in we 'll do it photos harding students carry on despite the school s probationary status left , leslie carter , a sophomore gladia ricot , far left , and dalal zeineddin , seniors who placed 2nd in last year s state science fair kenneth henrici , acting principal at harding , says there is a commitment to make improvements

middle township a summer squall has rushed in , and it does n't seem like a good business day for pat tirotta , who has been behind the counter since 3 am except for the hour he spent at church on this sunday morning looks like a bad day , said mr tirotta , who after 37 years behind the same lunch counter knows a dog of a day when he sees one they 're all leaving the island , but they 'll be back they come back they know what i have is unique what mr tirotta has on the road into stone harbor is one of the last of the foodandbait shacks at the jersey shore only a generation ago , the causeways leading to the barrier islands were dotted with these ramshackle takeoutandtackle joints but land values have soared even on the mainland and most of these leantos have been replaced either by bigger businesses or , more likely , condominium developments shoehorned onto a stretch of sandy property but slow business day or not , the 81yearold mr tirotta who has been here since lyndon johnson staked his claim to the democratic presidential nomination just up the coast in atlantic city is n't selling any time soon i went to my doctor and he said , 'you should never stop working , pat , ' said mr tirotta i'm here at 3 , or at least by 5 , every day , winter and summer , and i never close before 4 it keeps me moving and my mind working i tell stories and do my work that s the secret of my health so the proprietor of pat s lunch dispenses homemade soup , mostly stuff from the sea there s seafood chowder and lobster bisque and maryland crab chowder and italian wedding soup and , as the huge red crab sign outside says in bold white lettering , she crab soup nobody does that , only me , he said shecrab is sweet , it s different but it s a lot of work shelling and picking and cooking it just right i do these things because you have to be different than on the island , he went on , pointing with his thumb , almost derisively , just eastward through the rain people come to the shore to eat seafood and , except for the fancy places , they keep serving them pizza and chicken i even stopped doing hoagies because you can get them at acme or wawa you 've got to be different , you just have to be mr tirotta came to his station along stone harbor boulevard in a couple of stages he had been in europe during world war ii , landing at normandy on dday and finishing up nearly two years later after the war he returned home to south philadelphia in search of a wife , who had to meet four criteria she had to be catholic , italian , a good cook and a nonsmoker it did n't take long not too long after he came home he went to a party and met frances parisi he asked her to dance , and the girl from wildwood a place he had never even heard of told him to make the twohour bus trip to visit her he never looked back i came and she took me all the way from atlantic city to cape may in her car , he said i loved it it was god s country so he came and settled , and his new fatherinlaw set him up in in a restaurant in north wildwood in the winter , he worked for a plumber , but the plumber retired in 1966 so mr tirotta bought the shack on stone harbor boulevard , a few miles to the north frankly , i wanted to work by myself , he said i did n't want anyone in my way , even my wife , whom i love dearly but she comes here and tells me i should charge more for bait or do things this or that way i like it better my own way on this particular stormy sunday morning , one customer , vince franzeo , said he liked it mr tirotta s way , too i came in here one day to buy some tackle and i got hooked , said mr franzeo , who publishes real estate guides and lives several miles to the north in seaville now i'm here a couple times a week with that , he chomps on a cheese steak after his seafood chowder there is no one who makes a better cheese steak , he says and he tells great stories , about world war ii and all , but about anything and the soups , mr franzeo goes on like the seinfeld soup nazi , he wo n't sell it to you unless you taste it first the soups are not cheap 5 a bowl or 18 a quart , but he does n't stint on ingredients there is lowfat milk in his white soups and real clams , crab and lobster in the chowders he says it costs him 110 to make 25 quarts of soup , which in season he sells in two or three days he also makes mainestyle lobster rolls , which he sells for 755 he learned about them four years ago on a rare florida vacation i was just talking with this guy from maine who has a stand like mine , said mr tirotta he says , 'you have traffic by your place \? ' i said , 'yes , lots' he says , 'then do lobster rolls like i do and you wo n't regret it' he was right , but lobster s expensive still , no one else does it , so i do mr tirotta is proud of his children his son is a lieutenant with the north wildwood fire department and his daughter is a family therapist in woodbury but he would like a grandchild to take over the business , but none of his are close to 18 i wonder if i can hold on another 10 years before that happens , he said but every penny i can save goes to their college funds they will all have educations because of this place and if they listen to their grandfather , they 'll hear some great stories two summers ago , a guy comes in here and says , 'i'm a chef from new york , and i came here for one reason i heard about your soups' so i let him have a taste of one soup he shakes his head soup no 2 shakes his head soup no 3 shakes his head same thing with the fourth so i figure he does n't like them that s life but then on the fifth soup , he smiles and says , 'i 'll be back' everyone in the place gives him a hand and he goes out two weeks later , he s back with a huge cooler and buys 20 quarts , 10 of the shecrab and 10 of the bisque 'i'm going to sell this for 26 a quart you should come to new york you 'd make a mint , he says but i'm happy here , mr tirotta concludes no one has ever told me what i do is n't good photo pat tirotta has been operating pat s lunch , on the road to stone harbor , for 37 years \( donna connor for the new york times \)
ban taling chan , thailand if the thai government gets its way , a new pipeline will soon appear on the white sand beach here , carrying natural gas from beneath the south china sea across thailand to malaysia it will bring energy for southeast asia and thousands of new industrial jobs for southern thailand that is what ariya maday is afraid of we want our way of life , said ms ariya , one of roughly 5 , 500 muslim villagers who live in the taling chan district we do n't want to change and work in industry to many traditional muslims here , the project represents the intrusion of a kind of globalization they have sought to keep at bay it is only the latest in a growing number of disputes that have inflamed conflicts between discontented local residents of villages scattered across southeast asia and government officials bent on modernizing their countries by forging closer links to their neighbors and the wider global economy to block construction , the villagers here on the kra isthmus linking thailand with malaysia , about 450 south of bangkok have put up a makeshift stockade where they convene for lectures on energy , pollution and globalization the teachins have worked so far the 500 million trans thaimalaysia pipeline has been delayed so long that malaysian officials are considering a new route that would bypass thailand that might help taling chan delay the wider effects of industrial development but it would also set back a project aimed at helping the region better compete in the world economy the planned pipeline is part of a grid of crossborder gas connections that the association of southeast asian nations , or asean , envisions as a way to tie its economies more closely together conceived in 1990 , the idea of a network of pipelines moving natural gas from sources in malaysia , indonesia and elsewhere in the region to much of southeast asia gained new impetus during last year s surge in oil prices officials hope it will reduce the reliance on middle east oil and promote the use of the more environmentally friendly natural gas i see it as an imperative , said leon codron , chief executive of singapore petroleum globalization has to mean a better life for everyone that can only come if there s energy available but to villagers like ms ariya , with little hope for middleclass status , the globalization process mostly seems to benefit city people at their expense for asean s leaders , the standoff at ban taling chan typifies the challenges they face from those who see little to be gained from joining the rush to industrialize china s rise as a rival for trade and investment has awakened asean nations to the need to erase economic boundaries but national interests , and disputes including separatist movements and piracy , hinder the european unionstyle cooperation needed to make projects like the gas grid work with its estimated cost ranging from 8 billion to 30 billion it looks like something that would be very powerful in terms of regional economic development , said patrick l meyer , president of conoco indonesia but when you get way down close to it and you start looking at it from whichever country you happen to be in , it s more complicated than that there are already three crossborder pipelines the first was built from malaysia to singapore in 1992 in 1998 , unocal and totalfinaelf of france laid one from fields off the burmese coast 403 miles across rebel territory and a national forest to thailand this year , sembcorp gas of singapore began receiving gas through a 400 million pipeline from indonesian fields operated by conoco , gulf oil and premier oil of britain nearly 400 miles away in the south china sea when gas was discovered in southeast asia in the 1960 s , it was still used mainly for heating and of little use in the tropics i can remember when you 'd ask customers if they wanted to buy natural gas and they 'd say , 'what s natural gas \? ' said thomas e fisher , senior vice president for commercial affairs at unocal the oil crisis of 197374 changed that new , more efficient gasfired generators made natural gas not only a cleaner alternative to oil and coal for power plants but often cheaper , too southeast asia now uses gas to generate about 40 percent of its electricity , more than any other fuel unocal counts on southeast asian gas for onethird of its revenue conoco is also benefiting we had been a small part of conoco s profitability for many years , mr meyer said that s changing quite quickly even so , gas use varies widely while the philippines uses almost none , thailand derives 70 percent of its electricity from gas and fears a shortage if it does not find more a catch22 situation hinders new production companies will not explore gas fields until they have lined up buyers buyers will not commit until they are guaranteed supply as a result , most gas in southeast asia is supplied under 25to30year contracts in the united states , gas contracts typically span a year or less

broadway , the golden years jerome robbins and the great choreographerdirectors , 1940 to the present by robert emmet long illustrated 312 pp new york continuum 35 how will jerome robbins be remembered , other than as one of the most feared and hated men in show business \? nowadays , most people probably think of him as a maker of ballets , with a nod to west side story but before 1969 , when he choreographed dances at a gathering for the new york city ballet , robbins was far more widely known for his work on broadway three decades after he turned his back on commercial theater to throw in his lot with george balanchine , his hit list continues to astonish on the town , the king and i , peter pan , west side story , gypsy , fiddler on the roof these are only the best remembered of the many musicals that displayed the robbins touch robbins did more than choreograph the last four of those shows he directed them , too he was n't the first choreographer to double in that capacity , but he was the first to do it memorably well , so much so that others who followed him aspired to the same degree of creative control , and in a few cases got it out of him evolved the choreographerdirector , a strange fourlegged beast whose life and times have now been chronicled by robert emmet long , a writer on american literature and the performing arts though the careers of agnes de mille , bob fosse , gower champion , michael bennett and tommy tune are discussed at length in broadway , the golden years , it is robbins who gets by far the most space three chapters and 82 pages and with good reason he was , in long s words , the essential innovator , the fierce bearer of light to put it less fulsomely and more specifically , robbins sought to turn the humble musical comedy into something approaching a totally unified work of art richard rodgers and oscar hammerstein ii had already moved in this direction by writing integrated shows like oklahoma ! and carousel , in which songs arose naturally out of the dramatic action instead of interrupting it it was robbins who took the next step , treating his productions as what richard wagner called a gesamtkunstwerk , a theatrical presentation whose every aspect songs , staging , choreography , d cor was conceived from the outset as part of an organic and indissoluble totality the dance critic arlene croce , never a wholehearted robbins fan , called gypsy the best broadway show i ever saw a masterpiece of poetic theater and radical design as much as anything else , this radicalism was a function of his longing for absolute theatrical unity it makes sense that it was robbins who first tried to stage musicals in this way , since that was more or less how he operated in his parallel life as a ballet choreographer whenever you watch a performance of fancy free , you are hearing a score by leonard bernstein and seeing a set by oliver smith , both as essential to the overall effect of the dance as is the dancing itself and both tailored to robbins s precise specifications even if you got the notion to mount your own updated version \( set in vietnam , say , or with the three sailors played by women \) , the robbins trust would n't let you do it , because that would n't be fancy free a robbins ballet is more than just the sum of its excruciatingly wellrehearsed steps it is a package deal , with one man in sole charge of the packaging having become accustomed to that kind of power in the world of high art , robbins sought to wield it on broadway as well , and in time he got pretty much what he wanted in west side story , long writes , robbins blurs the line between dance and dramatic action , so that it is hard to say where one ends and the other begins in fact , it went deeper than that even when working with such strongwilled collaborators as bernstein , arthur laurents and stephen sondheim , he was the part who shaped the whole it stood to reason that other choreographers would want to do as robbins did , but none had his familiarity with the larger world of art , so their conceptions were inevitably more modest in scope bob fosse came closest , and was probably better at directing actors robbins could never have made a film like cabaret but his jazzbased choreographic vocabulary was too constricting to allow for continued growth \( looking at fosse s dances today , one feels he was never more than a step or two away from selfparody \) gower champion , who came from the world of ballroom dance , was all too aware of his own limitations long quotes marge champion , gower s wife and partner according to marge , he 'absolutely revered jerry robbins , ' while being the first to acknowledge that robbins could move easily from the commercial theater to ballet theater , unlike himself who , as he said , 'could only make shows' the clumsiness of this sentence is also indicative of the limitations of broadway , the golden years , which is earnest and thorough but lacking in flair nor does long seem to know a great deal about dance , a deficiency that is significant but not entirely disqualifying \( you do n't have to know swan lake from sleeping beauty in order to write about tommy tune \) in any case , the reader is likely to come away wondering whether the vogue of the choreographerdirector may be less an apotheosis , as long suggests , than an aberration certainly there have been very few choreographers who were fully comfortable in both roles even robbins had virtually no success directing straight plays as for his dream of the musical as wagnerian gesamtkunstwerk , it seems clear that he gave up on it after fiddler on the roof , not because he could n't make it work but because it was too evanescent a basis on which to build a legacy largescale theatrical productions are too complex to be revived in more than an approximate way in the long run , they leave nothing behind but stardust memories the original gypsy may have been the best broadway show arlene croce ever saw , but if you did n't see it , you missed it \( except for the television version of peter pan , none of robbins s broadway shows have ever been filmed successfully or revived in anything remotely resembling their original form \) by moving uptown to lincoln center , robbins gave himself a shot at immortality the number of people who saw the original gypsy dwindles daily , but if you want to see fancy free or afternoon of a faun or dances at a gathering , all you have to do is buy a ticket unlike the hit shows that made him rich and famous , these intimate , intensely personal works of choreographic art were built to last and did photo the young jerome robbins , center , in a rehearsal \( from broadway , the golden years \)
it is rare that a lawsuit is filed against a trade association by a company in its own industry but last month , that is what happened when the accounting firm of bdo seidman accused the american institute of certified public accountants of violating federal antitrust laws by setting up a forprofit subsidiary that , according to the firm , competes unfairly against some of the association s members last week the battle continued as lawyers for the institute filed a motion to dismiss bdo seidman s complaint , arguing that even if the accounting firm s contentions were accurate , no laws had been broken the lawsuit was the latest evidence of dissension within the accounting industry , with some accountants objecting to the institute s initiatives , including the forprofit company , cpa2biz inc earlier this year , the institute endured withering criticism when it proposed a new credential , then dubbed cognitor , intended to open new markets to accountants the name drew ridicule and many accountants warned that the credential would make accountants vulnerable to competition from professionals in other industries in its lawsuit , bdo seidman argues that cpa2biz , which operates a web site that allows accountants to buy products and services to help them run their businesses , has illegal monopoly power because it has exclusive access to the institute s lists of its members in addition , cpa2biz has the advantage of the institute s endorsement , said scott m univer , bdo seidman s general counsel we supply those kinds of things , software and other kinds of services , he said none of our stuff comes with the aicpa seal of approval the institute and cpa2biz contend in their motion that bdo seidman s complaint is an attempt to shield itself from a competitionenhancing business enterprise the assertions by bdo seidman do not describe violations of antitrust law , the motion says an institute spokeswoman said that its membership lists were available to anyone we are a distributor , said brett prager , president and chief executive officer of cpa2biz he noted that the company also provided access to publications on the accounting industry and information about continuing professional education programs what we are trying to do is offer a wide array of products to the cpa profession underlying the antitrust suit , which seeks a court order restraining cpa2biz but no damages , is a deeper , ethical concern , some accountants say accountants who use the cpa2biz web site have discounts in purchasing products from specific companies , some of which have invested in cpa2biz in some cases accountants can pass those discounts on to clients , and that means that accountants may be at least perceived as having an interest in recommending that their customers use particular products or services the institute s other controversial move , the new credential , was intended to address concerns that fewer people were becoming accountants the credential would be open to professionals who took a test that would be less technical than current cpa exams the proposal touched off much controversy and several state accountants' associations have voiced fierce opposition to the idea one of the things that accountants have done is move into the consulting business , and one of the advantages they have is a cpa , said louis grumet , executive director of the new york state society of certified public accountants if consultants can in turn compete with accountants for some new credential , that will mean unwelcome competition , he said why in god s name would you pay your dues money to an organization to create a competing credential \? the institute has sent out a letter to all of its members asking them to return ballots by dec 28 approving the new credential , which would be administered by a new organization whose name may be a slight improvement on cognitor the international institute of strategic business professionals , or iisbp just rolls off the tongue , does n't it \? asked one accountant in virginia , who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation by the institute just like 'cognitor'
sio , burkina faso that fateful third night his younger brother s stomach cramps failed to ease , despite heavy doses of traditional african medicine , modou di took him to the infirmary , some three miles away , in the next village there , as he remembers it , the nurse immediately admitted his brother , and he went about looking for a relative to borrow a towel but when he returned to the infirmary shortly afterward , modou , an illiterate 30yearold peasant , was thunderstruck to see that his brother had been transferred to the maternity ward and had given birth to a baby boy i thought to myself , modou said , i brought my little brother to the infirmary and i was going back home with a sister and a nephew i was in a panic perhaps no one will ever know the full story of how modou s younger sibling , hamidou , had lived a life as a man only to be exposed as a woman what is clear is that the turn of events has disrupted this small village , where , as in the rest of rural africa , the lines between men and women are drawn rigidly raised as a boy in sio , privy to all of the village s male initiation rites , hamidou di found himself , just shy of 18 , transformed into sita , a young mother privy to none of the village s female secrets it was the equivalent , as one villager put it , of starting life over from zero the events here in sio , an obscure village of some 300 inhabitants and 20 miles from the nearest paved road , even reached ouagadougou , the capital of this landlocked corner of west africa the government newspaper , sidwaya , carried an article with photographs of mother and son , souleymane , shortly after his birth on feb 6 the prevailing sentiment outside sio was that the full details have yet to emerge sita has been talking with reserve the baby s father has fled the villagers , too , are guarding their secrets in this village , as in any other village in africa , people will not reveal everything , said alassane pim , the prefect of the region every village has its secrets a relentlessly cheerful and energetic man , mr pim was reassigned from southern burkina faso to this region just a few months before sita s story came to light like many administrators in former french colonies , he takes his bailiwick seriously , referring to this area as mine maybe because he was new , maybe because he was naturally inquisitive , the prefect has thrown himself with detectivelike zeal into uncovering some of sio s , and sita s , secrets mr pim made his observations on a recent afternoon inside his house in datomo , the site of the infirmary and maternity ward , as his wife , miline , sat sewing last time i saw him her , the prefect said , as his wife chuckled without looking up , i noticed she had pierced her earlobes i also noticed that she had stopped doing what is considered men s work for example , she no longer rides donkey carts only boys , you see , ride donkey carts officially , the prefect had gathered this much there was no birth certificate for sita , a common oversight in africa but during a census in 1996 , sita , still known as hamidou , had been registered as a male resident of sio but we cannot rely on official records to get to the truth , the prefect said sio is a very , very poor village they have nothing there if they receive a letter , they must send for someone in the next village to read it after a drive on a bumpy dirt road through grassland , sio emerged in a clearing , a collection of mudbrick houses children swarmed in front of one of the bigger houses , oblivious to the scorching sun , as a handful of village elders went inside the prefect was warmly greeted by one of the few villagers to speak french , fl douin di , 48 , who thus acted as a delegate welcome , please sit , you have come to see our sita , the delegate said , grinning and betraying , even at a distance of three feet , an overindulgence of palm wine the delegate s fluency in french diminished as the effects of the alcohol settled inside his body soon sita came in , followed by her mother and two older brothers sita and her mother sat on a short bench , the older woman refraining from looking directly , as was village custom , at the men in the room asked to tell her story , sita began a sparse account that was frequently interrupted by others in the room when i was born , i was named sita but then my father realized i was a boy and renamed me hamidou the mother , badoin di , now in her 60 s , recalled she had always been certain that her baby was a daughter central to the conundrum was the medical oddity the baby had been born with , two sexual organs , one of which depending on the eye of the beholder was more developed than the other but my husband thought it was a boy , and what could i say against my husband \? she said sita went on , explaining that things changed four years ago when she began menstruating i realized that i was not a boy but a girl yet sita kept the change a secret and underwent the initiation rites into manhood , going into the forest with other boys and dancing with masks somehow one of her friends discovered the truth a relationship began sita was able to keep her pregnancy hidden , perhaps because the villagers did not want to face an uncomfortable truth , perhaps because she stuck to her normal routine , harvesting millet and sorghum through the ninth month until the stomach pains i thought it was shameful to be pregnant because everyone thought i was a boy , sita said but after the birth i was satisfied now i would be recognized as a woman the difficulty was that sita knew nothing about being a woman in sio she did not know how to handle her child , who fell into her mother s care she was unable to carry the child strapped to her back , as african women do she could not grind millet , she could not prepare a staple sauce made from baobab leaves , and she could barely cook rice she had given away all her men s clothes to her brother , and had only the one blouse and wrap her mother had given her she ca n't even tie the wrap properly around her , the delegate snickered sita said i am a woman now , and my wish is to find a husband but i have no clothes to attract a man sita has no role in sio her male friends no longer visit the women shun her worst of all , the baby s father a cousin fled no one knew to where asked whether she missed him , sita said she did not she s afraid to admit it , the delegate said tell the truth in life , you must always tell the truth the prefect , who had remained silent until then , perked up at the mention of truth the delegate is a philosopher , the prefect said with a smile there was a final , disturbing matter the prefect wanted to discuss , privately , one that had added yet another layer of mystery to the case early in april , less than two months after his birth , sita s baby was found dead in sio the prefect followed sita and her family to their mudbrick house a few yards away , and closed the door behind them eventually the prefect came out shaking his head , still troubled , he confessed later , by the rumors of an unnatural death of the infant that the villagers had considered a curse the child died , in curious circumstances , the prefect said later , inside the car on the drive out of sio they said he had been constipated and they gave him dried herbs and tried to purge him the next morning he was dead it s strange , he added at this moment , we do not have the whole truth about what occurred in this village photo the family that became the talk of their village in burkina faso from left sona di his brother , modou his sister , sita , who was raised as a boy his mother , badoin sita gave birth the father fled , and the baby died \( norimitsu onishi the new york times \) map of burkina faso highlighting sio the villagers in tiny sio can say they have seen everything now
there is no sign in the lobby , and the placard outside the elevator that opens up to the 18th floor of the madison avenue building identifies the office that fills the floor simply as morris , carrick guma , a political consulting firm behind the door are 4 , 000 bustling square feet of computers , telephones , television sets , videotape machines , desks and workers , a warren of offices with crystalclear views of the world trade center to the south and the empire state building rising to the west save for a few photographs on the walls , and boxes of campaign leaflets stacked on the floor , there would be no way to tell that this impressive midtown office serves as more than the headquarters of one of new york s premier political consulting firms but these days it has become nothing less than the headquarters of the mayoral campaign of alan g hevesi , the city comptroller , who is the close friend and highprofile client of one of the firm s named partners , hank morris in the last month , this madison avenue office and mr morris have become a symbol of , in different quarters of new york s democratic party , either the ruthless exploitation of the city s campaign finance law by an unscrupulous campaign or the singleminded frugality of mr morris in that view , it is seen as evidence of his success at slashing campaign costs to devote mr hevesi s limited campaign budget to television advertisements mr hevesi s opponents have pressed the city s campaign finance board to rule on whether mr morris is unfairly providing cutrate office and consulting services to his friend , the man he wants to make new york s next mayor beyond that , the dispute over mr hevesi s novel arrangement with mr morris suggests the difficulty that proponents of stricter campaign finance regulations across the nation have faced over a generation of trying to restrict the influence of money on politics since watergate , virtually every attempt to regulate campaign contributions and spending has been stymied by some politicians or consultants who have intrepidly poked a hole in the system including , it now seems , the new york city system , which its supporters have described as the best in the nation the outcome of this latest dispute could have a farreaching effect on the way the campaign in new york is played out over the next two months , depending on what the campaign finance board does , as well as on any future attempts by governments to enact campaign finance laws already , city officials are discussing whether the city s campaign finance law needs repair , much the same way some members of congress have been struggling to curb the use of socalled softmoney contributions in the federal campaign system in this case , while mr hevesi s three major democratic rivals have gone about the traditional process of renting headquarters and hiring staffs , ranging from 12 to 23 people , the hevesi campaign is getting by on four paid employees \( up from one a few weeks ago \) who work out of mr morris s madison avenue suite the political implications of this arrangement could be highly significant the campaign finance system limits spending to 55 million for the primary election mr morris s success at holding down administrative costs , in sharp contrast with his relatively freespending rivals , has allowed mr hevesi to spend 11 million on television advertisements already and still have about 36 million available toward the 55 million cap , about as much as his democratic rivals , none of whom have yet broadcast a single television commercial but the legal implications of the arrangement are far less clear mr morris asserts that he is scrupulously adhering to the rules of the city s campaign finance system , and argues that he is allowed to volunteer his services to mr hevesi but mr hevesi s rivals suggest that he is enjoying an unfair advantage in the form of potentially subsidized services we pay for what we get , said fernando ferrer , the bronx borough president and democratic mayoral candidate do i have friends who would give me space for free \? yes would i consider that a problem with the law \? yes so do i take it \? no it is really that simple peter f vallone , the city council speaker and an author of the campaign finance law , also expressed strong concern , saying the whole point of the law was to make it a level playing field so that money does n't determine the outcome so if you can find a loophole , then the law is not doing what the law is supposed to be doing the third major democratic candidate , mark green , the public advocate , declined a request to be interviewed on the subject mr hevesi s democratic rivals are paying far more than he has in the last six months for costs associated with their political consultants , campaign headquarters and other basic campaign expenses from midjanuary through midjuly , mr green spent 620 , 000 on consultants , fundraising , office expenses , postage , office rent and campaign workers , while mr ferrer spent 377 , 571 and mr vallone spent 390 , 378 , according to a computer analysis of campaign finance records mr hevesi , by comparison , spent only 83 , 568 for similar expenses during that same period still , the latest campaign finance reports and some details provided by officials with mr morris s firm suggest that the disparity is not as great as some democrats have suggested

wellton , ariz , may 24 local and federal officials painted a devastating picture today of a smuggling operation that killed at least 14 young mexican immigrants in arizona , saying a coyote had apparently abandoned more than two dozen men in one of the country s most brutal and desolate stretches of desert on saturday with little water and no preparation a dozen who survived the ordeal , in 115degree temperatures , were in a hospital in yuma today one of them , a 16yearold , was in critical condition though dozens die every year trying to cross illegally into arizona from mexico , this was the area s worst single incident in memory in 1980 , 13 illegally immigrating salvadorans died in arizona border officials said today that in years of patrolling this region they had rarely found immigrants in such desolate surroundings , many of them more than 30 miles from any road or structure at a time when the heat had shot up every year , more than 100 , 000 immigrants are caught crossing the border illegally near yuma but usually on better marked and less dangerous routes some relief groups organized by churches have set up water stands at popular crossing points , jugs of water marked by blue flags , but none were near the place where the latest deaths occurred , border patrol officials said it was dirt , some rock , just a few small trees , said sheriff ralph e ogden of yuma county , who added that the temperatures on the desert floor had risen to close to 130 degrees they did not appear to have any water when we found them , sheriff ogden said some had torn off some of their clothing the bodies we found were already decomposing the dead were found in clusters miles apart the group had apparently split up after traveling about 30 miles north from a mexican truck stop just across the border this morning two more immigrants were found , one dead and the other barely alive border patrol officials said agents were tracking what they thought was one more person heading east perhaps one of the coyotes , or smugglers , or a guide mexican consular officials said at a news conference in yuma today that the mexican police were questioning a suspected smuggler in mexico but had made no arrests the mexican authorities said they thought other men had been involved and were searching for them all of the latest victims were male , apparently between the ages of 16 and 35 all were from mexico , the officials said , and at least some had come from the state of veracruz they were found spread across an area that included the barry m goldwater air force range and the cabeza prieta national wildlife refuge , southeast of yuma border patrol officials said that they had not had a chance to question all the survivors but that typically they would have paid their smugglers more than 1 , 000 each in this case they appeared to have been led to a remote stretch of the fence separating the two countries and then told to head north to interstate 8 the highway is about 70 miles from the border twentysix people died in the border sector near yuma in the fiscal year that ended sept 30 , and four more died in the region before this incident , said maurice moore , a border patrol spokesman the officials said this smuggling operation could not have produced any other result there s not much around there except the sand and bushes with thorns on them , said glen payne , the agent in charge of the border patrol office here , which found the first of the dead and dying men during a routine patrol yesterday morning there s nothing for like 30 miles in any direction the initial sighting was about 10 am wednesday , about 30 miles north of the border four men were found badly dehydrated , and they told agents that 22 others were behind them just before 1 pm , 17 people were found just to the south by a marine helicopter crew , which airlifted them to a hospital ten were already dead , and one more died before the helicopter landed at 1 45 pm two more bodies were found about 11 miles farther south then , at 5am today , two more men were discovered , about four miles south of the first sighting one had already died the other , the 16yearold , was near death but made it to a hospital , where he was in intensive care doctors at the hospital said that even the healthiest of the men would probably be in the hospital at least a week and that they all might suffer permanent kidney damage many people involved in trying to ease the tough conditions at the border said today that they were outraged at the loss of life , with some arguing that federal policies to stanch the flow of illegal immigrants near urban areas , a clinton administration policy , operation gatekeeper , had led to such deaths by pushing the illegal border crossers to more and more remote areas we knew this was coming , said isabel garcia , a lawyer in tucson and a cofounder of the arizona border rights project , an umbrella group of 60 organizations that assists immigrants we 've been forewarning , lobbying , begging , cajoling , protesting , shouting , praying we 've done everything to bring attention to this very deadly law enforcement strategy that has been used by the border patrol of driving people into the most remote areas , where they have to know this will occur jay michaels , a ranch manager in southeastern arizona , said that people in his region were shocked by the news and that he was putting water and relief supplies at remote spots on his ranch for any immigrants who might be wandering across the land what you hear people around here saying is that these are not illegal immigrants , they 're humans , and we have to treat them that way , he said johnny williams , regional director for the immigration and naturalization service , said rescuers had searched an area the size of delaware if you have n't been to that area and you want to know what isolation is , go to this corner of the desert , mr williams said over all , deaths along the united statesmexican border have increased about fivefold since the operation began in 1995 last year , the deadliest on record , more than 400 people died crossing the border with mexico , and so far this year there has been about one death a day today s headline in the tucson paper said , 'desert kills 12 , ' said the rev bob carney , pastor of st luke s roman catholic church in douglas , ariz , which provides sanctuary to illegal immigrants and places water at remote paths used by immigrants i believe that it is our policy that killed them , and that this is a failed policy mr williams rejected that assertion and said federal officials were doing everything possible both to protect the border and protect the illegal immigrants , particularly from ruthless smugglers what is the common ground is smugglers , mr williams said it s one of the most horrible deaths that can occur for a human being , he added it s a grisly , terrible , terrible death photo

looking good male body image in modern america by lynne luciano illustrated 259 pp new york hill wang 25 that men are now sized up on the basis of their appearances , that this scrutiny has brought on an epidemic of anxiety and has come to oppress men much as it has oppressed women , and that men have consequently begun paying more attention to their looks none of this will come as news to anyone who has been awake for the past 30 years the stuff of lynne luciano s looking good is inextricably woven into the texture of our daily lives , and many of the changes she describes , though drastic over the long term , have come about so gradually that we 've simply taken them in stride all the more reason , then , to welcome a book that could give us some insight into the cumulative cultural weight of such phenomena as hair transplants , penile implants , bodybuilding and viagra it s a juicy subject , male body image in modern america , with a picturesque cast of characters among them , charles atlas , hugh hefner and john wayne bobbitt an assistant professor of history at the university of california , dominguez hills , luciano says that her research spanned 300 books and more than 2 , 000 articles christopher lasch s theory of narcissism the melding of reality and illusion brought on by the rampant consumption of images , the relentless attempts to validate oneself in light of the standards they perpetrate provides the solid foundation for her book , which is organized by decade what luciano does best is to synthesize information , much of it from disparate sources , both highbrow and pop the result can be entertaining and intelligent , as in her analysis of the playboy philosophy , by which the role of breadwinner was deferred rather than abdicated , or of the shift in advertisements for men s underwear , from an emphasis on washandwearability , which catered to wives , to calvin klein s direct appeal to the men themselves in many ways , looking good brings to mind naomi wolf s book the beauty myth and other recent crusades that set out to expose the various means by which our culture of consumerism works to stifle women s selfrespect luciano spares no grisly detail in elaborating the preposterous lengths men now go to in order to maintain their viability in the world , including remedies for hair loss that sound like fertile material for comedy skits one procedure in which balloons are inserted under the scalp to stretch skin where the hair still grows , another in which snaps are attached to the skull to anchor a toupee whether the blame for all this physical and emotional anguish lies with those dastardly marketing types , who have succeeded in persuading men that they are inadequate and over the hill , or with men , for being so gullible as to believe them , is hard to say regardless , luciano seems determined to portray men as desperate , fanatical and deluded , and nowhere is this bent more obvious than in her sensationalistic depiction of bodybuilding nutritionists agree that even average americans consume twice as much protein as they need bodybuilders take in 20 to 30 times too much , and highprotein intake can drastically shorten life span , she alleges , evidently oblivious of the extreme demands that hypertrophy , the process of increasing muscle mass , makes on the body in fact , the elevated protein requirements of athletes engaged in intensive strength training have been well established by sports medicine research , and standard formulas exist luciano blames excess protein intake for many of the health risks associated with the sport , when in fact most problems can be traced to the use of anabolic steroids her claims that bodybuilders train six to seven hours a day , that they eat no more than 1 , 400 calories a day , that it is virtually mandatory that they reach such a state of physical overload that they vomit and pass out while performing their routines would be overstated even where the pros are concerned , and this book , to make its case , ought to be focusing on the average guy who has taken up weight training to look better and feel stronger , not the top contenders for mr olympia when it comes to bodybuilders , not even the women who love them escape luciano s disdain the more educated and sexually liberated a woman is , she tells us , the less likely she is to find the atlas physique attractive perhaps because she feels less of a need to be protected by a strong male ! says who \? i could go for arnold , but then i did n't go to grad school there s an irksome irony here , luciano writes \( why irksome \? \) muscles may be symbolic of masculinity , but bodybuilding , with its selfconscious posing and selfdisplay , is oddly reminiscent of stereotypically feminine activities contestants in bodybuilding competitions shave off their body hair and pose covered in makeup to enhance their physical charms their preening , measuring and dieting is more typical of female , not male , behavior elsewhere , luciano establishes that american men spent 3 billion on grooming aids and fragrances in 1997 \( preening \) , that men are undergoing phalloplasty in droves \( measuring \) and that 10 percent of diagnosed bulimia patients are men \( dieting \) , which would suggest that at least some of the behavior we have long presumed to be female is merely human instead surely , in addition to the reasons luciano proposes \( competition in the workplace , midlife crisis \) , men s preoccupations with their looks have lately been legitimized at least in part because feminism has loosened the strictures for both sexes however informally , men and women have worked out a trade women got access to the world of ideas , and men to the realm of appearances luciano would have us believe that these concerns primarily strike men 40 and older as if vanity were a phase i would argue instead that the trend is more widespread and lasting , and that men in their 20 s now have permission to be vain in a way that previous generations did not on more than one occasion in this book some interesting issue pops into view , and luciano keeps on driving , her eyes glued to the road in one instance , a retired clothing manufacturer says that he embarked on a bodybuilding regimen in high school not to attract girls but because of the way it made him feel when you walked down the street , you were a man among men later , discussing men who undergo surgery to enlarge their penises , luciano informs us that most patients suffer from a phenomenon doctors call 'lockerroom syndrome , ' meaning they want larger flaccid penises , rather than larger erect ones , to give themselves greater selfconfidence among men more than 100 pages separate these two remarks , and luciano never comments on them , much less connects them to what extent are men going to all this trouble in order to prove their manhood to one another \? now that would be an irksome irony
the plan was to throw fastballs and eliminate sentiment , so david cone ignored the applause he heard while walking to the mound at yankee stadium for the first inning last night no wave , no tip of the cap , no glance toward the stands he wore a boston uniform , the yankees and their fans were the enemy , the parameters were simple then derek jeter grinned at cone and ducked his head and chuckled as he stepped to the plate , and a small smile ambushed cone s face , briefly cone regained his seriousness , surprised his old friends with his velocity and the quality of his pitches , but he allowed three runs in five innings that was not nearly enough to beat andy pettitte , who pitched eight and a third innings as the yankees thumped boston , 73 jeter went 5 for 5 , including a seventhinning home run , and bernie williams drove in all three runs scored against cone , hitting a tworun homer boston \( 2519 \) is a halfgame ahead of the yankees \( 2520 \) , and today pedro mart nez pitches for the red sox against mike mussina the yankees have won the past four games mart nez has started against them , usually driving up his pitch count early and beating the relievers who follow him it had been a while since cone felt this way before a game , he said , the anxiousness , the anticipation of a big game cone strolled onto the field to prepare for this start about 15 minutes before pettitte ambled to the bullpen , and cone nodded in pettitte s direction and jabbed his glove at mel stottlemyre , his longtime pitching coach with the mets and the yankees but when cone finished warming up and crossed the outfield again , pockets of fans in the growing crowd stood and clapped cone never acknowledged their cheers , keeping his head down as he descended the steps of the visitors' dugout all business i made up my mind to get through the first inning , he said i made a conscious effort to try to block this out over the past couple of seasons , before cone signed with the red sox as a free agent , the yankees often saw him work deep into ballstrike counts , doing everything he could to avoid throwing a fastball over the plate but in the first inning last night , cone challenged them with fastballs a firstpitch strike to chuck knoblauch to open the game , fastballs when he was ahead in the count , instead of splitters or sliders he threw a fastball to paul o'neill for called strike one , threw another 91 miles per hour , about 4 or 5 mph faster than last year and o'neill swung and missed the count was 02 and o'neill almost had to be looking for something off speed , something with crooked movement cone zipped a twoseam fastball that started inside and tailed over the plate , strike three , three pitches cone s mechanics are not much different than they were when he was with the yankees , the pitching hand and glove raised behind his head , rather than in front of him , his whole body driving toward the plate there was a lot more movement on his pitches , however , and he threw a lot of strikes , on 58 of his 85 pitches a cold wind blew fog in from left field , and the yankees' hitters squinted in the mist to see what must have looked like an apparition he had good stuff , tino martinez said good fastball , good split but they got to him in the third inning jeter fisted an inside fastball to center field with one out in the third , and after cone retired o'neill , he fell behind williams , two balls and no strikes williams fouled a high fastball back cone tried throwing another fastball high in the zone , meaning to jam williams but it faded over the plate and williams slammed it through the damp air and into the rightfield stands , a home run that gave the yankees a 21 lead williams bounced around the bases and cone turned on the mound and waited to see a replay on the scoreboard , to ascertain exactly where he made the mistake cone had his best inning in the fourth , dropping down to throw a sidearm fastball to scott brosius and throwing four different pitches on four successive pitches as he struck out alfonso soriano curve , slider , fastball , splitter but his pitch count was at 62 after four innings and he did not last long tim wakefield , whose scheduled start on tuesday was washed away by rain , began warming up in the fifth the yankees added a run in that inning jeter singled to center field , his third hit off cone , and o'neill blooped a single over shortstop , jeter taking third williams grounded to second and jeter scored yankees 3 , red sox 1 cone sat on the boston bench after that halfinning and the pitching coach joe kerrigan told him he was finished for the night cone s head tilted , and he assured kerrigan he still felt strong boston s plan is to bring him along slowly , steadily manager jimy williams did not want to come close to overworking cone in such poor weather , this early in the season kerrigan walked away and cone sagged he had allowed three runs on six hits in five innings , walked none , pitched fine but pettitte was overpowering , allowing only six hits , generating a couple of doubleplay ground balls , completely controlling this game until the ninth , when mike stanton was summoned to get the last two outs cone said he appreciated the applause and understood its meaning but he will not look back now , only ahead , to his next start next week , against the yankees , the enemy inside pitch manny ramirez doubled home two runs in the ninth inning , his third hit of the game and his 55th and 56th runs batted in of the year ramirez is batting 414 jorge posada hit a tworun homer in the eighth inning , ending a streak of 87 homerless atbats photos the yankees' andy pettitte allowed three runs on six hits in eight and a third innings

washington , oct 14 toward the end of his news conference last week , president bush turned to the hard topics of war and sacrifice having commented earlier , as he has done so often since sept 11 , that the american people have got to go about their business and live normal lives , mr bush said that americans were sacrificing when they waited in long lines at airports and at ballparks and he spoke of the profound sacrifice of the friends and families of those who perished in the world trade center and the pentagon those , as he remarked in a moment of rare lyricism , who have lost a piece of their soul presidents and other leaders have for centuries turned to the language of sacrifice to ennoble the harsh experience of war and bestir their countrymen lincoln celebrated it at gettysburg churchill told his beleaguered people in 1940 that more blood , toil , tears and sweat lay ahead in june 1944 , in a dday prayer , franklin d roosevelt called for rededication to god in this hour of great sacrifice in the cold war , john f kennedy said the nation would make any sacrifice pay any price , bear any burden , meet any hardship , support any friend , oppose any foe to assure the survival and the success of liberty as president bush suggested , the loss of blood and treasure in new york has shocked americans into a passionate sense of commitment that is both more widespread and less superficial than most recent fevers of patriotism the new sense of national peril , the erosion of the sense of security the united states has relied on for 200 years , has begotten a new national unity there is no doubt what the mission is making the world safe from terrorism this contrasts sharply with the situation in 1990 , when mr bush s father had difficulty explaining precisely why it was necessary to defend kuwait , whether because of its oil or the strategic importance of the persian gulf or the evil of aggression it is far , far easier to call for sacrifice when the goal is clearly defined and selfevidently worthwhile yet looking forward , mr bush faces a dilemma that none of his precursors encountered he is hemmed in by the very nature of the foe he has vowed to defeat not a nation or an ideology but bands of terrorists , whose goal is to sow enough terror to produce paralysis so the president appeals for normality , which implies giving up little or nothing , and that consorts incongruously with sacrifice , which involves giving up a lot , sometimes life itself shop more , consume more , the nation is told no sacrifice there , especially at firesale prices taxes are to be cut to stimulate the economy , not raised to pay for war hard to see sacrifice there waiting in line and undergoing baggage searches are inconveniences , not sacrifices watching the news conference , one could not help wondering why mr bush chose not to invoke , as examples that others might be called upon to emulate , the heroic firefighters who went to their death in new york in an effort to rescue others , or the burly men who tried to subdue the hijackers of a second plane bound for washington , causing it to crash in pennsylvania the president has at no time attempted to minimize the gravity of the current crisis indeed , in a videotaped speech today to a physicians' group , mr bush called this one of the darkest moments in our history in his news conference , he put forward a plan for american children to contribute dollars earned by washing cars or raking yards to the wretched , malnourished children of afghanistan the idea had the virtue of not only motivating the children and especially their parents but also underlining his contention that the afghan regime , not the people , is the enemy but he has found no way yet to involve the american people as a whole in the campaign that vast majority who were not touched by the sept 11 attacks or the various anthrax scares , who do not serve in the military the danger , over the long term , is loss of interest with much of the war to be conducted out of plain sight by commandos , diplomats and intelligence agents , will a nation that has spent decades in easy selfindulgence stay focused \? the experience of vietnam is instructive lyndon b johnson , sensing the minimal support for the war in vietnam , hesitated to appeal for sacrifice he restricted tours of duty for the military , and he promised the american people that they could have both guns and butter in the midst of prosperity that has been unequaled in this nation , he said defiantly in 1965 , i see no reason for declaring a national emergency , and i rejected that course of action there was no dearth of heroes in vietnam but few who survived were lauded at home , like alvin york in world war i and audie murphy in world war ii , and we remember few if any of the names of those who made what patriotic orators have always called the supreme sacrifice people paid no attention heroes matter the medals awarded to them honor their sacrifices and spread their renown , which in popular wars fire others to emulate their feats , on the battlefield or the home front heroes in the war against terrorism could provide powerful symbols for mr bush in keeping the nation with him what will happen on the battlefields of the next months and years is unclear , of course this is no conventional war but two things seem evident there have already been civilian casualties , and there will be more and there will be american military casualties as well , unlike the war in kosovo in 1999 there , while inflicting widespread casualties not only on enemy troops but also on innocent civilians , the united states and its nato allies set out as a matter of policy to hold themselves harmfree to that end , they eschewed the use of ground troops , of lowflying planes that might have been shot down , even of air drops of food and medicines to refugees in some circumstances to many , that kind of antiseptic , pushbutton warfare seemed ignoble , no matter how fine the cause may have been , precisely because it removed the element of potential selfsacrifice from the cruel equation of combat photos presidents abraham lincoln and john f kennedy both used the language of sacrifice to stir americans and ennoble the experience of war , lincoln at gettysburg and kennedy in the cold war \( associated press \) \( pg b2 \) a national guardsman standing watch yesterday at the entrance to pennsylvania station at 34th street near seventh avenue \( associated press \) \( pg b1 \)
the rulemaking organization for new york state s electricity market warned yesterday that new york would face a dire energy squeeze over the next few years unless new power plants were approved by the state this year and although that message was not new a group of new york city business leaders made much the same point earlier this year the messenger definitely was the new york independent system operator , which issued the report , has been harshly criticized by some consumer groups and energy companies for its management of the state s newly deregulated power market , especially after electricity prices soared last summer even though the weather was cooler than normal today , organization officials said that a looming shortage of supply , which they warned could be felt as early as this summer , was what threatened new yorkers most , not problems with the market itself new york is headed toward a very serious situation unless it acts immediately , the organization s president and chief executive , william j museler , said at a news conference in manhattan mr museler said that the state process for approving new power plants should be streamlined , and that the potential severity of new york s energy situation would depend on whether some of the 85 power plant projects that had been proposed by developers could be approved this year and next how much of that gets built will determine how bad the problem is , he said the organization s report , which projects a shortfall of 400 megawatts of electricity in new york city this summer , also puts the group in the middle of a fierce debate about how much new generation is needed for the state and the city the natural resources defense council , a private conservation group , has estimated that because of incremental additions to the city s power supply beginning last fall , the city faces a relatively modest energy deficit this summer of only 122 megawatts lawyers for some neighborhood groups that have filed suit challenging the placement of emergency generators by the new york power authority in various spots around the city have said that there may be no energy shortfall but a small surplus none of those estimates project that new york city , which faces the most serious energy problems in the state because of transmissionline limitations , will run out of electricity under state rules , new york city must generate at least 80 percent of its needs inside the city the projected shortfall for this summer is the amount of current capacity below that mandated city requirement one megawatt is enough electricity to supply 1 , 000 homes

in the last 12 days , the country has been first traumatized and then saturated by tragic images of the world trade center collapsing , and is now enveloped in the language of war last night s historymaking allstar telecast to raise money for the relief work was shaped by the wise , timely idea that the public was ready for a more eloquent expression of sorrow tom hanks explained that the twohour benefit , called america a tribute to heroes , was a simple show of unity , and though its style had a simple dignity , its reach and ambition were immense , speaking to the global reach of technology and the influence of hollywood celebrity the show was put together in less than a week when the four major networks , abc , cbs , nbc and fox , agreed to broadcast the show without commercials , then offered it to other channels by last night , more than 30 broadcast and cable channels had joined , as different as pbs , comedy central , court tv , showtime , sundance , hbo and hbo latino , as well as 8 , 000 radio stations and several internet sites it will also be seen in more than 200 other countries , including britain , turkey , china and new zealand , where it will be available on tape to be shown in prime time there there has never been anything of this scope or concentration before , and the number of viewers around the world was certain to shatter records it was harder to find a channel not carrying the benefit than one that was \( the disney channel and nickelodeon , programmed for young people , did not join neither did the sports channel espn and some niche cable channels \) the elegiac tone was set at the start by bruce springsteen , who appeared on a new york stage before a bank of candles , as if at a memorial service his face looked stricken as he sang , my city s in grief , accompanying himself on guitar and harmonica there was no host , no audience , no applause and as much as this promised to be a night of stargazing , it turned out to be an evening of comforting music and dryeyed , brief tributes to rescue workers and victims mr hanks appeared next and said , we 're going to try to do something , quoting the people who resisted the hijackers on the flight that crashed in pennsylvania , saving the country from , as he said , an even darker day what followed was a parade of actors and musicians , people who literally needed no introduction they got none , but were instantly recognizable on a similar candlebanked stage in los angeles , george clooney explained that some friends were at the phone banks taking donations , as the camera turned to jack nicholson , whoopi goldberg , al pacino and adam sandler answering phones in front of a flag mr clooney said that the money would be administered by united way and gave the phone number , which spelled tounite perhaps because the show was put together so quickly , its pareddown eloquence was far different from most overproduced tributes the stars and musicians appeared in stark black clothes there was minimal orchestration , and often a pop feel to the music it was not young music \( limp bizkit was the mtvgeneration exception \) but it was not hollywood glitzy either it was middleaged , with u2 and then sting live from london , paul simon in new york singing bridge over troubled water and neil young in los angeles singing john lennon s imagine the comedians were serious jim carrey quoted winston churchill on courage , then told of two rescue workers who carried a woman down more than 60 flights of the world trade center tower robin williams , talked about a survivor of the 1993 world trade center bombing who died last week trying , once again , to rescue others julia roberts spoke of the people who helped save their colleagues after the attack on the pentagon and there was no selfaggrandizing subtext the celebrities did not tell their personal stories kelsey grammer , the star of frasier , quoted john f kennedy s profiles in courage , but did not mention that david angell , the producer of his own show , died on one of the hijacked planes as the stars asked for donations no hard sell was necessary their comments were mercifully free of politics in fact only at the end , when the entire group joined willie nelson in singing america the beautiful , was there a trace of the patriotic tone that has imbued so much of the television coverage since sept 11 even then , the telecast s style was beautiful and elegant rather than rousing , a true tribute to what television can be at its unified best photo among the stars on america a tribute to heroes last night was tom hanks , who called the program a simple show of unity
oakland , calif , jan 14 this place where the oakland raiders play is called the black hole , a pit where teams usually fold but the baltimore ravens put the raiders deep under this afternoon baltimore s offense pinched the raiders and its defense made the raiders gasp , then gag the result was a 163 baltimore victory in the american football conference championship game that placed an emphatic stamp of authenticity on the ravens' vaunted defense no doubt about it this ravens defense is frightening , maddening , stirring , glaring , and is on its way to super bowl xxxv the ravens not the favored raiders will battle the giants for the lombardi trophy on jan 28 in tampa , fla the 62 , 784 raiders fans who boldly and colorfully arrived here today at network associates coliseum left with plenty of tears no doubt , like their beloved raiders , they left convinced that the baltimore defense simply blew this game and their dreams to pieces there s not a whole lot to say except to compliment baltimore , raiders coach jon gruden said and whatever else was left to say , leave it to shannon sharpe , the former tight end of the champion denver broncos , the current baltimore tight end , who talks a big game and backs it up with big plays i asked our defensive coordinator , marvin lewis , how many points he needed today and he said 7 , sharpe said i said , 'you need only 7 points to win the afc championship game \? ' he said 7 i said ok and we got him 16 sharpe got him the first 7 points and lewis was right it was all the ravens' defense needed after a brutal first quarter that ended scoreless , the ravens broke the deadlock with the longest scoring play in postseason history ravens quarterback trent dilfer took a quick drop and threw a quick strike to sharpe , who ran a quick slant , and that was it sharpe caught the football for what looked like a 7 or 8yard gain , but then he split the middle of the raiders' defense and kept running and kept churning after the play was over , after 96 yards had been covered , 11 minutes 8 seconds were left in the second quarter and the ravens had the game s first and only touchdown and , basically , the game it was called 'rip double slant , ' baltimore coach brian billick said when shannon came over , i had to remind him , 'you 're not that fast' sharpe , 31 , an 11thyear player , who weighs 232 pounds , outran the entire raiders secondary , including some very speedy young players like cornerback charles woodson and safety anthony dorsett no matter the angle , no matter the distance , one would believe that over the last 70 yards that woodson or dorsett would have been able to catch sharpe none of the raiders were even close i consider myself pretty fast , but it seemed like i would never get to the end zone , sharpe said trent hit me in stride i was so sick and tired of hearing about the black hole after that score , it was like i took a shovel and covered up the hole you kept hearing the raiders talk all week about this place and their fans , but fans are n't going to win you a football game you never heard them talking too much about their offense or defense , huh \? the raiders' defense did enough but the raiders' offense was buried baltimore s defense settled in after sharpe s score and absolutely snuffed the raiders , denying running lanes to back tyrone wheatley \( 12 carries , 7 yards for the game \) , denying big gains for receiver tim brown \( 5 catches , 48 yards \) and knocking quarterback rich gannon \( 11 completions , 21 attempts , 80 passing yards , 4 sacks and 2 interceptions \) out of the game immediately after sharpe s long touchdown grab with 10 55 left before halftime , gannon was sacked , then fallen upon by the 340pound ravens tackle tony siragusa it aggravated an injury to gannon s nonthrowing shoulder , which he said he sustained on the raiders' first series of the game gannon returned to play a few series in the second half , but he was basically a nonfactor , unable to even scramble as usual , managing only 2 rushing yards our game plan did n't change much , billick said stop the run keep rich from doing too much damage out of the pocket the ravens forced five turnovers \( four interceptions and a fumble recovery \) and they kept coming at the most critical , gameswinging moments cornerback duane starks gained the first of his two interceptions after sharpe s long score , this one thrown by bobby hoying , the raiders' backup quarterback starks made his second pick , this one off gannon , and returned it 35 yards to midfield late in the third quarter to preserve baltimore s 133 lead entering the final quarter early in the fourth quarter , middle linebacker ray lewis recovered a gannon fumble at the oakland 7 that led to matt stover s 21yard field goal and the game s final points after oakland showed some life with hoying moving the ravens from their 14 to the baltimore 12 , ravens linebacker jamie sharper intercepted hoying at the ravens' 2 with 3 41 left in the game shut down bounced dumped into their own black hole the baltimore defense was more than the raiders could handle oakland gained 191 total yards and only 24 rushing yards it became the 36th straight opponent that the baltimore defense has not allowed a 100yard rusher the raiders gained 167 passing yards on each of their first eight drives ran four or fewer plays , and seven of those eight were threeandout drives off the ravens go to the super bowl , the first for art modell in his 40 years as owner of the franchise , previously the cleveland browns modell is close friends with the giants coowner wellington mara , and billick said his closest friend in the coaching fraternity is the giants' jim fassel billick saluted dilfer and modell all i know is that trent has 10 straight wins and he has put us in the super bowl , billick said and what a tremendous experience , the most absolutely overwhelming thing it was to stand on that stage with mr modell and him get that afc championship trophy , what it means to him i'm proud gruden , again , was impressed absolutely , they are up there with the fearsome foursome and the steel curtain , gruden said of the ravens' defense after 18 games , to only yield 178 points and to sustain that level of play for 19 football games , i'm going to be very complimentary about what they did this year not to mention what they did in the black hole photos the ravens' shannon sharpe , who had one reception in the game , running for 96 yards and a touchdown the ravens owner art modell with ray lewis after the game he has owned the team , previously the cleveland browns , for 40 years \( photographs by the associated press \) \( pg d5 \) baltimore s tony siragusa , who finished with one assist , causing problems for oakland quarterback rich gannon , who was injured on the play in the second quarter \( agence francepresse \) \( pg d1 \)

garden city , ny , feb 13 lawyers for two young suspects in an underground campaign of arson and destruction in suffolk county are in negotiations with federal prosecutors that could result in guilty pleas in federal district court as soon as wednesday , a law enforcement official said today the two suspects , whom the authorities would not identify , are not the first to enter into plea negotiations with the federal authorities investigating more than two dozen recent acts of violence for which a radical environmental group , the earth liberation front , has claimed responsibility on friday , jared mcintyre , the 17yearold son of a new york city police sergeant , pleaded guilty to arson at a hearing in united states district court in central islip the hearing was closed to the public and its records were sealed in the proceedings , mr mcintyre agreed to be charged as an adult rather than as a juvenile under the deal , a federal judge can consider a more lenient sentence than mr mcintyre would otherwise have faced the other suspects are expected to do the same mr mcintyre is believed to be the first in the nation to cooperate with the federal authorities investigating attacks claimed by the earth liberation front , said craig s rosebraugh of portland , ore , who acts as spokesman for the group it opposes urban sprawl , deforestation and other acts it deems harmful to the environment but it remains unclear whether the suspects are members of some organized national effort or a band of local people sympathetic to the national group but unconnected to any central leadership thomas f liotti , the lawyer for one of the suspects , would not comment on the negotiations today this is very unfortunate , he said i think it is being treated much more seriously by the government than it should be i think these kids had the best of intentions in no way are they involved in any organized , national elf effort on jan 15 , agents of the federal bureau of investigation and the federal bureau of alcohol , tobacco and firearms searched mr mcintyre s house on bristol downs street , in coram they left with a computer , cans of red spray paint and other materials similar to those used in suffolk county attacks those attacks were carried out over the last several months against luxury homes and condominiums being built , construction vehicles , a cornfield used in genetic research and a mcdonald s corporate office on jan 19 , federal agents raided the home of a 16yearold suspect on helme avenue , in the hamlet of miller place mr mcintyre , a senior at longwood high school in middle island , was working at the brookhaven national laboratory in upton , just east of coram , researching the effects of increased carbon dioxide on plants as part of a project dealing with global warming , mona rowe , a spokeswoman for the lab , has said the mother of the 16yearold said today that her son was a smart boy she said the federal government was being very strict in dealing with him , but she would not elaborate we really were n't given much of a choice , she said when asked why her son was being charged as an adult there was no choice of being charged as a juvenile that was not an option richard j kaufman , a lawyer for mr mcintyre , declined to comment today when asked about two of the suspects , elaine d close of portland , a spokeswoman for the earth liberation front , said she knew the fbi had raided both of their houses last month but she could not say much else about the teenagers we do n't know if they are members of elf , but anyone could be , ms close said but they have not identified themselves as such and we have not had contact with them here in the press office none of us know any of them mr rosebraugh said the group does not disclose information about its members the group is deliberately decentralized , he said , to prevent the authorities from identifying its leaders he said the elf press office , in portland , acts merely as a conduit between the news media and members , who communicate with it anonymously and in ways mr rosebraugh would not identify mr rosebraugh said the group had been active around the united states since 1997 , and had claimed responsibility for attacks causing more than 37 million in damage mr rosebraugh said a plea would not dismantle the group , which he supports the group operates under an ideology , not a physical membership , he said so it is really impossible to dissolve that ideology
until friday , baseball s offseason had moved at a rather tepid pace sure , the yankees have been crawling toward a sevenyear contract with jason giambi and will most likely sign him for close to 120 million in the next few days still , before friday , the biggest freeagent signing had been john smoltz s threeyear , 30 million contract to return to the atlanta braves as their closer hohum but the pace increased dramatically friday as the yankees and the mets made a splashy and rare trade by swapping david justice and robin ventura the yankees signed steve karsay to a 2225 million deal , jason isringhausen went to the st louis cardinals for 27 million and the oakland athletics quickly replaced isringhausen by acquiring closer billy koch from the toronto blue jays for two prospects , all happening in a span of several hours there is much more to come baseball s winter meetings start in boston today and friday s splurge of activity should be surpassed with dozens of free agents , from barry bonds to bret boone to tino martinez , searching for new baseball addresses and some interesting players being mentioned in trade discussions , from gary sheffield to scott rolen to carlos delgado , it is unlikely that anyone will be complaining about a tepid pace by the time the meetings end when you get that many people face to face , you 've got a heck of a lot better chance of getting something done than when you 're talking on the phone , said dan o 'dowd , the general manager of the colorado rockies i think you could see some major trades i do know that there were a lot of conversations going on before the meetings those conversations will intensify today when representatives from all 30 teams , even the contractionthreatened minnesota twins and montreal expos , congregate at the marriott copley place hotel in boston early on in the offseason , a lot of people throw out wild ideas to create dialogue , almost like a fantasy league approach , said gerry hunsicker , the general manager of the houston astros once you get to the meetings , things start to go from fantasy to reality but , stay with the fantasy theme for a moment if you are a general manager in need of a power hitter , how about bonds \? he set a major league record with 73 homers last season , but one executive from an american league team said his market has been next to nothing scott boras , bonds s agent , is seeking a fiveyear , 100 million contract the san francisco giants have made an undisclosed offer and are the leading candidate and , right now , maybe the only candidate to sign the 37year old shift back to reality teams do not have infinite budgets another freeagent slugger is juan gonzalez , who hit 325 with 35 homers and batted in 140 runs in for the cleveland indians last year the indians declined his 14 million option , but they offered him arbitration on friday jeff moorad , gonzalez s agent , said that he wants a multiyear deal when one official from a major league team was asked how many teams had told him they were interested in signing gonzalez , he said , none indeed signing a bonds or a gonzalez is a fantasy for many teams if the mets had more payroll flexibility , bonds or gonzalez would probably interest them because they need an infusion of offense now that the mets have exchanged ventura for justice , general manager steve phillips has myriad decisions to make can he find a team to take justice s 7 million contract to get money to sink into improving the team \? phillips said he is interested in entertaining offers for justice , but he will have trouble finding a team to absorb the contract obviously , justice is just the beginning for the mets phillips would love to add a power hitter like jeromy burnitz , sheffield or raul mondesi , players who could be available in trades but , in order to sign a free agent like roger cede o , martinez or boone , phillips would have to first shed payroll and that means unloading someone like todd zeile phillips will be busy in boston since the yankees are close to adding giambi , have signed karsay to be a pricey setup man and have ventura as their third baseman , a chunk of their work is completed the yankees want to add another outfielder and are interested in moises alou , but not for the four years and 44 million that it could take to sign him they could also sign sterling hitchcock to a twoyear , 6 million deal and offer david wells an incentivebased contract the list of free agents also includes chan ho park , johnny damon , jason schmidt , hideo nomo , jeff shaw , kenny lofton , david bell and chuck knoblauch other players who have been mentioned in trade discussions include dmitri young , john rocker , carl everett , greg vaughn and glendon rusch no one knows if the 2002 season will be contested with 30 or 28 teams , but team officials said they must ignore the possibility of contraction hovering over them and work within the rules that exist o 'dowd said conversations about contraction left within 48 hours after commissioner bud selig made his announcement because it would be senseless to wait and hope to snare a player from a dispersal draft that might never happen it really has n't impacted my thinking , hunsicker said it s something i have no control over i 've got to move forward with regard to what we have control over if contraction happens , we 'll be prepared for it if it does n't , we 'll be prepared for that , too
oakland , calif , nov 25 two victories on the nets' first western conference trip would have been a blessing last season this season , it is a disappointment in trying to finish the fifth and final game of the trip with a victory against golden state to push them over 500 on the western swing , the nets had none of the fight they had in the previous four games instead , they played like this season s nets in the first half and finished with a whimper , like last season s nets the warriors , overcoming a 5point halftime deficit , outmuscled the nets under the basket in the third quarter , racing to a 10185 victory that sent the nets home with a 23 record on the trip the nets' backtoback losses dropped them to 95 over all they are still on top of the atlantic division , but it is a record that is very deceiving , coach byron scott said we are nowhere near where i think our guys think we are , scott said right now we do n't know how to handle success we came out in the second half and just gave in , just thinking that team was going to go away it s just not going to happen mentally and physically , they just beat us you can use all the excuses you want , but we just gave in to it it s the first time i 've seen that all season with this team the collapse deflated the nets , who had played hard on this trip until the third quarter tonight when the warriors launched a 207 run to start the half and outscored the nets , 3013 , in the period we got a little tired going into second half and the big men pretty much took over the game , said point guard jason kidd , who was playing in his hometown we 've been playing catchup since the denver game , and playing catchup on the road takes a lot out of you in the first half , when the nets dominated from the outside and the inside , kidd did not seem to miss he led all scorers with 15 points in the first half but when the warriors started pushing the nets under the basket , kidd was no longer a factor he scored just one point in the second half kenyon martin led the nets with 19 points antawn jamison led the warriors with 22 points kidd could not lead a dramatic rally tonight , as he had earlier on the trip with late 3pointers against denver and utah and the clinching free throws against the los angeles clippers we depend on the guy every night , so i think we get spoiled , nets center todd macculloch said when things are n't going well , the rest of us have to step up and we did n't do that tonight macculloch and the other post players blamed themselves for the loss they did what we knew they would do they crashed the boards , said macculloch , who finished with 5 rebounds warriors center erick dampier , meanwhile , had a gamehigh 14 rebounds , which helped golden state to a 5141 advantage on the boards each team had 23 rebounds at halftime , but the warriors also took the advantage there in the second half that falls on the big people , mostly myself , macculloch said we were n't able to keep them off the glass aaron williams agreed , saying that scott told the team at halftime how the warriors would play , but the nets did not listen they were playing harder than us and we let them play to their strengths , williams said scott would not accept any excuses after the game i thought we had a good team , but good teams play hard every night , he said good teams battle every night we just have n't learned to react to success well for the second straight game , the nets were playing without the reserve forward richard jefferson , who is out with a sprained left knee ligament scott said the team missed jefferson s energy and defense , something that was completely lacking in the third quarter the nets had led by 8 points early into the quarter before the warriors trampled the tiredlooking visitors dampier had six rebounds as the warriors outrebounded the nets , 168 , in the period meanwhile , the nets shot 27 percent , going through a scoring drought that lasted nearly five minutes and enabled the warriors to take a 12point lead into the fourth quarter the nets could not mount any rally as they had in their 9897 loss to the sacramento kings on saturday night they had no fight left the warriors took a 17point lead when the nets' reggie slater , who had not played any substantial minutes this season , turned the ball over with less than 10 minutes remaining and mookie blaylock converted a fastbreak layup the nets never pulled closer than 13 points scott took kidd out with 3 minutes 55 seconds to go , after he had played the entire second half there would be no lastsecond drama from him , no 3pointer at the buzzer it was n't our best game and this was a big game for us going back home , kidd said we 're not a team in the dark anymore , we 're out there in front we are going to have to get better at handling success photo keith van horn , avoiding a block by golden state s antawn jamison , had 13 points last night for the nets , who went 23 on their western trip \( associated press \)

the rangers still might make trades or sign more coveted free agents , but the pool of available stars is smaller it is not known whether their limited activity yesterday was by design , or because

remains interested in trading for jaromir jagr , the captain and right wing of the pittsburgh penguins jagr , the league s reigning scoring champion , is under contract for two more seasons at a total

garden city , ny , jan 24 two nassau county police officers were placed on desk duty today as an inquiry widened into a woman s report that she was sexually abused by a plainclothes officer in august one of those placed on administrative assignment was the eighth precinct officer under investigation for allegedly stopping the woman and forcing her to perform oral sex in exchange for her release , said a department spokesman , detective sgt kevin smith the other , sergeant smith said , was a supervisor working in the unit that investigates police misconduct the supervisor mishandled the woman s complaint by failing to begin an immediate internal investigation , sergeant smith said as a result , the case went uninvestigated by the police internal affairs unit for five months the supervisor took a report from eighth precinct personnel who called him the day the woman , an exotic dancer , came forward with her charges , but he did nothing but log it in a book where it stood a slim chance of being followed up quickly , sergeant smith said investigators are not yet certain that the episode involved an officer , not a police impersonator sergeant smith would not identify either of the officers the inaction on the case has stymied the police in their recent efforts to collect forensic evidence , interview people and piece together what happened that early morning in august , police officials said they should not treat any complaint against a police officer in a slipshod manner , said gary delaraba , the president of the nassau county police benevolent association the officer deserves an immediate hearing , an immediate investigation , and so do the people the eighth precinct officer is a former new york police department officer who joined the nassau force six years ago , the nassau police said the supervisor no longer works in the internal affairs unit , and is now on desk duty in the detective division , the police said it remained unclear today whether the former supervisor s decision not to investigate the woman s complaint was intentional or a mistake i ca n't say whether he did it intentionally or not that is part of the focus of the investigation , sergeant smith said he also said that a form should have been filled out at the eighth precinct and forwarded to the internal affairs unit and to the officer s patrol supervisors but none ever was , he said it was also unclear whether others in the internal affairs unit participated in the decision not to investigate the woman , whom the police did not identify , said the officer who stopped her on the suspicion of drunken driving had a badge and was driving in an unmarked police car he may have been part of a plainclothes crimedeterrent detail in the precinct only a handful of such unmarked cars would have been in use on the date in question , the police said officers who interviewed the woman showed her a photo of a former officer in another precinct who was arrested in october on charges that he raped a woman while on duty , the police said but they never showed her pictures of the officers driving unmarked cars on the august morning she said she was accosted deputy inspector peter a matuza said all precinct records from that day were being searched
it was too happy a day for such a sight early in the morning three weeks ago , my wife gave birth to our son hours later , i returned home to get my daughter we collected a pile of presents for the baby and a separate but equal pile for the brand new big sister then we drove back to the hospital where , outside the entrance , we saw them they were in hospital gowns , one with a broken leg , another in a wheelchair and still another with a bandaged iv stint embedded in his skin they were all patients at the hospital and had taken a break from their convalescence to walk and limp and wheel their way outside for a cigarette matteroffactly , they unwrapped cigarette boxes , fumbled with matches and blew smoke out through their noses leaning against the hospital , they looked like macabre sentries smokers are , of course , no longer freerange citizens they are only allowed their habit in doorways , under awnings and in other crevices of the landscape , but i 'll always remember them inside that s because i grew up with a mother who smoked two packs a day , which meant a cigarette was lighted every 28 minutes of my waking childhood smoking was as much a part of my youth as story time , only more frequent my mother is now in her 40th year of that twopackaday habit when people ask her if she s ever going to quit , she answers with her typical brand of direct humor i am no quitter she mounts a defense of smoking , though again in her own humorous way she s fond of telling a story about being on an air jordan flight to the middle east , when a number of passengers began bristling about the stringent nosmokingonwednesday rule my mother immediately produced a large stash of nicotinejuiced fake , plastic cigarettes from her handbag and passed them out to the people in her row within minutes , there you had it a jewish grandmother and five arabs , all smiling and laughing together while sharing stories about their collective plight as smokers cigarettes , my mother said , brought peace but they also bring health problems last month , my mother told me , between winces , of a pain in my back , but up where my lungs are though she is normally never one for serious actions , she went for testing immediately and then , in short order , finetuned her will and cleaned her attic when you are a heavy smoker or a family member you wait for that spot on an xray like others do a bus , so i had a bad feeling but the results came back and i learned that only a heavy smoker could greet news of serious disk problems with sighs of relief when my mother came to the hospital to visit our new baby , i asked her if she had seen the smokers seen them \? she asked i stopped for a smoke with them she then told me that she , too , had smoked as a patient after a bursitis attack in the middle of the night , she rushed herself to westchester medical center grasping her painful left arm while lying on an emergency room gurney , she slowly got up and asked a doctor if , while waiting for her drugs to take effect , she could go outside to smoke on the day my son was born , inherited characteristics were the topic of the day whose eyes did he have \? and from that angle , did he look like his sister \? my wife \? me \? a cross \? but it s not just facial features and fingers that one wonders about i do n't smoke one of the advantages of growing up with a smoking mom is that , when it comes time to rebel , oat bran and vitamins can do the trick but there are a grabbag of studies , all contradictory , about the inherited nature of addictions my decision not to smoke could very well be less choice than chance the genetic booby prize for desperate behavior may have just skipped me as a parent , i have tried not to think about this , never sure to what extent our fears become selffulfilling but could a boy , hours old , become a man with unrelenting habits , an iv stuck in his arm as he stands outside some hospital , trying repeatedly to work his matchbook against the wind \? even before your children are born you have ambitions for them but when you see them for the first time , you realize that you 'd trade all those ambitions for the simple certainty that along with the dna for long toes and dimples , there lurks none for addiction drawing \( nancy doniger \)

washington , april 16 president bush took the opportunity of tax day today to give a preview of what might be in store for senators who oppose his proposed 16 trillion tax cut and those who go along with it mr bush held up to ridicule those senators who oppose him , calling them big spenders , then offered warm words for a democrat who , he said , was on his side but later , a spokeswoman for the democrat , senator max cleland of georgia , said mr cleland was not supporting mr bush s proposal and was puzzled about how the president had the impression that he was mr bush was speaking to an audience of about 250 people at the united states chamber of commerce in a 15minute speech for his proposed tax cut , mr bush , standing in front of two giant reproductions of 1040 federal income tax forms , said the federal government was taking more out of people s paychecks today than it had since 1944 our country is at peace , but our government is charging wartime prices , he said enough is enough , he asserted in a phrase that became a refrain mr bush said that some in congress had complained that because his proposed tax cut was so big , the budget did not have enough money for some social programs but in 2001 , he said , the income tax will yield 2 billion in revenues for each and every one of the 535 members of congress i think they should be able to get by on that even the senators he has said his plan will return 1 , 600 to the typical family of four in one year when fully phased in , at some point later this decade with that money , mr bush said , a family could pay a typical monthly mortgage , buy nearly three months' worth of groceries or pay for gas for two cars for a year , although at this point the chances seem small that congress will pass his plan in its current form he then suggested that he had made his case to mr cleland even though mr cleland had voted against the plan a couple of weeks ago when the senate approved a 12 trillion tax cut i saw a good democrat senator out of georgia the other day , mr bush said max cleland said that he is interested in , when he comes back , interested in supporting the 16 trillion plan i think that s what he said it certainly sounded like it to me and that s a good sign i appreciate the senator going home and listening to the people as it happens , mr cleland was in georgia today announcing that he was running for reelection next year because georgia voted overwhelmingly for mr bush in last year s presidential election , and because georgia s other senator , zell miller , also a democrat , supports mr bush s proposal , mr bush has perceived mr cleland as a possible convert , too he even gave the senator a ride on air force one recently on a trip to georgia but a spokeswoman for mr cleland said today that the senator remained firmly with the centrist democrats who opposed the president s higher figure there must be a misunderstanding , said patricia murphy , mr cleland s spokeswoman max said he s never spoken to president bush about the tax cut ms murphy said the senator had written a newspaper opinion article explaining why he voted for the 12 trillion proposal and said he might be open to the 16 trillion plan but only if it were spread out over a longer period of time it was not clear whether mr bush had actually understood mr cleland to be supporting his plan or whether this was a nonetoosubtle pressure tactic ms murphy said the fact that mr bush cited mr cleland today as he announced his reelection seemed an amazing coincidence photo president bush sought support for his 16 trillion tax cut yesterday in a washington address to the united states chamber of commerce \( agence francepresse \)
pepsico announced its fifth consecutive quarter of doubledigit earnings growth yesterday and predicted a sixth , despite a persistent weakness in soda sales driving the gains was the fritolay unit , which accounts for more than 60 percent of pepsico s sales and has benefited from a consumer shift away from sitdown meals in favor of snacks eaten on the run helped by its wide distribution system , which stretches from convenience stores to walmart , fritolay posted growth nearly double that of its competitors and helped push pepsico s fourthquarter revenue up 76 percent , to 61 billion in the quarter , operating profit rose 124 percent , to 984 million , net income increased 147 percent , to 567 million , and the company met analysts' earnings forecasts of 38 cents a share , a 15 percent increase from a year earlier the results offered pepsi s new management team a chance to allay any concerns that it may not be able to sustain the company s momentum although the team , led by steven s reinemund , president and chief operating officer , will not officially take over until the company s 134 billion acquisition of quaker oats is completed , which may happen in the second quarter , it has been taking the reins since early last fall our outlook is simple , said mr reinemund , in a conference call with analysts and reporters more of the same in 2001 , the company said , it will profit from cutting costs by putting fewer chips in bags of lays , doritos , fritos and its other wellknown brands pepsico officials said the move , begun last fall , permits the company to sidestep visible price increases that may drive customers away , while covering the rising cost of packaging but some stock analysts questioned whether the practice could be sustained and wondered how long the company could increase snack sales without raising prices buying quaker will at least add granola bars and rice cakes to pepsico s arsenal within 10 years , the number of americans who are 45 and older is expected to grow by 23 percent , according to sanford bernstein company the aging of the population may not be good for cheetos , but it could bode well for pepsi s healthier snacks another trend that presents both a challenge and an opportunity for pepsi is the shift away from sodas with gatorade , the sports drink that prompted the company to buy quaker oats , pepsi will have another product to lessen the growing thirst for noncarbonated beverages but the company s soda sales are flat , and none more so than pepsi , its flagship brand , whose sales declined 05 percent last year , according to morgan stanley dean witter and while aquafina , the company s bottled water brand , leads all others in the field with 14 percent of the market , sales of pepsi s drinks in north america grew no more than 1 percent last year , and in some quarters did not grow at all it s a concern , said andrew conway , an analyst with morgan stanley they 've got to generate some volume growth out of the big brands like pepsi , diet pepsi and pepsi one unlike coke , pepsi is advertising heavily , with seemingly little effect to counter sagging enthusiasm for its sodas , the company says , it will flood the market with new products like pepsi twist and a variation on its mountain dew drink called code red price increases , which have been hurting consumption for more than a year , will also moderate , a change that the company expects will bring consumers back down the soda aisle after looking for bargains elsewhere shares of pepsico dropped 2 cents yesterday , to 4497 photo fritolay products , which account for more than 60 percent of pepsico s sales , have gained from a shift away from sitdown meals \( bloomberg news \)

following are excerpts from remarks yesterday by senators orrin g hatch , republican of utah , and charles e schumer , democrat of new york , before the senate judiciary committee voted on the nomination of john ashcroft for attorney general , as recorded by the federal news service inc senator hatch senator ashcroft is no stranger to this committee he served on this committee with distinction for over the past four years , working closely with members on both sides of the aisle as a member of the committee , he proved himself a leader in many areas , including the fight against drugs and violence , the assessment of the proper role of the justice department , and the protection of victims' rights but , having heard the relentless drumbeat of accusation after accusation in recent weeks , i can fairly say , in my view , that there has been an unyielding effort to redefine this man of unlimited integrity some have termed the statements made by john ashcroft at the hearing a confirmation conversion , a metamorphosis on the contrary , the true metamorphosis of john ashcroft is in the misleading picture painted of him by narrow leftwing interest groups as my colleagues are well aware , john ashcroft has an impressive , almost 30year record of loyal public service as state attorney general , a twoterm governor and then , of course , as senator for the state of missouri i should also mention that as missouri s attorney general , he was so well respected , he was elected by his peers across the nation to head the national association of attorneys general and again as governor , he was elected by the nation s governors to serve as the head of the national governors' association i have said this before and i will say it again of the 67 attorneys general we have had , only a handful even come close to having some of the qualifications that john ashcroft brings in assuming the position of chief law enforcement officer of this great nation now , i was deeply saddened to read a new york times report the day following the release of the bob jones university transcript that , the leader of a major liberal group opposing mr ashcroft s nomination expressed disappointment that the comments were not much different from those many politicians offer in religious settings they quoted this leader as saying , this clearly will not do it this person said of hopes that the he was certainly hoping that the speech they quoted this leader as saying , 'this clearly will not do it , ' this person said of hopes that the speech might help defeat the nomination but , of course , found out that it was a reasonable speech also , let me note that some opponents have charged that senator ashcroft s answers at the hearing and his written answers to the approximately 400 questions now , this is without precedent as far as i know by committee members were evasive wrong throughout , senator ashcroft has consistently and persuasively responded that he will enforce the law , irrespective of his personal views and again , i have seen a failure to give him the benefit of the doubt with regard to his answers to these questions his long and distinguished record in missouri supports his commitment to follow and observe the rule of law , but this record is ignored let s face it , for some of those looking to oppose him , he simply cannot do anything right when he answers questions in detail to attempt to explain his record , he s termed evasive because he simply should have answered , yes , if he really meant it when he answers a question with a simple and straightforward yes , he s accused of not confronting the issue completely senator schumer at the start of the hearings two weeks ago , mr chairman , i asked whether john ashcroft s passionate advocacy of his deeply held convictions over the last 25 years would limit his capacity to have the balanced world view necessary for an attorney general i asked him directly how he could turn off his zealous and impassioned advocacy that had driven him for so long senator ashcroft s answer in his two days of testimony was unequivocal in essence , he said the job of attorney general would require him to enforce , follow and uphold the law whether he agreed with it or not as a senator , it had been appropriate for him to try to change the law , to be an advocate for causes , but as attorney general , he would set those roles aside mr chairman , as much as i would like to believe that , i remain unconvinced that attorney general ashcroft can stop being senator ashcroft if this committee were faced with a nominee who had for the previous 25 years argued that drug dealing should be legal , but assured us that he would now prosecute drug dealers regardless of his personal prior advocacy , we would proceed to vote 18 to nothing against him as senator leahy eloquently stated on the floor yesterday , and senator feinstein persuasively argued last week , and senators kennedy , biden and kohl argued earlier today , john ashcroft s views and histories of zealous advocacy on issues like civil rights , gun control and choice put him so far outside the mainstream that i am unconvinced , even after the hearings , that he will be the impartial , balanced decision maker we need and deserve as our attorney general
ten years dave checketts lasted a decade in the corporate jungle known as madison square garden , and maybe that s the achievement he can brag about most as he exits a building prematurely emptied of basketball and hockey postseason fans this is not meant as sarcasm having been around the garden twice as long as checketts was , i can tell you that its professional ladder always seemed to be swaying because people did n't know their place if i had a dollar for every time a garden executive offered an unflattering tidbit about another , i 'd be in the same tax bracket as checketts he more than survived as the building passed from paramount to viacom to cablevision , and pardon me if i 've lost track of one owner or another checketts thrived , climbing the final rung on the ladder to become the garden s main man when bob gutkowski was fired but it was on gutkowski s watch that the most memorable contemporary event at the garden occurred , the rangers winning the stanley cup in 1994 checketts s knicks fell a victory short of a championship the same year under his stewardship , the knicks hired pat riley and began a dynamic 10year run that appeared to end officially 11 days ago the garden was full every night , but the knicks , despite enormous payrolls , never did win and during checketts s garden presidency , the rangers blundered into disrepair his defenders always said that you had to understand what an astute businessman he was he was expanding the garden s revenue streams in ways that had nothing to do with balls and pucks that was his true genius , and value but the reality is that the garden , more than a concert hall or a dog show hall , is arguably the country s premier sports palace and its owners , the dolan family , have partnerships with the likes of rupert murdoch and nbc the business of sports these days is about the synergy of teams and television dave checketts s teams were n't feeding that beast , and after remodeling the front offices of both teams in the past two years , he had run out of fall guys ten years it occurred to me recently that checketts had reached that milestone , but only when i read that seth abraham had joined the garden hierarchy as chief operating officer after his long tenure at hbo then there was abraham quoted in many of the newspaper accounts of the felix trinidad fight last saturday night restoring the garden to prominence in the fight game was one of checketts s pet projects he always seemed to be front and center for a big fight when i saw abraham s name in the paper , the thought that checketts might not be long for his job actually ran through my mind he was 35 years old when he replaced al bianchi as the knicks' president in 1991 bianchi was a pro basketball lifer , a man with no degree of fluency in the language corporate executives speak he knew that stanley jaffe , the film mogul paramount was about to install as the garden president , had called for his head and that of the rangers' president , jack diller , from behind the scenes jaffe got me , bianchi said not long after getting the ax he put this kid in , checketts you think he knows anything about basketball \? bianchi did n't know and , truth was , the people who hired checketts did n't know either it was reported that checketts had had something to do with the drafting of john stockton and karl malone in utah it did n't matter if he had checketts hit the garden , boyishly blond with convincing blue eyes and the blessings of david stern he was smooth and successful working the news media , until he fired knicks general manager ernie grunfeld , his first garden hire , before the team made an unlikely run to the finals in 1999 once that happened , it was as if a spotlight had been turned on checketts and his eyes did n't look blue after all there was a little blood red , mixed with dollar green for years , he sounded convincing when he said that he understood the average fan was being closed out of hockey and hoops by the wildly escalating ticket prices he said he wanted to do something about it but he never did , and then he shrugged and said it was n't his problem as long as rich people were willing to pay i find myself wanting , in the end , to say more nice things about checketts , but by the standards i'm conditioned to judge him by , i ca n't under him , the garden became impossibly expensive and much too loud none of his teams won it all he got 10 years , and that was more time than most photo dave checketts s tenure lasted 10 years \( vic delucia the new york times \)
did n't the nba draft sap arizona s roster \? are n't the starters from last season s national runnerup scattered among pro teams \? who are these guys \? stunned maryland basketball fans could have asked themselves these questions as they left madison square garden last night muttering about another disappointment the terrapins have a history of crushing finishes , and last night they added an opening worthy of their past led by jason gardner , its sole returning starter , unranked arizona defeated maryland , ranked no 2 in the associated press news media poll , by 7167 last night in the ikon classic benefiting coaches vs cancer , which kicked off the new season we had to be everyone s afterthought , coach lute olson of arizona said of the fourteam field no 6 florida beat temple by 7264 in the first game and will meet arizona in the title game tonight temple and maryland will play the consolation game at 6 30 pm arizona lost last season s national championship game to duke its five starters entered the nba draft , and then gardner withdrew the terrapins returned four starters from a final four team that could not beat duke , losing three of four meetings maryland s first appearance in the national semifinals seemed to wipe away its reputation for failing to win the big game coach gary williams has tried reminding his players of the difference a year makes and last night he repeatedly blamed his team for not being tough enough and settling for jump shots against arizona it s disappointing , but it also makes everybody understand this is another year , williams said the terrapins have had a tough time their bus broke down on the new jersey turnpike on tuesday night with the doors stuck open on a chilly night , the players watched the film exit wounds as they waited for another bus maryland never warmed up last night gardner may be magical with the ball he finished with 23 points , 4 assists and 4 steals but maryland s front line was intimidating , as gardner learned tied at 6161 , the 5foot10 gardner received a pass from the junior luke walton on the left side he went up for a 3pointer as maryland center lonny baxter , 6 feet 8 and 260 pounds , crashed down on him i thought he blocked it , gardner said when i was on the ground , i heard the crowd and thought it must 've gone in it did , and so did gardner s free throw for a 4point play with 3 minutes 17 seconds left maryland drew to 6967 in the closing seconds and byron mouton fouled wildcats forward rick anderson with three seconds left anderson made the first before williams frantically tried calling a timeout maryland had none left and an assistant coach pulled him away before the officials noticed his attempts anderson made the second shot juan dixon scored 21 points for maryland , but gardner powered arizona and walton added 12 points and 12 rebounds six of the nine players olson used were freshmen i 've never gone into a game with less of a feeling of what s going to happen , he said florida had no such problems , overcoming early problems with no 16 temple s matchup zone it used its fullcourt press to pull away from temple in the first game florida guard justin hamilton , back after missing the end of last season following reconstructive knee surgery , scored 15 of his 17 points in the first half and udonis haslem added 16 rebounds and 14 points david lee , a freshman who was a mcdonald s allamerican last season , added 15 points off the bench as florida lived up to its ranking florida s press produced 15 temple turnovers , a stunning total for a team that averaged 83 last season temple used five newcomers and coach john chaney was not kind afterward he criticized guard lynn greer , a senior who shot 4 for 19 , for not trusting his teammates and for running into multiple defenders chaney said temple would have handled the press better had guard david hawkins played but hawkins , a doublefigure scorer last season , is academically ineligible for at least the first semester chaney awarded jay jameson a scholarship after he served as a walkon last season another player , hawley smith , received a scholarship after chaney noticed him while recruiting his high school teammate glen elliott they are a much better team than what they were last year , chaney said of florida how do you measure that against a much worse team in temple this year \? photo brett nelson , who scored 10 points , driving on lynn greer of temple during florida s victory last night at madison square garden \( michelle v agins the new york times \)
just as he always planned , antonio santos was going home twentyfour years after he moved to farmingville , mr santos , 58 , a carpenter and contractor , sold his house and packed his belongings for the trip back to portugal i am going to retire there , mr santos said my roots are there my culture is there my everything is there mr santos s sisters , nieces , aunts and cousins still live in his hometown , s o martinho do porto he keeps an apartment there where his wife , maria celeste , and two daughters spent every summer and he has plans to build a house all my life , my wife is begging , 'i want to go to portugal , ' mr santos said at least 75 percent want to go back but for mr santos , who did n't finish high school but made a decent living framing houses , leaving the island is n't easy he came to farmingville in 1976 in search of a better life in the growing portugueseamerican community , he found it he joined the building committee for the portugueseamerican center of suffolk , a social club in farmingville that is now the core of the community and he felt at home with 14 , 000 portugueseamericans , farmingville has four portuguese restaurants , one portuguese bakery , two portuguese supermarkets and an atm machine with a portuguese language option in 1994 , when he was the president of the social center s general assembly , mr santos arranged for a brazilian priest from the larger portuguese community in mineola to come to the church of the resurrection in farmingville every sunday and celebrate the 10 30 am mass in portuguese it s a very good community , said mr santos , waffling with dual allegiance and whether he 'll stay in portugal for good very friendly i am going to miss a lot of things over here friends the life over here is a lot better for me it s a little portugal over here , but not the real portugal when the portuguese first came to farmingville 40 years ago , it was a rough area , said john moedas , president of the center and a former president of the farmingville chamber of commerce they were forced to have their own munitions because they were afraid , mr moedas said the portuguese cleaned up the neighborhood they bought the dilapidated houses they started to fix them they are the ones who built farmingville they never felt unwanted they prided themselves on their reputation as hard workers with strong family ties they started construction companies , eventually dominating the local industry but in 1987 , when the ethnic community which had spread to selden , port jefferson , centerreach and holtsville wanted to erect a spacious , milliondollar building on portion road as the largest portugueseamerican social club on the east coast , there was resistance from the town of brookhaven there were people who thought it was going to be a bar , mr moedas said they did n't realize what was going to be there later they sent letters to apologize in the past year , farmingville s image has been tainted by racist incidents involving the daylaborer community of mexicans and salvadorans unwittingly , the portuguese were tossed into the swirl of controversy one local newspaper mixed the portuguese and day laborers and called us illegal aliens that were soiling the streets of farmingville , ' said jennifer simoes , 21 , a college senior from port jefferson station who drove five hours from the state university of new york at cortland for a party at the cultural center and a portuguese concert the next day we were misinterpreted , misrepresented in that article , she said when i was younger , often teachers put us together as part of the hispanic community at this point the people are able to differentiate a lot more we are not a part of the hispanic community we are separate celso ferreira , 28 , of setauket , a soccer coach at the club , said that people still got mixed up because of the language for someone who does n't speak spanish or portuguese , they sound similar , mr ferreira said it s very easily mixed up we get blamed for being immigrants it s not just farmingville you see this in huntington , in patchogue in farmingville there are a lot of portuguese we were thrown into that mix , he continued we received a bad rap for something we did n't do a lot of us work in construction they assumed we were involved in what was going on they figured we brought them here mr ferreira added that the portuguese are american citizens with legal jobs many employ the day laborers , who wait on the street for work and they play alongside hispanics in the soccer leagues they have to make a living , mr ferreira said , harboring no ill will toward the more recent immigrants that s why we 're all here he predicted that as secondgeneration portugueseamericans graduate from college and enter the professions , the more recent hispanic arrivals will take over the construction industry , just as the portuguese took over from the italians a generation ago
when i was a little girl using public toilets in big cities like new york or chicago , my mother always warned me to be careful you never know whose behind was on that thing , she would say she was n't just talking about diseases she meant that you never knew who had been in the stall before you and what they did in there my mother envisioned nasty habits and untoward behavior smoking , drinking , sex , drug use that made public toilets a last resort something of my mother s attitude is loose in this city , which has very few public toilets earlier this month , two pay toilets finally arrived in midtown , paid for by the 34th street partnership , a business improvement district but they have been mostly used by tourists , said a spokesman for adshel , their manufacturer the fractious potty history includes a 1990 class action against the city by homeless people seeking public toilets complaints about the lack of clean , safe toilets in subway stations and parks and entreaties by cab drivers for stalls last spring , the city council allocated 5 million to build 100 pay toilets none have yet appeared there is no toilet lobby , said doug lasdon , executive director of the urban justice center , a nonprofit advocacy group for poor people that has pushed for public lavatories for years it is a serious issue he said his group s research found that people do want public toilets it is not a matter of money , mr lasdon continued there are public toilets in 600 cities around the world , he said they 've been in san francisco for five years new york ca n't seem to get it done public toilets and new yorkers apparently do n't mix but why \? i think mama hit the nail on the head with the strange behinds theory it s attitude if new yorkers really wanted public toilets , they would have them many people just have limits when it comes to sharing a toilet with strangers to go inside a little space on the street and pull down your pants creates a level of vulnerability that many new yorkers would rather skip so instead , people duck into restaurants , stores or other places that are ostensibly better monitored recently , the issue erupted in holliswood , queens there , a group of residents so vehemently opposed the construction of a twotoilet comfort station in a small playground near their homes that councilman sheldon s leffler , a democrat , withdrew 650 , 000 in city financing for the project after it had been approved by community board 8 antitoilet people said they feared the station would fall into disrepair they said they worried that it would not just be used by small children and pregnant women , but would also attract child molesters , vagrants , criminals and people who do n't clean up after themselves this was not the first toilet battle for community board 8 last may , the board voted against a 350 , 000 comfort station for utopia playground in fresh meadows residents had the same fears as in holliswood mr leffler said the opposition to the holliswood comfort station was beyond vehement and as searing as anything he had seen in 20 years in government he has proposed a new comfort station in nearby cunningham park , which is larger and is used more he recognizes the difficulties of the issue a lot of people have to go to the bathroom , but you never have to go to the bathroom on the subway , he said my body has programmed itself because there are no functioning toilets in queens , claire fallon , a spokeswoman for the holliswood civic association , said of the city s public toilets , i would no more go into a dark hole than i would stand on a spike of the empire state building the association led the opposition to the holliswood comfort station mrs fallon added that in decades of living in new york , she has never set foot in a public toilet in a park or a subway she said many people , especially women , feel the same way nothing is patrolled properly once it s put in , she said nothing is kept up marc haken , chairman of the community board s youth services planning committee , said that the proposal for a comfort station in the holliswood park was not dead , and that the community had appealed to claire shulman , the borough president , for money he added that it was ridiculous that children who use the playground have to go into the bushes for bodily functions he also said the issues of public toilets were not just crime or aesthetics owners of singlefamily dwellings , which surround the playground , wanted to keep neighbors from a nearby apartment complex away from their neck of the woods , he asserted and he said mr leffler caved in to political pressure from those homeowners mrs fallon said that accusation was nonsense everyone in holliswood gets along , she said just as long as they all use the bathrooms in their own homes drawing \( mark matcho \)
prayer sessions gave way to paperwork memorial services were replaced by the monday morning meeting sputtering at times but managing not to stall , america s corporate machinery began to whir again yesterday whir and wheeze the ford motor company closed five of its plants for at least a week because it could not transport enough parts across the canadian border general electric and other makers of airplane engines are bracing for a drop in orders , prompting one manufacturer , united technologies , to announce that the disaster could cut its operating income by 250 million in the fourth quarter coming into this crisis we were doing reasonably well , said john w douglass , president of the aerospace industries association of america now , of course , we do n't know rental car companies , whose fortunes are also heavily wedded to airport traffic , tell a similar story at hertz , business has been cut in half , and avis has been limping along on oneway rentals by stranded travelers racing to get home our traditional business practically disappeared , said ted deutsch , an avis spokesman and , of course , work itself was not its normal grind , a week after the leveling of the world trade center for workers at every rung of the corporate ladder , still trying to shake their sense of shock , daily tasks often seemed trivial in the face of the tragedy at hand people want to go back to work it s the only therapy but they ca n't , said donny deutsch , chief executive of the deutsch inc advertising agency in new york i'm staring out my window at the smoke at some companies , a mask of normalcy was simply impossible to wear a minor fire in boston s prudential tower yesterday morning , started when a trampled extension cord set some nearby plastic ablaze that sent gillette employees scrambling down 49 flights of stairs , through smoke that immediately brought last week s terror attacks to mind it was totally unsettling , said eric kraus , a gillette spokesman others continued to grapple with the loss of their colleagues praecis pharmaceuticals , a drug manufacturer in waltham , mass , opened a conference call yesterday with a tribute to a colleague who died in the plane that dove into the pentagon even those companies that seemed relatively unscathed had to scrap many of their plans , wary of appearing preoccupied with profits in a time of crisis neiman marcus put off mailing out the 75th edition of its annual christmas book catalog until consumers seemed more inclined to celebrate in some cases , corporations canceled promotional events that would have seemed tasteless given the circumstances last tuesday , for example , mattel had planned to promote its matchbox vehicles , including fire engines and police cruisers , by teaching children how to dial 911 and to act out imaginary emergencies with play phones all of those things got canceled , said sara rosales , a spokeswoman for the company , adding that the company had postponed all of its promotional events for hitachi data systems , the end of the fiscal quarter is only two weeks away , a time when david e roberson , the company s chief operating officer , usually leans on his sales staff to close as many deals as possible but yesterday , his tone was noticeably different , he said normally , i 'd be very aggressive with these guys about improving their numbers , especially in the united states , mr roberson said this time , however , we did not have the conversation , he added , even though it would probably hurt his business temporarily with planes back in the air , ibm said that its employees would stop driving emergency deliveries to customers in need and workers at general mills will no longer get in their cars , payroll checks in hand , to stage a relay race throughout the midwest , trying to make sure their coworkers have cash for the weekend but looking further ahead , many companies said they were weighing the importance of air travel against the welfare of their employees for its board meeting later this week , pepsico said it was opting for conference calls instead of facetoface meetings in the future , pepsico said , its employees will be less likely to fly from city to city , simply to attend meetings that could just as well take place on the phone immediately after the terror attacks , maersk , one of the largest shipping companies in the united states and the major shipper in the port of new yorknew jersey , said that none of its employees would be allowed to fly until the crisis settled down now it is letting its executives board planes , but only for critically essential business reasons with prior approvals from the corporate offices , according to eric sisco , vice president and general counsel other companies are contemplating even bigger changes the thermo electron corporation , a manufacturer of measuring equipment , says it is now questioning the logic of having 335 locations around the world executives are working out ways of scaling back on that number by consolidating offices , trying to take travel out of the equation altogether the focus on corporate security also appears to be increasing the popularity of background checks on job candidates preemploycom usually conducts about 2 , 000 criminal checks a day on applicants for companies of all sizes , but the small startup company has watched its business surge by 67 percent since last tuesday part of the increase has come from applicants themselves , especially those born and educated outside the united states few may have thought it necessary before , but now they are asking the company to verify their r sum s before going to interviews , hoping to preempt any doubts about their trustworthiness i wish my business had grown because i was the best salesperson in the world , said robert mather , the company s president i think it s sad that we get an increase because of this perhaps even more central , some businesses said the attacks would make them reassess what they sell daniel grossman , the chief executive of wild planet toys in san francisco , was stranded in new york last week after the attacks when he finally got home , his 5yearold son , who likes to suggest new toys for the company , was eager to show off his latest idea it was a toy that had a plane crashing into a building and all the pieces scatter , mr grossman said his company already has a spy line , with gadgets like a listening device and a spy camera but now he is not so sure what to make of them i'm thinking about things very differently since my son produced this toy still , there were some signs that consumers were moving past the tragedy , at least in their appetite for information two weeks ago , web surfers frequently typed in words like shark attack and anne heche on googlecom , an internet search engine then , the twin towers collapsed , and the most popular topics suddenly became nostradamus , world trade center and osama bin laden now , googlecom executives say the mainstays of many internet search engines have started to reappear in the thin white windows that take surfers where they want to go to sex and mp3 sites

whoever designed the st charlie s logo , an angel offering succor in the form of a beer , could not have known how appropriate it would seem in the days after sept 11 just as people gave blood , so , in a way , did st charlie s , its deserted larder yielding up keg after keg and case after case ground zero bar open 24 hours no cover , was scrawled in the thick dust on one of the remaining windows

firefighters , police officers and ironworkers could have drunk and 5 , 000 in cash was missing in the months that followed , long after rescue workers had left , just about everything else but the tables vanished , the owners say the bar stools , four televisions , antique light fixtures and mirrors , oil paintings , stemware , pots and pans , linens and telephones in short , what survived the collapse of skyscrapers did not survive the aftermath we 're literally starting from zero again , said duane anzalone , who along with his wife , joanna , and her brother jozef kielczynski scrimped and borrowed to buy st charlie s two years ago to them , it was a kind of home mr anzalone started working there as a food runner 20 years ago ms anzalone had waited tables on and off for almost as long mr kielczynski cooked the owners are unsure who is responsible for taking what , or even if some things were taken for legitimate reasons like decontamination what they do know is the chronology of events for almost a week after sept 11 , the family did not even know what had happened to their restaurant , which is in the fencedin frozen zone the first news they had was when they read about the ground zero bar in the new york times ms anzalone cried to know that guys were in here having a drink a welldeserved drink , she said it just told me that st charlie s was still here , doing what it s supposed to do a week later , the anzalones persuaded a police officer to escort them to the restaurant the bar looked like the site of a threeweek fraternity party one dining room had been used for triage another had been commandeered by a searchandrescue team from indiana in the dust on the bar , there were notes that made ms anzalone tear up again thank you to the bar owner you saved us with comfort but then they saw the basement the toilets were overflowing liquor and cash were missing , they said the anzalones were stung for insurance purposes , they filed a police report , but declined to press charges i ca n't even think about accusing all the heroes of our city of doing anything wrong , mr anzalone said and i do n't really feel that they did anything wrong rescue workers may not , in fact , have been guilty of more than having a drink the people who began bartending at the ground zero bar in the chaotic days after sept 11 wore st charlie s polo shirts , but mr anzalone said none of his employees were there , and there were extra shirts in his office when the bartenders disappeared , the workers took over , bringing up cases of wine from the basement , the lamps on their hard hats winking in the darkness i was sort of torn , because i think if the owners had been there , they would have been the first to throw open the doors , said fred mascia , a commodities firm executive and a st charlie s regular for 15 years the people who were in there were wrong , but they were heroic heroic times call for different measures or different standards in a lot of ways before sept 11 , st charlie s had a bustling and loyal lunch business of wall street and world trade center workers , and there were plans to open on weekends to cater to the growing number of downtown residents the december calendar was filled with christmas parties they had put in so much time , and so much energy , mr mascia said they were just going to start to enjoy the fruits of their labor and , said mr anzalone , they might have been able to recover from the ravages of the ground zero bar but there was worse to come their landlord , deutsche bank , was not able to lock and guard the building until oct 3 in early november , deutsche bank hired an environmental cleanup crew and told st charlie s to expect the bill everything salvageable would be cleaned rather than thrown out , but the building would be sealed during the cleanup and the restaurant s owners would not be allowed to supervise , mr anzalone said he was told during a walkthrough the day before the cleaning began at that point , he said , much of what is now missing was there that day , he took everything he could carry with him
the deindustrialization of america in the late 20th century has given birth to a new field , industrial archaeology the national park service , for example , is trying to identify , evaluate and preserve some of the country s important industrial artifacts major factories and mills that are no longer in use these engineering marvels are documented in a new book , industry , architecture and engineering american ingenuity 17501950 by louis bergeron and maria teresa maiullaripontois \( abrams \) the book s vintage photographs record the heyday of the country s steel mills , shipyards and manufacturing plants , although the hardworking men who populated them are largely missing but there are many ways to tell the story of those whose brawn built the american century , one of them being to chronicle the toys they gave their children since 1920 youngsters have cherished the products of the buddy l toy company , founded in east moline , ill , by fred lundahl , who manufactured fenders for international harvester trucks he started by making a toy dump truck out of steel scraps for his son buddy soon after , he started selling buddy l toys for boys , made of pressed steel many were large enough for a child to straddle , propelling himself with his feet others were pull toys a pioneer in the steeltoy field , lundahl persuaded marshall field s and f a o schwarz to carry his line he did very well until the depression , then sold the company while buddy l made sports cars and model t flivvers , most of its toys are miniatures of the vehicles that american men operated at work locomotives , airplanes , buses , tractors , fire trucks and delivery vans from march 9 through 11 , randy inman auctions will put 1 , 300 lots of buddy l toys on the block at the days inn and conference center in allentown , pa other items in the sale include a few dozen motorcycle toys owned by the comedian jonathan winters the preview begins next friday at 10 am the entire catalog is on a web site www inmanauctions com mr inman s business is in waterville , me , but he is conducting the sale in allentown , he said , because it s the antique toy capital of the country word of the sale has been spreading mr inman said that nearly a thousand toy collectors planned to attend most of his auctions draw about 300 and that he was accepting absentee bids the estimates for the toys run from 50 to 20 , 000 apiece it s hard to predict prices because many of the toys are brand , spanking new and still have their original boxes , he said none of the toys were ever restored or touched up they are right out of the factory while buddy l was not the only company that made pressedsteel toys , its competitors' versions were smaller buddy l made the finest ones , mr inman said he expects the auction to earn from 1 million to 2 million , he said the toys from the company s archives will be auctioned without reserve prices the sale includes individual components of buddy l railroads , including locomotives , tenders , box cars , tankers , coal cars , cattle cars and cabooses nearly every imaginable truck type is included dump trucks , oil tankers , cocacola trucks , brinks armored cars and milk trucks many toys were inspired by the construction business , including a pile driver , a dredge on wheels , a concrete mixer , a road roller and a steam shovel for 80 years now the rough , tough vehicles stamped out of the same heavyduty automotivegauge steel as truck bumpers have been staples in america s urban playgrounds and suburban backyards , catherine saunderswatson writes in the catalog for the sale they are infinitely believable , indestructible , generationspanning toys capable of withstanding the weight of a grown man the buddy l toys have been consigned by richard keats , a wellknown new york toy designer who owned buddy l from 1976 to 1990 mr keats went to work for buddy l the day after he graduated from brown in 1948 in our genes , we as adults like all kinds of things when they are reduced to miniature size , whether they are toys , architectural models or patent samples , he said children of course like anything adult that is miniaturized in 1990 mr keats sold buddy l , which is now owned by empire industries of boca raton , fla , and still produces toys during his 52 years at buddy l , mr keats originated new toy ideas and supervised production in east moline , in neosho , mo , and later in asia one of his marketing ideas was to ask national companies to put their logos on the toys firms like buick , firestone , goodyear , wrigley s chewing gum , greyhound , shell and standard oil would pay us for doing their advertising , mr keats said we even got the us postal service although few people had ever seen it , it was known that mr keats had meticulously maintained and updated the company s extensive toy archive , which included the handmade prototypes for toys that never went into production as well as examples of models that did the prototypes are like faberg eggs , mr keats said we had a model of a copper and nickleplated locomotive that was hand assembled with nuts and bolts its wheels move the pistons go up and down it even has a working boiler some of these prototypes took a man a year to 14 months to make no one outside the company saw the archive because it was stored in a concrete building called the morgue in 1976 mr keats moved the contents to a warehouse in clifton , nj he kept the archive after he sold the company , and it has been in hibernation since this inventory will never be duplicated , mr inman said it will be looked back upon as one of the most significant highlights of american toy manufacturing last fall mr keats decided to sell his entire collection because , he said , his storage costs had become prohibitive i had no place to display it and enjoy it , he said it was time to move on he surveyed five auction houses and chose mr inman s he sells more steel toys than anyone else , mr keats said mr inman said the sale was a pretty substantial coup for me mr inman drove an 18foot truck to mr keats s warehouse he loaded it up , mr keats recalled then he filled a van eventually he had to hire another truck , a 54footer , to get all the crates to maine it took seven men five days to unpack the crates at the inman warehouse it was a real walk down nostalgia lane , mr keats said but he is not stuck in the past i'm back designing and developing new toys now , he said they 're just not in steel photo a buddy l tanker , with its original box , part of next weekend

washington , sept 25 the senate narrowly endorsed another round of military base closings today , overcoming opponents who argued that because of the uncertainty of terrorist threats , this was no time to cut back defenses backed by a majority of democrats , the bush administration won a 53to47 vote to establish a new commission to call for base closings and transfers of military units to save money the measure is part of the 343 billion military authorization bill , and because the companion house bill has no such provision , the issue will have to be settled in a housesenate conference the house passed its version of the defense bill tonight on a 398to17 vote after diverting some money from missile defense to counterterrorism under the baseclosing procedure , which has been used several times in recent years , a commission proposes closings and congress votes up or down on the entire package without amendments thirtyone democrats , including senator tom daschle of south dakota , the majority leader , 21 republicans and one independent backed the provision twentyeight republicans , including senator trent lott of mississippi , the minority leader , and 19 democrats opposed it although no senator mentioned the bases in his or her state by name , many of the 47 senators who opposed the plan have major installations in their states senator jim bunning , a republican whose state , kentucky , is the home of two major army bases , fort knox and fort campbell , said , none of us know for certain that we need to downsize our military structure under these extraordinary circumstances the new homeland security cabinet office , mr bunning said , may decide that they need these bases to keep our homeland secure senator byron l dorgan , a north dakota democrat whose state has air force bases at minot and grand forks , argued that establishing a new baseclosing commission , even though it would not act before 2003 , would stunt the economic growth of any community with a military installation but senator carl levin , the michigan democrat who leads the armed services committee and who voted to set up the commission , said it was imperative to convert excess capacity into warfighting capacity michigan is a major military contracting state but does not have significant bases senator john mccain , republican of arizona , argued , there is not a single military expert in this country of any credibility that does n't believe that we need a baseclosing round and mr mccain voted for the commission arizona has fort huachuca , an intelligence and testing center , and two major air force bases in midafternoon , the senate quickly passed a stopgap spending measure that will allow the federal government to continue to operate through oct 16 , while congress struggles to complete action on the appropriations bills that are supposed to be completed by sunday the house passed the stopgap bill on monday , so the senate action will send it to president bush for his signature
west palm beach , fla , oct 9 health officials and federal investigators said today that they had found no new signs of anthrax at a building where two men had been exposed to the disease , but the announcement did little to allay the fears of hundreds of workers at the building and others who live or work nearby so far , officials have not determined the source of the anthrax , which caused the death last week of bob stevens , who worked in the american media building in boca raton federal officials in washington say they have found no evidence of a criminal or terrorist act , but they also say they have no reason to believe that there was a natural cause of the exposure with health officials still awaiting test results of mr stevens s coworkers and other american media employees , fears continued to spread many people rushed to drugstores for antibiotics used to treat anthrax exposure others reported dust from office construction projects to health authorities some worried that a stuffy nose or upset stomach might indicate anthrax exposure i'm actually terrified to find out who has what now , said joanie cox , 23 , an american media employee who was tested on monday and began taking antibiotics today as a precaution fears extended to the palm beach county health department building in nearby delray beach , where health workers are conducting the tests and handing out packets of antibiotics there , workers noticed suspicious footprints and dust in an envelope and reported it to the delray fire and rescue department a department spokesman said that the substance was dust from a construction project in the building but that it was being tested as a precaution so many people are calling things in at one time , said russ accardi , a division chief because of the local situation , everybody s on edge about a dozen businesses and government offices around the state , including a post office in deerfield beach , a bank and law firm in naples , and the st petersburg times newspaper , received envelopes of white powder that the authorities said were being tested but were almost certainly sent as a hoax the bacteria can be easily stored as dry powder , and powders have been used in earlier anthrax hoaxes , according to the federal bureau of investigation it s pretty well known that these pranks are going to happen often , said frank penela , a spokesman for the state health department we 're investigating it in the most thorough way possible even as the authorities urge calm , south florida residents have grown tense since friday , when mr stevens , 63 , a layout editor for the sun supermarket tabloid , died of anthrax days later , spores were detected in the nasal cavity of ernesto blanco , a 73yearold mail supervisor at the sun , which is owned by american media inc , publisher of the national enquirer , the globe and the star supermarket tabloids health authorities also found anthrax on mr stevens s computer keyboard , prompting them to evacuate the offices on monday and conduct tests on all employees and others who have been in the building over the last several weeks results will not be available for several days , said dr jeffrey p koplan , the director of the centers for disease control and prevention in atlanta the findings are needed to help officials of the united states public health service and the federal bureau of investigation determine how the two men were exposed to the bacteria the second man has been ill , but the cause has not been determined anthrax has not been ruled out , dr koplan said today american media executives said today that the possibility of anthrax contamination had caused some to speculate whether terrorists had chosen the company for attack because it is called american media , like american airlines or united airlines they also worried that customers would be reluctant to buy copies of their papers for fear that they might be laced with anthrax the concern prompted david pecker , the chief executive of american media , to request that the disease control centers issue a statement advising consumers that contamination from a newspaper or magazine would be impossible the company s tabloids are printed at six plants around the country none are in florida the mood among the american media staff was one of confusion and , some employees said , paranoia an email message was sent to some staff members saying the chairman of the company had anthrax symptoms but mr pecker said he was fine steve coz , the editor of the national enquirer , said no one had reported being ill today , but reporters and editors were skeptical we 're working out of our houses today and so we 're not hearing much , one reporter said but there is crimescene tape around the building and we feel generally paranoid , like , what does the fbi really know \? and it s employees turning on employees and pointing fingers around south florida , a weary public was trying to cope with fears that largely did not exist a week ago at the community pharmacy in boca raton , people are panicking , said ira protas , the store manager mr protas said his store typically dispensed about 200 ciproflaxocin antibiotic pills a week but had dispensed 600 today alone i had one lady come in today wanting to fill a prescription she had just filled at another pharmacy , mr protas said she wanted to get another 100 cipro pills for herself and her husband mr portas said his customers were nervous and had a lot of questions they do n't understand the communicability of the disease , he said i think the problem is semiuneducated panic dr koplan of the disease control centers said his agency had sent 15 epidemiologists and specialists in environmental health and laboratory medicine to help florida officials test the workers and samples from the building he said the disease control agency and the fbi were conducting parallel investigations , with the centers' role limited to the epidemiologic and laboratory studies investigators have taken swabs from the building near ventilation ducts , soil from the grounds , dust , office equipment and if any test positive for anthrax they will build a threedimensional map to try to recreate the possible routes of transmission , dr koplan said photo an fbi investigative team and firefighters trying to decontaminate the american media building yesterday in boca raton , fla \( colin braley reuters \)
albany , april 5 the state education commissioner today asked local school districts to end the use of american indian mascots and team names , but he stopped short of ordering them to do so in a letter to the presidents of boards of education and school superintendents , the commissioner , richard p mills , concluded that indian mascots and symbols can make the school environment seem less safe and supportive to some children , and may send an inappropriate message to children about what is or is not respectful behavior toward others i ask the boards to end the use of native american mascots as soon as practical , mr mills wrote some communities have thought about this and are ready to act others already have acted , and i commend them yet , in others , more reflection and listening is needed , and so i ask that these discussions begin now there are at least 135 high schools in the state that still have indian mascots or team names , education officials say in recent years , the practice has drawn protests across the country , from california to massachusetts , by people who consider the mascots insensitive more than 600 colleges and high schools have changed their mascots in response , state education officials said the los angeles school board , for instance , has banned indian logos , as have more than 20 school districts in wisconsin mr mills s letter today capped a twoyear inquiry that began when an orange county resident , robert eurich , appealed to the commissioner after the port jervis school district rejected his petition to change the high school s red raider mascot a name used by several teams in the state mr eurich had an unlisted number and could not be reached some indian leaders in new york welcomed mr mills s action , though others said it did not go far enough and left too much discretion to local school boards it came as a surprise to the tribal council , who had anticipated a more clear directive from the state education department , said rowena general , a spokeswoman for the mohawk nation he s passing on that responsibility to the school boards now the school board and the school districts will have to make the decision on the mascot issue , and this issue has divided many school boards and communities ms general noted that the high school in massena , next to the mohawk reservation on the canadian border , still calls its teams the red raiders mohawk children attend the school brian patterson , a bear clan representative on the oneida men s council , said his tribe welcomed mr mills s directive he said the oneida school district still called its team the oneida indians but had abandoned the use of a historically inaccurate picture of a plains indian in a feathered headdress , he said often , indian people are stereotyped , he said the mascots are derogatory and slanderous and misrepresent what indian life is really about in his letter , mr mills rejected calls for a statewide halt to the use of indian mascots , saying such an order was not advisable he argued that local remedies should be exhausted first there are cherished traditions surrounding many of the mascots , he said there are even significant costs involved consider mascots on team uniforms and gymnasium floors some superintendents had hoped the state would take a stronger stand , relieving them of the burden , but instead commissioner mills has left it to local boards to wrestle with an issue that has already proved contentious in the onteora central school district in the catskills , for example , several school board members were voted out of office last year after they retired the school s indian mascot the new board reinstated the buckskindressed mascot that had been in the use since the 1950 s the school s sports fans use a tomahawk chop , and cheerleading chants mimic indian religious songs the school s prom is called the tomahawk dance still , many new york schools have already scrapped their indian mascots or are now talking about doing so in brentwood , on long island , for instance , the high school and a grade school voluntarily jettisoned their indians logo within the last three years the high school mascot is now a bull the grade school chose a bear we felt it was inappropriate and in poor taste , also , said louis brill , principal of branch brook elementary school we 're the bears now the objections to the mascots have grown more strident in recent years professional sports teams like the atlanta braves and the washington redskins have come under fire , but none have changed their names in new york state , several college teams have abandoned their old logos in 1994 , st john s university changed the name of its sports team from the redmen to the red storm in hamilton , ny , near the oneida nation , colgate university is now considering dropping the red from its team name , the red raiders in the 1970 s , the college scrapped the indian mascot that went along with the name the college trustees will consider the name change next month

for that matter , has the aftermath of the sept 11 terrorist attacks recalibrated the public s notions about sports heroes compared with the reallife acts of heroism by firefighters , police officers and medics \? he s less of a hero , but i do n't think that diminishes his appeal , said bob williams , president of burns sports celebrities , in evanston , ill , which matches athletes and entertainers with companies seeking endorsers but it may mute it in the short term jack trout , president of trout partners , marketing consultants in greenwich , conn , said the real issue was mr jordan s relevance in the current sports context he s not a brand that ever went away now it s trying to refurbish the brand , which has faded a bit , mr trout said whether you can crank up that brand to what it once was is a very big question for the sports drink gatorade , a division of quaker oats , the question hardly needs to be answered it is happy with his presence and survived during his absence p j sinopoli , a spokeswoman for gatorade , said , it does n't matter if he does n't excel as he did in the past he s still putting it all out there it s all about will , not just accomplishment mr jordan s association with gatorade yielded the be like mike commercial campaign his 10year contract is in its final year , but gatorade signed him to an extension earlier this year during his retirement , gatorade signed additional athletic endorsers , like derek jeter of the yankees , and the soccer star mia hamm , and employed mr jordan in advertising that showed far less sweat recently , he provided the voiceover for a spot starring ms hamm and peyton manning , the indianapolis colts quarterback mr jordan did not disappear during his retirement his profile in commercials had not evaporated last year , mr williams estimated that his endorsement income totaled 35 million , down from a career peak of 47 million the legend grew bigger by the day , which is why some people counseled and chastised him about coming back , because how much bigger can it grow \? said dave checketts , the former president of madison square garden but i 've never met anyone who can live up to his legend like michael can still , even as replays of his great moves fed the myth , those who capitalize on his name and image could not leverage their products against the sight of new highlights on espn , new records set , fresh quotes in the newspapers in the time mr jordan spent away , young stars like kobe bryant , allen iverson , kevin garnett and vince carter emerged to help nba fans deal with missing him that sabbatical may have split his appeal , mr williams said three years of not playing made him less appealing to kids and teenagers that s more the world of kobe bryant and allen iverson , he said , referring to the young stars of the los angeles lakers and philadelphia 76ers , respectively coming back will raise his popularity with that demographic , but in the 25to49 demographic he s as strong as ever his appeal can now legitimately be with elite , luxury companies peter land , a former nba marketing official who is now the head of sports marketing at edelman public relations worldwide , agreed i 'll be interested in what the teenagers do , he said they gravitate to the newest , the coolest , the hippest michael s not au courant iverson is love him or not , he speaks the language of teenagers rebellious and edgy michael was never rebellious or edgy he was just great mr land suggested that companies like gatorade and nike are in the best position to capitalize on mr jordan s return , because they can show him in the court , doing what he did , even if he is slightly diminished and mr bryant and mr carter will be challenging his airness in his athletic dotage it s michael on the court that wins over fans , he said jon spoelstra , who was the president of the new jersey nets during mr jordan s first nba retirement , said , it s like he s been in a time capsule , and he s releasing himself to us we have terrific memories of him and we 're piqued by curiosity about how well he can play indeed , if mr jordan can closely approximate his old form , he may still be deemed heroic to nbc sports and turner sports' tnt and tbs cable networks , which carry nba games , to the wizards' bank accounts and the coffers of the teams he visits nbc may add as many as 11 wizards games to its schedule \( it now has none \) and tnt and tbs , both parts of turner sports , a division of aol time warner , could carry 14 more , up from the one now scheduled photo michael jordan s return to basketball puts his image on the line \( associated press \)
tokyo , march 1 as japan s government and private industry grapple with immense debts , fresh storm clouds blew in last week from an unlikely quarter theme parks a bankruptcy filing by phoenix resort , a theme park operator , has now cast a harsh spotlight on problems in what japan calls its third sector , enterprises partly owned by local governments the potential fallout could badly set back efforts to clean up both japan s anemic public finances and its floundering banking industry the company , which runs seagaia , a mammoth artificial beach complete with retractable roof and wavegenerating machine , is only one of hundreds of thirdsector enterprises reeling from financial difficulties stemming from the bubble economy of the 1980 s there are 6 , 794 corporations in japan in which a municipal body holds a stake of 25 percent or greater , according to government figures , and nearly onefifth of them are concentrated in the leisure and tourism fields teikoku data bank , which compiles corporate credit data , estimates that more than 7 in 10 thirdsector leisure companies are carrying excessive levels of debt of the 30 theme parks it studied , 16 were technically insolvent why is the country littered with overleveraged municipal theme parks \? because building them was a popular answer to a 1980 s problem criticism at home and abroad that the japanese as a group were doing too much working and saving and not enough relaxing and having fun pressure to step up leisure spending , coupled with the success of tokyo disneyland , touched off a boom in park building it was a time when people had little doubt that theme parks were going to be a growing industry , said shiro komatsu , a research director at the mitsubishi research institute in tokyo the projects also offered regional governments a rare boost in their uphill struggle to attract attention , tourism and investment away from tokyo not to mention creating jobs and profits in the politically powerful construction industry so hundreds of billions of yen were pumped into theme park projects and plans , up to 100 of them at one point it was a time when theme parks were employed as a way to promote the countryside , mr komatsu said naohiko jinno , a professor of economics at the university of tokyo and an expert on local government finance , said that the profits rolling out of tokyo disneyland impelled that thinking they were simply wanting what tokyo had , he said yet as vehicles to promote their regions , the parks that were actually built seem far off the mark many revolve around a tenuously linked foreign cultural theme , including huis ten bosch \( a reproduction of a dutch village \) , canadian world , spanish village , gl cks kingdom \( germany \) and six separate plans for santa clausthemed parks it is no use creating a canadian world in hokkaido , professor jinno said that does not take advantage of a local feature of the region besides misconceiving the parks thematically , many of the regional governments misunderstood the level of financial commitment required to make a park successful , analysts said instead of planning for continuous capital investment to update attractions and keep visitors hooked , they saw them as a onetime project like a new airport or highway as a result , attendance generally dwindled rapidly after the first year or two of operation doomed from the start , these theme parks have begun to collapse under the weight of their debts the troubled ones include canadian world asia park , in kumamoto prefecture and one in fukuoka prefecture puzzlingly named navel land in the case of phoenix resort , the prefecture and city of miyazaki had each invested a modest amount , 75 million yen \( 644 , 164 \) , to own a 25 percent stake but they had also cosigned bank loans of 276 billion yen \( 237 billion \) , more than half of it from daiichi kangyo bank since 1988 , 26 thirdsector corporations have failed , but none owed as much as phoenix resort analysts said that the hard decision to stop propping up phoenix , which has been on financial life support almost since the seagaia resort opened in 1994 , was a watershed event that may prompt other big complexes to seek a settlement with their creditors yet there remains an appetite for new theme parks a new universal studios park , a close cousin to the one in orlando , fla , will open in osaka on march 31 part of the 135 billion yen \( 116 billion \) to build it was put up by the city of osaka , which nurses its own longstanding rivalry with tokyo according to hidehiko sakagami , senior consultant at the japan research institute , it has a better chance for success than most because it is a proven concept but more skeptical analysts wonder if it can draw many visitors from metropolitan tokyo , as it must to succeed the ballyhoo surrounding the imminent opening seems to have made little if any impression on tokyoites , even professor jinno , who said he knew osaka s mayor , takafumi isomura , personally if i had known about it , professor jinno said of the park project , i would have convinced him not to do it photo phoenix resort , a theme park operator , has filed for bankruptcy phoenix runs seagaia , a park in miyazaki that includes an indoor beach \( associated press \)
at sevensomething in the morning , main street in southampton is covered with snow and silence what action there is takes place at the east end of town , over at the golden pear cafe behind windows that steam up now that the temperature is down , several wholesomelooking employees serve up the usual coffee , bagels and muffins , plus a few upscale items like eggs and cheddar in a croissant locally famous in summer as a prime location for celebrity sightings steven spielberg ! alec baldwin ! jerry seinfeld ! the cafe is again the haunt of local workers , who stop between jobs , and whitecollar professionals enjoying some winter solitude even in the offseason , though , there is often a line at the register and customers who come in for a snack sometimes depart as investors in a restaurant company that plans to expand out of its hamptons roots the fiverestaurant golden pear group wants to raise 3 million for expansion and is asking its customers if they would like to share the risk and the rewards if you go to a banker and ask for millions of dollars to grow a restaurant chain , he s going to say no , said keith davis , 37 , who opened the chain s flagship branch here in 1987 so you ask your customers a number have been saying yes two years ago mr davis made a similar equity offer , raising 1 million largely through instore marketing assisted by a small pennsylvania financial firm , first summit securities , mr davis sold onefifth of his business to individual investors and used the funds to open cafes in westhampton beach and stony brook the additions joined existing branches in east hampton , bridgehampton and southampton now , mr davis wants to franchise the cafe and compete directly with companies like starbucks and au bon pain within five years , he said , he plans to franchise 30 stores plus open four additional companyowned locations the initial market will be metropolitan new york mr davis intends to market franchises primarily to whitecollar professionals , said harold kestenbaum , a lawyer in garden city who sits on golden pear s board of directors people with professional backgrounds do n't want to fry chicken , he said , but they are interested in running cafes mr davis plans locations in roslyn , huntington and great neck , plus several manhattan neighborhoods and villages in westchester , connecticut and new jersey he also envisions golden pear kiosks in airports , universities and shopping malls the public offering is being handled under terms of a 1992 ruling by the securities and exchange commission intended to provide small companies with easier access to the public capital markets , said louis perosi jr , president of first summit mr perosi said he had helped mr davis file the appropriate forms with nasdaq and hopes the company will start trading later this year the current plan , mr perosi said , is to raise the money through the sale of 3 , 000 debentures investors can hold the debentures , receiving shares of common stock every six months , and then receive their original investment back upon maturity in five years or they can convert the debentures into stock before that maturity date , with the conversion price rising every year saul and judy sherman of water mill , who stop by several times a week , may be typical customerinvestors the food is delicious , especially because i do n't have to cook it , mrs sherman said marvelous wraps i get wraps or chicken curry my husband gets vegetable chili or chicken pot pie i'm telling you , fantastic more than the vittles , it s the service that impresses the couple the staff look you in the eye when you order , and you get their full attention , mrs sherman said in today s world you do n't get that often it certainly does n't happen in fast food although mr davis describes himself as having a passion for food and had a variety of restaurant jobs as a youngster , he started out on a decidedly different career path , working as an electrical engineer at grumman in the mid80 s , he made a career switch , leaving grumman to manage a specialty food emporium in southampton his plan was to open his own restaurant when the corner storefront on hampton road and main street became available , he leased what seemed a prime restaurant property however , he quickly learned that zoning ruled out a fullservice restaurant so i opened a cafe , he said it was circumstances twelve years ago , mr davis married one of his first employees , who was his pastry chef anne and i now have three kids , and she s still involved in the business , mostly in an administrative capacity , he said the golden pear name reflects mr keith s fruit of choice , which he describes as flavorful and shapely he added , i also think of the name golden pair as describing anne and me mr davis said he considered none of the chefs he worked for to be entrepreneurial role models if you 're asking me who my mentor is , my mentor is jesus , said mr davis , an elder in the first presbyterian church in southampton keith takes his faith very seriously , mr perosi said before he agreed to do business with me , his question was , 'do you believe in god \? ' mr davis also reads motivational books about management and entrepreneurship by such authors as stephen covey and john maxwell , whose messages convinced him that consistency is a supreme business virtue predictability is what makes customers come back time and again , mr davis said consistency is why mcdonald s is the great american franchising success story mr davis said he had been licensed to franchise for several years but waited until he could ensure consistency in taste , quality and distribution the vegetable chili i serve you in stony brook on friday has to taste just like the vegetable chili i served you in southampton on monday , he said herbert feiler , a lawyer in manhattan who often visits the east end , became an investor after stopping in for a light lunch and seeing the investment flier if i like a product , i sometimes invest in the company , and this was a product i liked , mr feiler said while the hamptons connection has been a plus for mr davis , he plans to scale back the local touches when he begins franchising many people know the hamptons as i do , a place of unspoiled ocean beaches and beautiful farmland , he said other people hear 'the hamptons' and think 'loud and pushy' when we start franchising , we 're not going to emphasize the location we 're going to emphasize the concept but he said the slate of locally named sandwiches like the sagaponack , a concoction of roast turkey , brie , tomatoes and lettuce for 695 will stay on the menu and the celebrities who crowd into the east end branches will most assuredly not be banished nor will the fashion models , who are not always welcome at cafes and restaurants because owners fear they will order tiny small portions actually there are a lot of models from europe here in the summer , mr davis said they go through two or three chocolate croissants at at a sitting you ought to see how much they eat photo keith davis is president of the golden pear group , which is looking for investors for a 3 million expansion mr davis plans to francise his cafe and compete with starbucks \( maxine hicks for the new york times \)
the american economy may or may not be in a recession but the information technology industry surely is , with no sign of an upturn lately , silicon valley , fabled for its invention , its cando mentality and its dotcom fever , is looking a lot less fabled for two hours last monday , four veterans of the valley craig r barrett , the chief executive of intel judith l estrin , a serial entrepreneur who is now chief executive of packet design inc mitchell e kertzman , the chief executive of liberate technologies and eric e schmidt , chairman of novell and google , met at the garden court hotel in palo alto to discuss the state of the hightech world asking the questions of these executives , who sit on the boards of eight other companies , all told , were john markoff , matt richtel and judith h dobrzynski of the times overcapacity and its probable longevity was on their minds so were intellectual property issues , the lack of interest in technology among american students and the lack of interest in innovation in the valley , frustration with wall street analysts and popup ads on the web , even their inability to get broadband in their homes following are excerpts from the conversation judith h dobrzynski q what s the mood in silicon valley \? when do you think you might get out of this downturn \? barrett i'm more concerned about synchronous world recessions than i am in what s exactly happening in silicon valley or the us , even the economy s relatively weak , obviously , in the us , in the hightech sector it s weak in europe it s actually pretty strong in latin america it s strong in the emerging asian economies india , china , for example over all , we 're all operating at one plateau level down from where we were six to nine months ago kertzman booms , big booms , are really followed by very small slowdowns many of us are taking out our old what do you do in a down business cycle chops and managing our businesses that way as opposed to , oh my god , this is the end of the world estrin i think that the past five years was the anomaly , not now a set of very real technology issues pc s , cellular , the internet that should cause a boom , coupled with overreaction and kind of overexuberance , and then throw the y2k buying on top of it what we 're seeing now is somewhat a normal overreaction to overreaction on the other side the reason this is so hard is because the technology industry is such a young industry you have so many managers , technologists , analysts , spectators , press that have never seen anything else their careers started in that 10 years as technology became it and so now everybody s like , oh my god , because they have n't seen anything else schmidt things may actually be worse than we 're saying you had this enormous overbuild that occurred in telecommunications , which was largely vendorfinanced you have all of the issues around pc market saturation in certain key markets you have windows xp as the next great white hope there you have these incredible physicists who work at intel who continue to build new processors , faster and faster and the value proposition is n't necessarily there for the whole solution the next killer app has not yet evolved on top of that you had the internet , which is the world s biggest opportunity to hype something because everyone could see that it was transformative so you have this enormous overbuilding , which will take a fairly long time to overcome it s overbuilding at the software level , at the systems level , at the infrastructure level , at the fiber optic level meanwhile , the technology continues to get better i think the slowdown could be quite a bit longer than all of us would like it to be barrett we have this tremendous overbuild but none of us can get broadband to our home estrin typically , when you 're in a time like we are now , what gets you out of it is some new technology , some real breakthrough that is not incremental we have a lot of work to do on the internet if you look at the next three to five years , it is good incremental , but it is incremental progress it s not the cell phone where the cell phone did n't exist it s not pc s where pc s did n't exist schmidt i know what it was unfortunately , it was napster napster went from zero to 50 million users in six months if that s not a killer app , i have n't seen one recently unfortunately , it happened to have this mild problem that it was illegal so it shows you that there at least was a path , unfortunately an illegal path estrin too much was done over the last five years without thinking about business models and thinking about making money and the problem with napster is the same problem with too much of the initial push into the last mile there was no business model for doing it q are you concerned about the studies that suggest that people who do n't use the internet see no use for it , or that if the adoption of the internet matches that of the tv , it s going to be 30 years before a lot of people get the internet \?

the spanishlanguage television network univision has been putting up billboards all over new york city one in particular struck me , given the census figures showing hispanics to be the country s largest minority it called univision as american as flan \( flan , for those americans devoted to apple pie , is a custard \) the ad made me wonder about the significance of this newest challenge to the american melting pot the appearance of the univision signs reflects the growing importance of the hispanic market the census figures have awakened politicians as well everyone is looking for hispanic votes president bush became the first president to deliver a white house address in spanish as richard rodriguez wrote on this page , mr bush seems to be seeking the title of our first hispanic president at the other end of the political spectrum , the rev al sharpton has offered his sufferings in jail as a gesture of solidarity with puerto ricans demanding that the navy abandon its military exercises on the puerto rican island of vieques the catholic archbishop of san juan addressed a joint session of the new york state legislature , while gov george pataki has joined other mainland politicians in traveling to puerto rico to demand the end of the vieques bombing apparently as a result of hispanic pressure , president bush decided , against the advice of many military experts , that the navy would leave vieques in two years sometimes it looked this year as if the puerto rican day parade had as many politicians carrying the flag of vieques as it had salsa dancers and on its cover , time officially welcomed us to amexica none of this is particularly surprising in a nation of immigrants actively supporting political causes back home while rapidly assimilating into the dominant american culture still , modern hispanic immigration differs from past waves unlike the irish , italians and eastern europeans , hispanics can come and go easily , thanks to the proximity of lands of origin means of social communication , like univision , allow them to remain in constant contact this cultural continuity is strengthened and protected by the present emphasis on multiculturalism and bilingual educational programs and by the growing use of spanish in government and private industry the interesting question is whether all this constitutes something so unusual that the hispanic presence could someday make a significant difference in the dominant culture there is no one hispanic culture across the latin nations puerto ricans , dominicans , mexicans , salvadorans and cubans can be as culturally different from each other as the varieties of europeans remain culturally distinct , despite efforts at political unity the issue , however , is the situation not in latin america , but here in the united states it is in the united states that the consciousness of being part of a single hispanic world absent in latin america has been emerging as varied hispanic peoples experience identical conflicts with north american culture these conflicts occur at a level much deeper than the economic or political they involve different ways of perceiving , evaluating and standing before reality itself such conflicts are essentially religious , since religion originates in the experience of the meaning and sense of life this religious sense is the most important factor in the emergence and endurance of cultures and however various hispanic cultures may be , they have a common origin in the encounter between 16thcentury iberian catholicism and the religiosity of the inhabitants of this continent \( in many parts of the hispanic world , this cultural formation also includes african religious traditions \) the dominant north american culture , however , has at its root the encounter between angloprotestant religious convictions and the enlightenment these two worlds seem fundamentally incompatible a mexican friend of mine , pursuing a degree in a mexican institute associated with an american university , tells me that lecturers from the united states teach that if mexico really wants to join the first world , it must shed catholic attitudes that stand in the way the conflict between cultures shaped by latin american catholic experience and the dominant american culture can be seen in the puzzlement of conservatives and liberals pursuing the hispanic vote for example , conservatives find that hispanics share with them important social values but support liberal views on the role of government in assisting the poor positions that have their origin in catholic social thought this body of doctrine does not regard private property and its economic benefits as absolute goods they are subject to the good of society the state has an obligation to ensure that inequalities do not keep the poor from obtaining employment with a fair wage and finding adequate housing , health care and family assistance in the last decades , due in large part to the influence of latin american catholicism and the struggles over liberation theology , the church has embraced what is called the preferential option for the poor , which sees meeting the needs of the poor as the moral measure of economic policies at the same time , catholic social doctrine recognizes the private sector as the creator of wealth and limits state intervention to cases of injustice which other social institutions have failed to resolve the latin catholic view also insists that the spiritual life be recognized as part of the social good according to the census , around 70 percent of hispanics identify themselves as catholic this does n't mean that each one is a practicing catholic many are , in fact , abandoning the church in favor of protestant evangelical communities \( a catholic friend , invited to the white house for a meeting between hispanic religious leaders and the president to discuss faithbased social assistance , told me that the overwhelming majority of those present were evangelical leaders \) this trend could eliminate the historically rooted experience among hispanics of being a catholic people it would , indeed , lead to the assimilation of hispanics into protestant american culture and so weaken the possibility of a distinctly hispanic influence on american life for the time being , however , 70 percent of american hispanics identify as catholic , and that is not a small number unless the population share drops dramatically , it seems that hispanic cultural influence will largely be guided by a catholic social view but we cannot seriously imagine that this outlook will triumph over the dominant culture after all , it is , in part , the benefits of this dominant culture that attract immigrants what could happen is the creation of a new cultural mix that will bring together presently incompatible attitudes will the catholic church in the united states see the hispanic presence as an opportunity to offer a way of forming a cohesive community that could transcend divisions between liberal and conservative politics \? unfortunately , efforts by hispanic catholic leaders in the 1970 s and 80 s to move the church to challenge the individualistic priorities of the dominant culture seem to have lost momentum under the demands of a secularist multiculturalism that is essentially static at the same time , because protestantism is so much at the root of mainstream america , hispanic protestants cannot have a transformative effect on their new country without a basis in their uniquely latin american catholic experience , hispanics may find their influence in the united states will indeed be no more significant than a taste for flan drawing \( peter kuper \)
fifty years after its completion on april 22 , 1951 , the product of a threeweek typing marathon said to have been stoked by benzedrine and coffee , the scroll on which jack kerouac composed on the road is to be auctioned on may 22 at christie s in manhattan the singlespaced quasiautobiographical ode to free living is nearly 120 feet long and pasted together in sections about a dozen feet long , the seams later reinforced with tape a faint pencil line runs along its right edge , suggesting that kerouac cut the paper to fit his typewriter darkened with age , the scroll is tattered near its beginning , probably from handling \( kerouac was fond of showing it , unrolled and roadlike , to friends \) and its final paragraphs are torn away , a mishap that kerouac attributed to his friend lucien carr s dog chewing off the end the scroll s consignor is tony sampas of pepperell , mass a nephew of stella sampas , kerouac s third and last wife , he inherited the scroll from an uncle , anthony g sampatacacus , who died in december 1999 he is the executor of his uncle s estate and is the joint beneficiary of the scroll with another uncle , john sampas , and sampatacacus s longtime girlfriend , nancy bump the scroll needs to go into the public , tony sampas said of his decision to sell it has been locked up in a safe , it has been rolled up for decades , and it s an important work it needs to be studied by scholars and by ordinary folks he added we have a financial imperative i have to settle an estate , and we have some bills christie s estimates that the scroll will fetch 1 million to 15 million on the road is one of the elemental texts of the beat generation and remains popular today the book has sold nearly 35 million copies in the united states and continues to sell at a rate of 110 , 000 to 130 , 000 copies a year , a pace that has increased slightly since 1991 , when steady annual sales of 25 , 000 quadrupled in one year i would place kerouac in the same league as kafka , joyce and proust , and we have sold manuscripts of all of those authors for substantial sums , said chris coover , senior specialist in manuscripts at christie s the scroll was kept in the vault of the sterling lord literistic agency until about 1993 and resurfaced at the new york public library several years later , mr coover said it was moved from the library to christie s in january and is being studied by conservators at the pierpont morgan library in manhattan christie s plans to exhibit the scroll in chicago and san francisco in early may , and it will be on view at the auction house beginning around may 17 on the road was closely based on the crosscountry wanderings of kerouac and his friend neal cassady , a charismatic drifter , as they traversed the highways of postwar america and mexico armed with a rucksack filled with small notebooks , kerouac verbally sketched scenes from everyday life , concentrating on what he considered the neglected cities of the west , where he imagined himself a sort of sundance kid to his companion s butch cassidy the book s seemingly endless strands of rhythmic prose echoed the jazz kerouac loved and heralded its author s belief that he had discovered a new form of writing both spontaneous and unrevised i really wrote a great book , my very best , one of the best to be published this year anywhere \( or next jan \) and wrote it too in 20 days as i say and i feel the pull and strain of having to type with a rusty typewriter like this and a dull ribbon that wo n't enact my tones , kerouac wrote to cassady on june 10 , 1951 in fact , it would take six years to get the manuscript published , during which kerouac met with forceful rejections , beginning with the reaction of robert giroux at harcourt brace how the hell can the printer work from this \? the editor is said to have roared mr coover surmises that within the first year , kerouac retyped the scroll onto conventional pagesbut the manuscript was still summarily turned down by several major new york publishers , perhaps partly because of its glorification of car thieves , con men , hobos and prostitutes , and its unconventional style finally , malcolm cowley of viking agreed to edit the book , but only after kerouac submitted to substantial revisions and agreed to get signed release forms from its characters eventually , kerouac assigned aliases cassady became dean moriarty , the poet allen ginsberg appeared as carlo marx , and kerouac christened himself sal paradise in a review in the new york times in 1957 , gilbert millstein hailed its publication as a historic occasion and called on the road the most beautifully executed , the clearest and the most important utterance yet made by the generation kerouac himself named years ago as 'beat , ' and whose principal avatar he is the historian douglas brinkley , who is writing a kerouac biography for viking , said i find the scroll one of the really fascinating documents of 20thcentury american literature there is such a mythology grown on the coffeeandbenzedrine frenzy in which he produced the scroll but , he cautioned , a lot of the mythology is inaccurate

on oct 29 , 1999 , ira monas , a long island investment adviser who had been convicted of grand larceny and possession of forged documents in a securities fraud case , entered the adirondack correctional facility at ray brook , ny , to begin serving a term of two to four years as new york state inmate 98a5992 in the next two months , using only a phone in a common room , federal prosecutors said yesterday , mr monas made almost daily calls to two investment firms he owned , directing subordinates who apparently did not know that he was in prison to promote sales of securities in three initial public offerings that were widely regarded as hot investments he called collect , and to mask the raucousness of inmates in the background , he said he was in europe or at a terribly noisy restaurant and while he had no access to the securities he was promoting , federal prosecutors said , about 200 investors sent 85 million to bank accounts he controlled the investors , caught up in a feeding frenzy of internet ventures and ipo s , thought they were buying soaring shares of united parcel service fogdog , an internet sports equipment merchant and freemarkets , an online auction vendor but all they ever got , the prosecutors said , were pieces of paper that appeared to be confirmation slips and officiallooking account statements meanwhile , hundreds of thousands of dollars the investors had sent in went to pay mr monas s personal and business debts , while 42 , 000 was used to buy a mercedesbenz for his daughter and millions more wound up in bank accounts that he controlled , the authorities said none of the investors' funds were used to purchase securities for the investors , mary jo white , the united states attorney in manhattan , said as she released a threecount complaint against mr monas , 55 , of massapequa , ny mr monas appeared before a federal magistrate on friday and was to be released today on a 1 million bond to the custody of his former wife , rita the complaint did not accuse the companies mr monas controlled , or any of his subordinates or employees , of any wrongdoing , and federal officials said it appeared that the employees from securities sales personnel to secretaries who typed up account statements had been misled into aiding his scheme mr monas s lawyer , stephen scaring , would not comment on the case in detail , but said his client has not acknowledged any responsibility for involvement in this complex scheme the government has outlined , but is looking forward to defending himself james flateau , speaking for the state department of correctional services , noted that the state s 71 , 000 inmates were free to make collect phone calls during free time in the common rooms of new york s 70 prisons , and that they make about 22 , 000 calls every day and while it is illegal for inmates to conduct business from prison , catching them doing so is difficult , even though many of the calls are monitored and recorded the case of michael mathie , an inmate at elmira correctional facility who claims to have traded more than 8 million in securities since 1998 and had an adjusted gross income of 899 , 969 in 1999 , was reported earlier this month , but state officials said he had merely managed his own money and had not engaged in any illegal business activity another unusual investor , 15yearold jonathan lebed of cedar grove , nj , turned an 8 , 000 savings bond into 285 , 000 in 1999 and 2000 by using a bedroom computer and the internet to promote stocks he had invested in the securities and exchange commission stumbled onto the boy s case during an investigation into mr monas s dealings mr monas , officials said , had given the boy false information about companies whose stock the teenager had promoted it was that inquiry , officials said , that led to mr monas s conviction and imprisonment in 1999 at the time , said a complaint by a federal investigator , john p keelan 3rd , mr monas was the sole owner of milan capital , a melville , ny , investment advisory service he was also the undisclosed owner of ac financial , a brokerage firm with offices in palm harbor , fla , and pittsburgh , which he acquired through secret transactions that placed a relative in nominal charge , the complaint said in october 1999 , mr monas became one of 700 inmates at adirondack , a mediumsecurity prison mainly for nonviolent offenders he delegated management of milan capital to its vice president , michael lamhut , who was told that mr monas had gone to europe for health reasons during his free time in the common room , mr monas made frequent calls to mr lamhut and instructed him to arrange conference calls with the manager of the pittsburgh branch of ac financial , prosecutors said through these contacts , mr monas gave instructions for promoting the sale of securities in three initial public offerings in late 1999 for ups on nov 10 , for fogdog on dec 9 and for freemarkets on dec 10 each was widely reported in the media as a 'hot' ipo , meaning that they were oversubscribed and the securities difficult to purchase , ms white said monas allegedly told the branch manager of the pittsburgh office that ac financial access to the ipo securities was a result of special relationships that monas had developed with goldman sachs and morgan stanley , the lead underwriters on certain of the ipo s , the prosecutor said neither goldman sachs nor morgan stanley , however , actually dealt with mr monas or his firms as 85 million rolled in from 200 investors , the complaint said , the money was funneled into accounts controlled by mr monas , and much of it was later used to pay his personal and business debts the complaint said about 37 million of the funds was frozen by a federal court as the investigation drew to a close mr monas , after having served less than 17 months , was paroled on feb 15 , state officials said but as he left the prison that day , he was arrested by federal authorities , who were waiting for him , on charges of securities fraud perpetrated while behind bars

in 1849 , while composing his 15th opera , luisa miller , giuseppe verdi insisted that its heroine should be both ingenuous and extremely dramatic luisa s vocal and theatrical demands , like those of violetta in la traviata , swell as she evolves from the ing nue of act i to the tragic heroine of act iii it may be , in part , the difficulty of finding a soprano who can embody these paradoxical traits that has relegated luisa miller to the margins of the repertory the metropolitan opera has now found a luisa of sufficient vulnerability and valor in the russian soprano marina mescheriakova , who will star in the new production of the work that opens on friday evening marina is the verdi soprano we 've all been waiting for , said the director , elijah moshinsky , who has realized verdi s domestic drama in the style of an english novel and its heroine as a sort of operatic jane eyre there s a warmth and freshness in her voice and personality that mark her out for this repertory the tenor neil shicoff , ms mescheriakova s leading man on this occasion and several others , seconded mr moshinsky s opinion with her extraordinary legato , ravishing pianissimo and communicative gifts , marina was born to sing verdi besides , she s a fun colleague and a great stage kisser at 34 , ms mescheriakova has already emerged as one of the met s most important verdians after an imposing debut as elisabetta in don carlo in 1997 , she returned the next year as amelia in simon boccanegra last season , she managed to shine in the met s roundly censured production of il trovatore , and while in town , she sang an unforgettable verdi requiem with the swedish radio orchestra in avery fisher hall in march , she will return to the met for her first alice ford in falstaff it s true , it was n't easy , ms mescheriakova said of the met trovatore one recent afternoon in her sunny subleased apartment a few blocks from lincoln center but we were so well prepared that when the first night came , i felt comfortable i was used to all the skirts , and the sets were not a big surprise so my heart was totally broken , because i believed completely in everything we were doing still , she added with a guffaw more reminiscent of the lusty alice ford than of the hapless luisa miller , i had a big compliment from some critics who said i reminded them of scarlett o'hara while she basks in the perks stemming from glasnost , ms mescheriakova realizes that she narrowly missed the fate of previous generations of russian singers during the soviet era , the conservative , statesupported bolshoi opera stood as a trophy of communist culture , indenturing all the best singers in the ussr , and international travel was tightly restricted ms mescheriakova s voice teacher , yelena shumilova , who died in 1995 , had been a leading dramatic soprano at the bolshoi during that time ms mescheriakova s own beginnings were stereotypically soviet she was born in 1967 in volgograd , an industrial city in southwestern russia , the only child of a shoe factory manager and an electrical engineer , who were both enthusiastic amateur singers her mother led her to the piano from the age of 5 i practiced six , seven hours every day , but i never took it seriously , ms mescheriakova said but my mother was very strict i did n't have very straight posture at the piano , so she made me tie my legs together with my young pioneers scarf then her priorities shifted i was about 11 , she said i was playing something i think it was a mozart minuet and suddenly it touched me so much i almost cried , and i played nonstop all day at that moment i understood that i could do nothing else with my life though she earned a diploma in piano pedagogy , her first love was singing i was not shy at all , she said i 'd sing in public transport , in stores , just because i thought 'well , i have a voice why not \? ' at 19 , ms mescheriakova moved to moscow to enter the tchaikovsky conservatory as a voice major since i was a pianist , i understood musical style , but i did n't have any vocal technique , she said i always thought it was very easy you just open your mouth and sing then you see it s much more complicated but once you learn these complications , then how easy it is ! shumilova , passing on the italianate vocal technique she had learned from acolytes of the renowned garcia family , treated her young soprano gently , focusing on high , light repertory my teacher was very conservative , ms mescheriakova said for two years we only vocalized every day , nothing else ms mescheriakova made her first operatic appearance as the soubrettish susanna in a school production of le nozze di figaro her professional debut , as antonida in glinka s life for the czar at the bolshoi opera , came in 1992 in a video of that production , she brims with health and promise , holding her own beside such veterans as the bass yevgeny nesterenko and the conductor aleksandr lazarev
okavango delta , botswana , dec 20 in the beginning , there were the rushing rivers , the whispering reeds , the kwa ! kwa ! of shrieking herons and the rumble of lions when the wayeyi people drifted here some 200 years ago , they thought they had found paradise they settled in huts along the green marshes and built canoes to glide through the twisting streams they fished , harvested water lilies and named the animals , flowers and stars in their language , shiyeyi first , first people to come here are wayeyi and bushmen , said baagi letsapa , 54 , as he guided his canoe through the sleepy waterways he is a leathery man who still remembers the teachings of his father he knows that the boiled roots of the sage plant help ease indigestion , that papyrus makes the best sleeping mats and that the ukayi plant produces a poison that kills fish , but not people this knowledge is disappearing as young people abandon the rivers , the canoes and the old ways but not without a fight here in the swamps of northern botswana , the wayeyi are battling against the erosion of rural traditions and indigenous languages that has followed the relentless creep of urbanization and assimilation across the african continent this country is dominated by the tswana people , and for generations smaller tribes have been discouraged from asserting their identities to promote a sense of national unity but two years ago , the wayeyi took the government to court to demand formal recognition as a tribe and to demand that their dying language be taught in schools critics said they were inflaming tribal tensions and trying to salvage the unsalvageable all across southern africa , young people have migrated to towns and urban teenagers groove to the hiphop singer wyclef jean , teeter on platform heels and gleefully meld english and african languages into a boisterous slang that rattles some grandparents a new generation rolls its eyes at village traditions but a few weeks ago , the high court handed the wayeyi a startling victory the court struck down the law that recognized the existence of only tswana tribes in botswana it ruled that the law unfairly discriminated against the wayeyi and was therefore unconstitutional the judges did not order the government to start teaching shiyeyi in schools , citing the fiscal implications of such a shift but they acknowledged that by granting equality to all tribes in botswana , large and small , the court might be setting the stage for such changes in the future as word of the judge s decision spread , the elders started celebrating some dared to dream that the wayeyi might someday see their very first representative take a seat in the nation s house of chiefs , which serves as an advisory board to the government others started to believe , for the first time , that they might actually save their vanishing traditions and language it s not just about our chief it s about our identity , said lydia nyatiramahobo , dean of education at the university of botswana , who helped prepare the paperwork for the lawsuit against the government our language was dying , said ms nyatiramahobo , who is also the coordinator of the kamanakao association , which promotes the language and customs of the wayeyi the culture was dying now there is hope for a renaissance in the nearby town of maun , an annual festival celebrates traditional dancing and music there is a shiyeyi calendar and a shiyeyienglish phrase book that includes a smattering of history for tourists and for young people who have forgotten their roots the book reminds readers that the bright star that signals the start of the fishing season is traditionally praised as nyena mayiwa , mother of the sun elephants are known as wadjovo leopards are called wangwe to offer friends and relatives good luck , the wayeyi traditionally blew into each other s ears this week , the caretakers of culture gathered under a tall tree to share their stories they were old men with silver hair and fraying shoes some had crooked legs and trembling hands others had straight backs and powerful voices all had hope in their eyes the elders described the discrimination they had encountered from more established tribes they described being dismissed as a backward people , feeling ashamed of their origins we had no voice , explained jacob moeti , a 64yearold traditional leader we were not a people who could stand up and speak and expect anyone to listen we were looked down on even now , people are afraid to say they are wayeyi but we have now stood up and the courts have now heard us , he said we hope the equality will now make us equal as a people the old men grinned and some cheered someone chimed in , the struggle is not over ! but in many ways , the gathering of old men only made it clear how much has been lost the village elders all conversed in setswana , the language of the dominant tswana none spoke more than a word or two in shiyeyi these days , only a few men still use the traditional skills that were passed from generation to generation in their everyday lives mr letsapa is one of them when he was a boy , his father taught him how to navigate a canoe today , he ferries tourists through the swamps mr letsapa says he is proud of the new push to preserve the old ways but as he drifted through the swamp , he confessed that he was doubtful that young people could be lured back to their traditions my son stays in town , mr letsapa said he does n't want to come here in town , they do n't know canoes they know the car only me , i like to speak shiyeyi it s my language , he said but the young people now , they do n't want to use shiyeyi and i do n't know if that will ever change photos baagi letsapa , 54 , above , in the marshes of northern botswana , learned traditional ways from his father a wayeyi elder , below , was among several at a village meeting who recalled being dismissed as backward \( rachel swarns the new york times \) \( greg marinovich liaison , for the new york times \) map of botswana highlighting the okavango delta the wayeyi came to the okavango delta some 200 years ago

the new economy seems to have lasted for three years from about 1997 until late 2000 , economic pundits proclaimed that a new era had begun technology , they said , was making america s companies more productive , allowing the country to grow quickly without causing inflation but when a slowdown occurred with almost no warning , and goods piled up in warehouses and stores , businesses cut spending and laid off workers none of it seemed very new anymore during the last month , new economy has appeared in a sample of 10 large newspapers 27 percent less often than it did six months ago , a database search showed that is true even though those same newspapers are publishing much more economic news today than they were last autumn it would be a mistake , however , to consign new economy to lexicographical history last week brought clear evidence that the concept of a changed economy still had true believers alan greenspan and his colleagues at the federal reserve , who lowered interest rates on wednesday for the fourth time in about 100 days in their announcement , the fed s policy makers said the impressive productivity gains of recent years remained largely intact despite the slowdown but businesses are now investing less in new equipment consumer spending , after holding up fairly well in january and february , has weakened , threatening to remove the final barrier to recession with its move , the fed hoped to persuade people to be a little looser with their money a few million beach vacations here and a few thousand new manufacturing plants there , and suddenly the economy would be growing at a healthy pace again the size of the task , however , should not be underestimated the fed is trying to effect a shift in attitude that has not been accomplished in the last 30 years go back to last summer , when americans' optimism about the economy came close to a 50year high , according to the university of michigan in the nine months since , michigan s index of consumer confidence has fallen from 1083 to 878 , the lowest since 1993 even as the good feelings have waned , consumers have been willing to spend at a fairly brisk pace , and analysts have said that the contrast cannot last long it is a remarkable gap , said neal m soss , an economist at credit suisse first boston but the only way for its outcome to be remarkable would be for the economy to avoid a recession since 1969 , the index has dropped by at least onesixth on seven other occasions a recession followed , or was under way , every time in each case , the pattern was similar , said richard t curtin , michigan s director of consumer surveys as the media talked of economic weakness , people looked for evidence they followed the news and talked to friends but if they were shopping for a new car or house , they continued as if nothing had changed at the first whiff the economy may be weaker , people are not going to reverse all of their plans , mr curtin said instead , he said , people cut some marginal spending , say , for restaurant meals if they hear about layoffs among their friends or cannot work as much overtime as they once did , they become more conservative those who have debt begin paying it off this is the chain of events that occurred in each of the past recessions in the third quarter of 1979 , for example , consumer spending rose 38 percent , even though the confidence index had dropped 25 percent below its late1978 level by 1980 , spending was falling , and the downturn was under way mr curtin says the current gap has received an unusual amount of attention because information circulates more widely now when michigan s index began to drop sharply late last year , television and newspapers paid far more attention than they had to previous declines it raised the expectations for an immediate drop in spending , and that did n't happen , he said fed officials also say that information flow is different now and that the outcome will be , too mr greenspan has said that companies today can react to changes in business conditions faster than their predecessors did as the economy slowed last year , they cut production sharply those reductions played a crucial role in consumers' new pessimism this time , however , the cuts will not last for months corporate america took its medicine and , with lower interest rates encouraging spending , the economy can return to growth in the second half of 2001 if the plan works , the fed will have defied recent history in that case , one might even say there is a new economy chart since '69 , confidence has declined sharply within a year several times , including these april '90oct '90 319 july '78july '79 267 feb '73feb '74 245 feb '69 feb '70 205 aug '81march '82 197 july 2000 to present 189 \( source univ of michigan \)

in 480 bc , near salamis off the coast of greece , an armada of perhaps a thousand persian ships attacked some 300 greek vessels this was , as the military historian and classicist victor davis hanson writes in this provocative book , one of the most deadly battles in the entire history of naval warfare lured by a brilliant greek strategy through the narrow straits , and rammed by greek ships , hundreds of persian vessels were sunk more than 40 , 000 persian soldiers were drowned or killed but mr hanson , who teaches at california state university in fresno , says this battle is more than just a textbook example of warfare herodotus pointed out that many of the persian fighters were mercenaries or slaves any soldierly hesitation was typically punished by beheading free citizens , herodotus argued , made better warriors more motivated and more flexible the greeks were fighting , as aeschylus pointed out , for their freedom the persians , out of fear or greed for mr hanson , these differences were not only evident at salamis mr hanson also examines nine battles extending over 2 , 500 years , including the defeat of the romans by hannibal in 216 bc the battle between christians and muslems at lepanto in 1571 the massacre of the british by the zulus in 1879 and the confusion of the 1968 tet offensive of the vietnam war in his view , the distinctive characteristics of western culture ran through each of these battles western armies tended to rely on warriors who were not mercenaries but free citizens with something personal at stake the mixture of discipline and autonomy led to a particular style of engagement unlike the persians , the aztecs , the zulus , the ottomans and the japanese , who brutally enforced absolute obedience , western fighters have been relatively free to react to shifting events this flexibility helped determine the american victory in the bloody battles against japan at midway in world war ii , mr hanson says it also permitted debate before , during and after battles , debate that has given western accounts of military history extraordinary variety and authority in addition , individualism and innovation , partly spurred by economies freer than those of opponents , led to the invention of weapons that have been adopted by every major military force in the world in many of these battles , of course , western culture could also contribute to its own defeat hannibal and his motley army took advantage of what mr hanson characterizes as western assault strategy to kill 50 , 000 roman soldiers in 216 bc in vietnam , the tet offensive was widely considered a western defeat \( a mistaken judgment , in mr hanson s view \) , partly because american planners completely ignored the tenets of the entire western military heritage the western tradition of dissent , he suggests , also overwhelmed that heritage but mr hanson asserts that in the west , defeats have not been final they have led to introspective revision rome rose again the experience of vietnam led to decades of analysis in his interpretation , mr hanson combines two visions of the west that have themselves been at war during the last 30 years the celebration of the west for its democratic vision of human liberty , and the condemnation of the west for militarism and imperialism the tendency is to see these positions as incompatible mr hanson argues that the reverse is true they are inseparable democratic ideals have led to greater military power adherence to structures of constitutional government , capitalism , freedom of religious and political association , free speech and intellectual tolerance , he says , has produced a soldier who can kill like none other on the planet these characteristics have made war between western countries among the bloodiest , but have also led to the triumph of the west in making this argument , mr hanson joins a group of scholars who do not explain western dominance as a result of modern imperialism jared diamond \( in guns , germs , and steel \) sees geography and environment as the primary influences on the development of western technology and power david s landes \( in the wealth and poverty of nations \) argues that differences in cultural values and social organization made the difference mr hanson disagrees with mr diamond but amplifies mr landes s argument , suggesting that culture , however admirable , creates a very deadly reality in the outcomes of war the west , he writes , possesses a weighty and sometimes ominous heritage in which its manner of war ideally serves , rather than buries , our civilization military historians will have to analyze mr hanson s accounts indeed , not everything is convincing in his generalizations mr hanson also does not successfully address the nature of modern guerilla warfare , the nature of islamic triumphs , the wide variations among western nations or the ways in which western strategic style grows out of western culture but after sept 11 , other issues come to mind while reading the book even applying mr hanson s interpretation , the culture of western warfare is being tested against a very different kind of opponent certainly , western individualism and improvisation could remain important his view of western military technique could arguably be found in october s swift frontal assaults of air power on specific targets and disagreements about strategy among the leaders of the war hidden or forbidden in many other societies have already become the subject of public debate yet given the international reach of the enemy , its networked cells , the absence of a traditional battlefield and the resilience of terrorist passions , that military heritage may be challenged both the defense department and the rand corporation have already called for a structural revision of the military by creating decentralized networks better prepared for new forms of battle it may be that in this case not only will western culture influence styles of war , but styles of war will also begin to transform western culture carnage and culture landmark battles in the rise of western power by victor davis

the flux quartet s curious program at the miller theater on saturday night was billed as offering new american visions only half the music , though , was american , and none of that was new , which left rather little space for the visionary presumably the players were playing what they wanted to play , but their criteria were mighty hard to discern their repertory ranged from the agile , imaginative and lightfilled first quartet of the highly gifted british composer philip cashian to the snarling textures and slow glissandos of elliott sharp s twistmap john zorn s kol nidre , referring to the jewish prayer , found this mercurial musician sounding like an arvo p rt from another tradition , with a slow chorale of beautiful widespaced chords , while oliver lake s input was an unfortunate mistake a frame of zealously abstract quartet music around an improvised solo from the composer on sax , with stray string accompaniments that were immediately obliterated also in the mix were a group of transcriptions and audio realizations by an australian collective , slave pianos , based on sound creations by visual artists , including bill viola and george maciunas , the founder of the fluxus movement of the 1960 s maciunas s piece , in memoriam ariano olivetti , was a joke , but the flux players told it well , bringing gusto to the rude oral noises that first interrupt and then overwhelm the pizzicatos with which the thing had begun perhaps hardest of all to understand is the quartet s continuing commitment to the french composer renaud gagneux , whose second quartet they were introducing to this country the work had nice moments , notably the finely scored flourish at the end of the middle movement but it also included sequences of scrubbing such as encourage these very talented and energetic musicians to throw caution and nuance to the winds photo the flux quartet , from left , tom chiu , cornelius dufallo , darrett adkins and kenji bunch , playing at miller theater \( hiroyuki ito for the new york times \)
by thursday morning , zina garrison was exhausted she had spent three hours wednesday , from 6 to 9 am , talking via satellite with a halfdozen morning television programs around the nation she talked about her appointment last month as the first africanamerican woman on the board of the united states tennis association she talked up the game of tennis , the need for youth programs garrison , who played 16 years on the women s tour , spent wednesday afternoon at the bronx international tennis center conducting a clinic for players from the new york junior tennis league but the crowning moment of her trip to the new york area took place tuesday morning in east orange , nj , at the althea gibson early childhood academy garrison represented gibson as wheaties unveiled a special edition black history month package commemorating the career of gibson , the only africanamerican to win the french open , in 1956 , and the first one to win wimbledon and the united states championships , in 1957 and 1958 gibson , who is 73 , rarely makes public appearances now , and garrison is one of the few people who maintains regular contact with her when i was unveiling it , i actually started thinking about how long it took , garrison said though just the idea they would finally do it now and she had the opportunity to actually see it was pretty emotional for me especially when i heard her talk about how excited she was about having the box she does n't get excited about much of anything anymore in many ways , garrison , 37 , is the emotional bridge between gibson and a generation of young africanamerican tennis players she suffered less than gibson but still carries scars for me tennis was the best thing in my life and the worst thing , garrison said i was consistently analyzing everything around me , people and motives , but i never really got to totally enjoy it being africanamerican at that , there was always so much expected i was always very aware of that , to the point that i think it took away from my personality i was never able to just be myself as difficult as coping with racism may have been , garrison s retirement from the court in 1997 was devastating athletes making a transition is never easy , i do n't care who you are , garrison said she said others knew she had a deeprooted problem before she did i'm walking down the street and , literally , strangers would come up and say , smile' i remember clear as day walking down the street in houston and this homeless guy walks up and he says 'life is not that bad smile' i thought i was feeling fine , she said when i looked in the mirror everything looked ok to me but obviously what people saw was something different because it kept happening to me over and over then i found myself a month later not wanting to get out of bed garrison won 14 tournament titles on the women s tour she is 19th on the career money list she won the gold medal in doubles and took the bronze in singles at the 1988 seoul olympic games in 1990 , she became the first africanamerican woman since gibson to reach a grand slam final , advancing to the wimbledon final against martina navratilova none of that was strong enough to bring me out of the way i was feeling at the time , garrison said the only thing that was strong enough was my faith in god there was a point at the depths when she even doubted the higher power i thought that he abandoned me , she said in my mind you must remember , i had no hope , i had no belief the epitome of feeling in darkness even to the point that i would actually pray sometimes i would say 'why would you do this to me \? ' the last 18 months have provided a revitalization , a renewed sense of mission garrison is raising money to build an indoor tennis center in houston , her hometown she continues to pour time into her own foundation , which supports charitable organizations , and into a tennis program her appointment to the usta board brings her tennis career full circle her greatest triumph , however , is her victory of the spirit my sense of mission right now is to get up positively every day , she said i thank god every morning just to be able to get up i know that sounds like something you hear all the time , but being in a place i was a year and a half ago , i'm very grateful for that my serious will to live and to motivate myself from day to day and be the best person i can possibly be is truly what wakes me up every day it s been a long time since i 've been in this spot , she said i'm happy to be here photo zina garrison has made her best comeback \( george m gutierrez for the new york times \)

they sought an explanation but got none this is unbelievable , rafael hernandez , the uncle of the dead woman and her sister , said outside the station house i do n't know what to say we 're destroyed they 're insulting us an assistant brooklyn district attorney , james e lamb , had requested that bail be set at 500 , 000 , arguing that a test performed at the scene had shown that officer gray s blood alcohol content was 02 percent , or twice the legal limit the officer subsequently refused to take a breathalyzer test , mr lamb said he told an officer on the scene , 'i was drinking , i was on my way to work , and they darted out in front of me , ' mr lamb said judge david i schmidt ordered officer gray released on his own recognizance he left the courtroom through a back door , escorted by court officers judge schmidt , a brooklyn civil court judge who was sitting in brooklyn criminal court , gave no reason for his ruling , but a legal expert said it was not unusual for police officers to be released without bail because they were generally seen as upstanding members of the community who posed little risk of flight officer gray was immediately suspended from the force , without pay police officials said that officer gray , a 15year veteran , had no prior disciplinary record and had never been declared unfit when reporting for duty they said he had been expected to report to duty at the 72nd precinct station house on saturday at 11 30 pm , two and a half hours after the accident the accident occurred as officer gray drove his burgundy ford windstar van north on third avenue , under the gowanus expressway overpass witnesses said that as mrs herrera crossed the avenue at 46th street with her son and her sister , the van struck them , sending their bodies sailing into the air when the van came to a stop a halfblock farther north , witnesses said , the boy was trapped beneath its front bumper , and the bodies of mrs herrera and her sister had been thrown to the side of the road , where their blood pooled around discarded bottles and trash two witnesses said the pedestrians had the right of way the light was red , hector velazquez , 40 , a construction worker , said yesterday in an interview he did n't stop for nothing not until he dragged that boy with him another witness , rosa cintron , told the police that the walk signal was visible when the family crossed freddy roman , a nearby resident who heard the crash from his backyard and went to the scene , said yesterday that officer gray , who was not in uniform , was slurring his speech and staggering no one answered the door yesterday at mr gray s cottagelike home in the closeknit community of mariners harbor in staten island , and relatives who appeared in court for his arraignment did not speak to reporters but several neighbors described him as a helpful man who was often seen working in his yard or playing with his three children all said they had not seen officer gray abuse alcohol no one seemed to know where mr gray was just before the accident his lawyer , stephen worth , would not comment on the specifics of the case joe asked us to pass along his condolences to the family , he said it s a great tragedy the three victims were taken to lutheran medical center , where doctors tried for hours to resuscitate andy herrera , said myles davis , a senior vice president of the hospital they had also tried to save mrs herrera and ms pe a , although neither had vital signs on arrival , he said with mrs herrera in cardiac arrest , doctors decided to deliver the baby boy she was carrying about 2 30 am , a team of doctors and nurses maneuvered the tiny infant s incubator into an ambulance and headed for new york presbyterian hospital in upper manhattan , which mr davis described as better equipped to handle infants in critical condition the baby , who the family said was to be named dorian , died there at 10 30 yesterday morning about that time , much of the victims' family was gathered in mourning in a small threebedroom apartment on 46th street , near the intersection where the accident occurred maria alta gracia pe a , 56 , sat in her dark kitchen under a creaking fan , near the two sewing machines with which she makes her living before the accident , she had been the mother of 11 children yesterday , there were 9 at the mention of officer gray s name , her sad face twisted into scorn i do n't have forgiveness for him i think he should be sent to jail for the rest of his life officer gray faces three counts of manslaughter , three counts of vehicular homicide and charges of driving while intoxicated , reckless endangerment and reckless driving if convicted , he could be sentenced to up to 15 years , said a spokeswoman for the brooklyn district attorney s office he also faces similar charges within the police department , which could result in his being fired , a police spokesman said it was not immediately clear whether he could be

from the first moment jeanette burmeister appears in the full monty , the audience knows this is a woman who has lived a little there she is , her shaggy head in her beatendown hands , sitting behind an old upright piano , looking every bit the weary stage veteran then she lifts her head and speaks you talkin' to me \? burmeister asks in a rasp , somewhere between the sounds of edith bunker and travis bickle a few moments later she adds , i'm ready to rock 'n' roll and just like that , you sense that the crowd s favorite character has arrived the reasons for the audience s love affair with jeanette include her spunk \( she is thrice divorced and ready to jettison no 4 \) and , even more , the expert comedian bringing the role to life the 70something character actress kathleen freeman , who , like the salty old piano player she portrays , seems to have been just about everywhere and worked with just about everyone the proverbial veteran of stage , screen and television , ms freeman has had a career spanning more than 50 years , from a oneline turn as a brooklyn schoolgirl in the 1948 filmnoir classic the naked city to her current gig in the musical monty on broadway at the eugene o'neill theater it is a role that the show s creators , the composer david yazbek and the playwright terrence mcnally , added late in the writing process it does not exist in the 1997 movie about six hardluck , softbodied male strippers that inspired the broadway musical but ms freeman said she immediately understood the part , a character whom she refers to as the seventh monty it s the kind of character that not everybody was right in tune with , she said on a recent chilly matinee afternoon but she s been around , and god knows i have ms freeman s resume is peppered with the names of famous movies , and names of the stars that made them that way among the classics and classic stars on her curriculum vitae singin' in the rain \( she played jean hagen s frustrated voice coach \) the far country , with james stewart the nutty professor , with jerry lewis and north to alaska , in which she played a drunken swede with john wayne \( i had a great accent , she said , doing it again did n't i \? \) her linguistic talents notwithstanding , ms freeman s true specialty has always been her deadpan , a talent once described by walter kerr in the new york times as her ability to sit on a line , to isolate it and nail it to the floor it is a skill that , if her recent broadway fans can be trusted , seems to have lost none of its bite despite a halfcentury of use i think i'm a living example of the fact that you do n't have to be in every inch of a film or play to be important to it , she said matteroffactly and let s be candid here i never felt any great personal beauty i guess i was awfully pretty at some point , but funny was always my book true enough , ms freeman may not be garbo , but with a sneaky smile , a friendly , frizzy head of graying hair and a sharper wit than most leading ladies have , she definitely makes better company her manner is part wiseacre and part wise old aunt during an hourlong interview , she offered opinions on everything from show business to her particular avidness for life she rarely laughs at her own jokes that s the audience s job , after all but more than anything , ms freeman is an oldstyle actress , with all the class and custom that implies asked what her favorite role was , she responded , the next one asked what she thought of her current show , she said , i think mr mcnally has made a great work of this she refuses to give her exact age , for fear of its connotations and disputes several film reference books that say she is 80 i used to lie about my age , making myself older for roles , she scoffed and they took me seriously ms freeman s fierce addiction to the footlights probably is not her fault the only child of a husbandandwife vaudeville team , dixon and freeman , she grew up on the road , performing alongside her parents in the dying days of her family s songanddance act i would sing a song like i knew what i was doing , she said apparently i did n't after the act folded , ms freeman ended up in california , where she eventually attended the university of california at los angeles , studying music there she made her first foray into plays after a classmate begged her to appear in a production of a roman classic ms freeman said she could not remember the exact title , but she did remember the exact moment she first spoke a terrible thing happened , she said , in mock horror i got a laugh smitten , she began to pursue acting full time and soon began performing with the circle and the players ring theaters in los angeles in 1948 she went to an audition and landed a bit part in the naked city , the truelife story of a brutal new york killing ms freeman played a girl on the subway whose only line didja read about the bathtub murder \?

in the early 1830 s , it occurred to the belgian critic f j f tis that the life of the legendary violinist niccol paganini would make good reading the portrait of the artist as star and superstar has been a turnon for publishers and a wellplowed field ever since to stick with violinists , in 1908 andreas moser produced two monumental volumes on his mentor , the great joseph joachim from the 1930 s to the 60 s , frontline performers like albert spalding and joseph szigeti pitched in with informative and interesting memoirs over the next few decades , much of the menuhin family , including wife , father and a cousin as well as yehudi menuhin himself , got into the act recent specimens include biographies of fritz kreisler , mischa elman and maud powell , and firstperson titles by isaac stern and gidon kremer jascha heifetz , who was born 100 or just possibly , 101 years ago and was a minimalist by temperament , was never a likely candidate for a memoir or an easy one for a biography keep it short , he once told an interviewer 'born in russia , first lessons at 3 , debut in russia at 7 , debut in america in 1917' that s all there is to say , really but of course it s not what distinguished paganini , according to one contemporary , was the unconventional way he tuned the instrument , an idiosyncratic bowing technique , the combination of bow and lefthand pizzicato , a weakness for harmonics and a general standard of virtuosity that left all other players in the dust what distinguished heifetz , by comparison , was a command of the fundamentals as perfect as joe dimaggio s swing or the form of an egg the perfection began with the happy accident of birth that endowed heifetz with reflexes and smallmuscle coordination faster and more responsive than those of any other famous violinist , according to the critic henry roth but the efficiency of the left hand moving horizontally on the fingerboard the vibrato ranging from zero to glassshattering intensity , with all intervening degrees the bow technique that could deliver a phrase of mozart , brahms or gershwin , or even of a lesser light like vieuxtemps , bruch or glazunov , the way laurence olivier delivered a line of shakespeare each of these was acquired heifetz then maintained them all his life by the same daunting regimen of scales , tudes and creative practice that he later demanded of his students a classroom video from his teaching days at the university of southern california offers an example a student is invited as a warmup for chausson s po me , a favorite concert piece to play the intimidating scale of g flat in still more intimidating fingered octaves the challenge would cause whole sections of violinists in major orchestras , and many aspiring soloists , to reconsider their vocation but it was no more than heifetz asked of himself what resulted was a figure at once thrilling and chilling since 1917 , audiences have come to take the heifetz performance perfection for granted , roth noted but in 1917 , such perfection was not only unknown , it was undreamed of it was sometimes claimed that the violinist , who went on stage and did his job with glacial selfabsorption for more than 60 years , played coldly but anyone who could believe that after hearing him would probably find a laser beam cold to gauge from heifetz s long artistic shadow , and the number of memoirs and biographies about predecessors and contemporaries who stood and still stand in it , one might at least expect something like humphrey burton s good , new 561page biography of menuhin , complete with index , bibliography and notes yet it is what has not been written about heifetz that is truly remarkable in fact , his younger son , jay heifetz , says that a major new york publisher once signed up a former secretary of heifetz s but the designated author died prematurely , after some 300 interviews , and no successor has ever appeared one consequence is a curious memory hole 14 years after his death , a generation after his last public performance and some 100 years after his birth in vilna , russia , now vilnius , lithuania as fashions change , popular attention wanders and contemporaries die , it is entirely possible that there will never be a standard biography in any case , writing one would not be easy heifetz was notably selfprotective and singleminded the conflicted birth date already hints at the problems awaiting a serious biographer between the baltic coast in the reign of czar nicholas ii and the reaganesque coast of southern california 86 or 87 years later heifetz s discographers john maltese and john anthony maltese suggest that his mother subtracted a year when no one was looking if true , this would hardly make a federal case in the world of the prodigious that was jewish russia , younger invariably trumped young many parents fudged the reference works nonetheless stand firm on 1901 , and the family stands with them though by default , jay heifetz admits

while new jersey drivers prepare to slow to a crawl when using their ezpass cards at statehighway tolls , critics of the system are revving up protests that new guidelines that go into effect tomorrow are defeating the purpose of the program starting tomorrow , ezpass users in new jersey who travel through toll plazas faster than five miles per hour will risk losing the electronic tags that are supposed to make it easier and quicker to pay tolls on the garden state parkway , the new jersey turnpike and the atlantic city expressway it is not that the ezpass scanners cannot read the tags when cars go through the tolls at higher speeds the issue , ezpass officials said , is one of safety coming at a time when motorists are increasingly turning to ezpass , the new regulations are intended to safeguard toll booth employees and drivers who may be at a standstill in the toll plaza , officials said the new limits mirror similar ones in new york , where 13 , 427 warning notices were issued to motorists in 1999 for speeding through toll booths but the new crackdown , the first since the installation of the ezpass system was completed on all of new jersey s toll roads last year , has attracted its share of critics , who say slowing to a crawl defeats the purpose of the system drivers are going to be real angry , said stephen g carrellas , the new jersey representative for the national motorists association , which successfully fought to raise the 55mileperhour limit on national highways this is so against the principles of ezpass , which is to help ease your way through the congestion at toll plazas , he said they 're going to start losing customers the association has started a lobbying campaign to persuade elected officials to do away with the fivemileperhour limit another group , the tristate transportation campaign , is calling for a 45mileperhour limit for motorists going through the plazas the tristate organization is also supporting a bill , sponsored by state assemblyman alex decroce , that would speed toll collections by replacing toll booths on the garden state parkway with an overhead camera system to record tag information as traffic whizzes by but until any such laws come into existence , drivers will have to slow down considerably when they come to the plazas speeders will be detected by the same ezpass technology that charges tolls to drivers' accounts on the first two offenses , drivers will be sent warning letters on the third offense , ezpass privileges will be suspended for 60 days on the fourth , they will be suspended for 180 days , and on the fifth offense , the tags will be revoked ezpass officials said that none of the violations would be reported on a motorist s state driving records , and that there would be no monetary penalties i want ezpass users to get to their destinations in a safe and timely manner , said edward gross , executive director of the new jersey turnpike authority , which administers the ezpass system going that extra few miles an hour slower is not going to add significantly to their trip time , but it may keep them from ending up in a hospital mr gross was vague when asked at what speed drivers would be sent warning letters i have no intention of sending warning notices to motorists who go six or seven miles an hour , he said i'm not going to disclose at what speed we will send out notices the purpose is to send a clear message to drivers to slow down dramatically when they come to the plazas the ezpass system has become hugely popular in new jersey lynn m fleeger , director of public affairs for the new jersey turnpike authority , said there were 729 , 000 ezpass accounts and 33 million tags in circulation and use is growing on the turnpike , she said , 54 percent of all those paying tolls now use ezpass but accidents at toll plazas are also increasing they are up 3 percent from a year ago , ms fleeger said neither she nor mr gross could provide specifics about whether ezpass was to blame one reason for the forced slowdown in new jersey is that the ezpass system , which is now in place from west virginia to massachusetts , was installed mostly on existing toll roads , many of which already had booths staffed by tolltakers on lanes about 10 feet wide , said terry o'brien , a spokesman for the new york thruway authority , which also uses ezpass in other parts of the country , where there are newer highway systems , highspeed lanes dedicated exclusively to users of the electronic tag system have no such obstructions in houston , for example , or denver , with its expresstoll system , drivers may maintain regular highway speeds as they pass under cameras hanging from steel beams high above the traffic these lanes have no booths , gates or traffic lights to slow them down mr o'brien said his agency was working to install more highspeed toll lanes but , he said , it s an infrastructure issue it costs money to build them in new jersey , mr decroce said it would cost about 120 million to install the systems used in denver on the garden state parkway his bill proposing such a move is awaiting approval from the assembly appropriations committee photos starting tomorrow , ezpass users in new jersey will have to slow down at toll plazas \( keith meyers the new york times \) \( pg b1 \) officials say a speed limit will increase safety

it has been a tumultuous year for providers of highspeed internet service three companies that offer it over phone lines filed for bankruptcy so did the leading provider of highspeed internet service over cable tv systems , excite home and the largest cable company , att broadband , spent much of the year trying to decide its future before finally falling into the arms of comcast last week while each of these events had some effect on customers , nothing has deterred an increasing number of americans from signing up for highspeed or broadband internet access despite the recession and the demise of many of the providers , broadband is one of the technologies that consumers continue to spend money on , said jed kolko , an analyst with forrester research given the choice , they will upgrade to broadband before they buy a new pc some 107 million of the nation s households now have broadband access , representing about 16 percent of all households online , according to the yankee group research firm a year ago , 56 million homes had broadband access , or about 10 percent of online households and some research firms put the penetration of broadband even higher 20 percent , according to recent surveys by both forrester and nielsen netratings cable companies continue to hold an edge over phone companies in the broadband market the yankee group calculates that 68 percent of broadband users connect by cable , while only 31 percent use the phoneline variant , called digital subscriber line , or dsl the rest use various satellite or wireless technologies that are far more expensive and of interest mainly to customers in rural areas that have not been wired for cable or dsl service cable service has had a head start in most areas , is available to more customers and generally has been less frustrating to install then again , none of the dsl companies that are bankrupt northpoint communications , covad and rhythms inconvenienced as many people as the 850 , 000 att customers who were cut off at least temporarily recently after a dispute between att and excite home aol time warner , whose america online service is the leading provider of dialup internet access over conventional phone lines , has been a laggard in offering highspeed service even though aol time warner is also among the nation s largest operators of cable systems america online which provides content , email and instant messaging offers a version of its service via dsl in many areas , but analysts say this has had very little success in the market this fall it started introducing a highspeed version over the systems of time warner cable david burstein , an industry consultant and editor of the dsl prime newsletter , estimates that america online , which has about 30 million subscribers , has lost two million customers to cable and dsl broadband providers once some customers start using a different provider for broadband internet access , mr burstein said , they may no longer see the need to continue paying for america online s content and messaging services but robert w pittman , cochief operating officer of aol time warner , said aol was satisfied with the adoption rate for its highspeed services aol never aimed at the techie early adopter users , he said it took three or four years for more than half of our customers to start using 56k modems , he said , referring to modems with speeds of 56 , 000 bits a second , which replaced earlier models with slower speeds \( broadband systems can transmit data at speeds of 500 , 000 bits a second or faster \) mr pittman said that just because a consumer signed up for a rival dsl or cable broadband service did not necessarily mean that aol would lose the customer some four million aol members use aol s software \( which links to its email system and content \) even while using other companies' highspeed networks for basic internet access with a majority of those customers paying aol s 2390 monthly fee \( and the rest paying a cheaper 995 plan \) , they are a very profitable clientele because such customers place little demand on aol s network capacity mr pittman declined to say how sales were going of aol s fast service on time warner s cable markets , other than to say that adding aol , as well as its rival , earthlink , did not seem to slow down sales for time warner s existing highspeed brand , road runner mr pittman said demonstrating that multiple highspeed services did not necessarily cannibalize existing offerings would be critical to convincing att comcast and other cable companies to allow aol onto their systems a key goal of aol time warner , now that it has lost out in the bidding for att s cable business so far , however , earthlink appears to be more aggressive and seemingly more successful in its broadband offerings than aol has been as of the end of the third quarter , earthlink had about 200 , 000 dsl customers , 90 , 000 cable customers through charter communications , and 116 , 000 customers through various broadband offerings from sprint
lagos , nigeria freshly hired reporters were typing away on a recent morning , sitting before shiny blueandred computers , as editors huddled nearby at the end of the day , they would put out another issue of the anchor , one of several new newspapers in the newly democratic nigeria even in this still uncluttered newsroom , however , there were reminders of the old nigeria , where newspapers and military dictators fought a singularly fierce battle over the future of the country , home to one in six africans and possibly the continent s most swashbuckling press as the editors' meeting ended , the oped editor came out , hobbling the publisher , adewale adeeyo , caught sight of him , and explained that he had been imprisoned under military rule he was a normalwalking man before , mr adeeyo said the deputy editor in chief , niran malaolu , came by , prompting the publisher to say , and look at him !

every year at this time , as he has done since 1998 , state assemblyman alexander b grannis heads to albany and proposes an odd bill for a unusual place the place is roosevelt island , and the bill would bring selfgovernment to those residents roosevelt island is one of the oddest patches of earth in the city , one hell of a confusing mess , quite frankly , as h patrick stewart , a longtime resident who loves the place , puts it the city owns the island , the state runs it under a 99year lease and the nineperson governorappointed board for the roosevelt island operating corporation runs it with revenues from rents , parking fees and tram and bus fares the more than 8 , 000 people who live there , many in mitchelllama buildings with controlled rents , say they are the only ones who have no say in the island s affairs it s undemocratic , said matthew katz , president of the roosevelt island residents association , the major community group island residents have none of the input in running their community that other neighborhoods have the bill proposes that instead of the governor s appointing the board , seven members would be elected by island residents , the mayor would appoint two other residents , and two state officials would hold seats the new board would hire a manager to run the island \( managerial duties are now done by the president of the operating corporation , who is appointed by the governor \) to ensure that a new board does not inherit an island with a crumbling infrastructure , the bill requires the state to help finance capital repairs , as well as new capital projects costing more than 250 , 000 what we 're seeking has no precedent , said mr grannis , a democrat whose district includes the island the goal , he added , is for a public benefit corporation to be transferred entirely out of state hands and turned over entirely to an independent board the movement for roosevelt island independence began at a rally of residents on july 4 , 1997 a few days later , when the operating corporation refused to give the group a meeting place , they gathered under a maple tree and named themselves the maple tree group their main demand was local control over development on the island but now yet another idea is in the air under this approach , the city would retake the island and bolster its already shaky municipal services i do n't want to accuse the city of being good business people , but they do know how to run a city and a neighborhood , and the state does n't , said mr stewart , 67 , who is a member of the operating corporation board members of the maple tree group , however , said ceding the island to the city would strip away its unique features mr grannis and a fellow democrat senator olga a mendez , who is sponsoring similar legislation in the state senate , will introduce their bills in the next few weeks ms mendez plans to meet with representatives of the governor and the senate majority leader to seek a compromise that might have a chance of passing island residents are ready it s our home , mr katz said if we fail , it s our home that fails andrew friedman photos alexander b grannis \( david jennings for the new york times \) \( susan farley \) chart at a glance do n't look down the tram to and from manhattan may be roosevelt island s most famous feature tram opening date may 1976 total tram trips , as of nov 16 , 1999 17 million number of passengers since opening 30 million capacity of gondola 125 people round trips daily 120 \( weekday \) cost per ride 150 cost of construction \( 1976 \) 5 million distance from water at highest point 250 feet distance from station to station 3 , 100 feet average time of trip 4 or 5 minutes top speed 16 miles per hour

las vegas , nov 10 when the nation s republican governors gathered here this weekend for their annual meeting , they put the best face they could on last tuesday s elections in which democrats reclaimed the governor s offices in virginia and new jersey and they mostly glossed over the possibility that democrats might lengthen their victory string next year when 36 more governor s races are held , races in which more republican than democratic seats will be at risk but there was no glossing over when the 16 governors who showed up there are 29 republican governors in all took up the first two issues on their agenda terrorism on the rise and an economy in decline they spoke of unemployment rates that have increased by a third or more in recent months , especially since sept 11 , with the outlook for things to get worse before getting better they told of state budgets that have slipped close to or into the red , requiring special legislative sessions to make painful adjustments the governors recounted how they had been struggling to come up with plans to thwart terrorism attacks or to respond to attacks they might fail to thwart not plans to handle things like fires or floods or stuff we already know how to handle , and handle well , said gov frank keating of oklahoma , but things we 've never , ever had to handle , and nobody else either , like anthrax and smallpox they asked the federal authorities to share more intelligence about terrorist threats with them to help them improve antiterror planning they called for better coordination of federal , state and local public safety efforts , arguing that ultimately state and local defense was not up to the federal government or the pentagon but was the responsibility of state and local authorities and sometimes they vented frustration gov william j janklow of south dakota , having heard talk about the rounding up , jailing and trial of terrorists , grabbed a microphone and blurted we 're in a war , with people who want to kill us and somehow we 're still taking about 'arresting' them and 'bringing them to justice' i do n't get it we need to kill them until the rest surrender no lawyers and no courts then we need to capture their leaders we can try them and then kill them governors applauded the governors mostly chose to see the democratic wins in virginia and new jersey as aberrations victories over struggling , lesserknown , outspent republican candidates by democrats who often sounded like republicans as they ran i'm not sure there is anything more to it than that , no great themes , said gov john g rowland of connecticut as for next year s races , the governors insisted , by and large , that there was no need to worry so long as president bush s approval rating stayed up and the economy did not collapse and as long as progress was made in the war but several republican consultants and pollsters who briefed the governors warned against relying on president bush s popularity his big numbers do n't necessarily mean that you 're safe , do n't necessarily provide a protective umbrella , said bill mcinturff of public opinion strategies group mike murphy of murphy , pintak , gautier and hudrome , recalled that in the 1942 elections after the pearl harbor attacks , democrats lost many seats in congress despite president franklin d roosevelt s huge personal popularity it s one thing to rally around the president and something else to rally around a party , mr murphy said we 've got to work on our own message despite such warnings , the governors remained upbeat about 2002 we think we are in quite good shape , said gov james s gilmore 3rd of virginia mr gilmore also is republican national chairman , a job he may lose given tuesday s losses but little criticism of him was voiced here , and some colleagues went out of their way to defend him he s our best fundraiser , none better , said gov john hoeven of north dakota we need to keep him around photo gov william j janklow of south dakota was among 16 republican governors who attended a gathering in las vegas this weekend \( associated press \)
norman rockwell a life by laura claridge illustrated 546 pages random house 35 would norman rockwell have been as happy , or successful , if he had painted only to please himself instead of pursuing fame and fortune as an illustrator \? the question hangs over laura claridge s engrossing if spongy biography of this artist for two reasons because it never ceased to haunt rockwell , prompting crises of selfdoubt , painting trips to paris and even reenrollment at the art students league , where he studied as a teenager and because rockwell , who kept abreast of modern art and admired both pollock and picasso , surely had the ambition , as well as the focus , sophistication and intelligence to be a great artist all he seemed to lack was the courage and confidence to be unadored and uncompensated while waiting for success to strike the question of whether rockwell was an exorbitantly talented illustrator or a grossly underrated painter has been debated regularly since the early 1920 s , when his saturday evening post covers began to make him america s bestloved artist it has been revived by the current rockwell retrospective at the guggenheim museum but the debate seems beside the point rockwell s achievement is both smaller and larger than art smaller because of the timidity , regressiveness and constrictedness of his work larger because his art is a fact , symbol and symptom of american popular culture , and as inextricable from it as irving berlin s and walt disney s , even if it was not as innovative rockwell created an indelible image of smalltown america as it never existed , but his art is here to stay ms claridge s book is the first comprehensive biography of rockwell , and , one hopes , not the last a tighter , more penetrating , less fawning study is called for , better to analyze the material presented in this one but there is plenty to work with years of press coverage a vivid , if glossy autobiography a 10year analysis with none other than erik erikson , whose diagnosis was that the artist had painted , rather than lived , his happiness good use is made of thoughtful interviews with surviving friends and family members , most helpfully the artist s three sons rockwell s life , which began in new york city in 1894 , is a biographer s dream of triumph , tribulation and orderly progression the emotional deprivation and social instability of his childhood hardwired into him a precocious , singleminded drive for love and attention \( and money \) that became subsumed entirely within his work he was supporting himself as an illustrator by age 18 and painted his first cover for the saturday evening post four years later , in 1916 his needs fueled an exhausting schedule , an inability to refuse almost any assignment , advertising campaign or product endorsement and a lifetime of missed and postponed deadlines the three acts of rockwell s adult life were set by his closely spaced , markedly different marriages , which dovetailed conveniently with the flow of american history during the roaring 20 s , he led a life of gatsbylike glamour in new rochelle , ny , with irene o'connor , a dedicated materialist who left him just weeks before the 1929 stock market crash then came his 30year marriage to mary barstow , a stanfordeducated schoolteacher 14 years his junior who provided the semblance of the rural , allamerican family life pictured in his art \( they lived in arlington , vt , and then stockbridge , mass \) mary s almost frantic overidentification with her husband s work and wellbeing evolved into a kind of selfsacrifice as their sons grew up and rockwell s celebrity reached stratospheric levels during and after world war ii , she descended into alcoholism , weekly shock therapy and medication , and died of a heart attack in 1959 at 51 his last wife was mary leete punderson , a stockbridge neighbor who oversaw the most serene period of his life and also encouraged him to act more publicly on his liberal political beliefs , both in life and art ms claridge ranges far , often in a circular fashion that repeats points and phrases and has the lax tone of a hollywood biography but she gives impressively detailed accounts of all facets of rockwell s life , including his family background and its emotional baggage , friendships with other illustrators and nervous dealings with magazine editors and art directors she charts the psychological roots of rockwell s emotional remoteness , lack of introspection , and the irresistible charm and studied humbleness that inspired both his loyal public and his almost obsessively devoted studio assistants while sympathetic to his emotional dilemmas , she also has a cleareyed vision of the psychological damage he left in his wake ms claridge is less convincing in her strident overdefense of rockwell s art she knows that some of his pictures are better than others , and notes his tendency to overwork his surfaces , push his facial expressions toward caricature and load his paintings with detail but she continues to inflate his reputation by stressing his affinities with rembrandt , vermeer and de hooch , when the more important precedents seem to be the lesser preraphaelites and 19thcentury american genre painters like eastman johnson and william sidney mount she oversimplifies the art world as dominated by abstraction long before it was , but fails to draw comparisons with successful figurative painters like edward hopper her casualness with facts is often disconcerting thomas hart benton and george bellows are placed at the art students league decades before rockwell s arrival in 1911 , although bellows began teaching there in 1910 and benton had not yet moved to new york the canyon ranch spa , which , according to its current manager , did not open until 1989 , is cited as one of the attractions of the stockbridge area at the time of the rockwells' move in 1953 and she is given to blithe , slightly nasty unverifiable generalizations about art savvy art historians , realizing that the majority of celebrated modern artists from monet to jackson pollock underwrote their bohemian , anticommercial posture with someone else s money , have long smiled at the romantic myth of the starving artist one comes away from this book feeling that rockwell was an amazing storyteller who happened to work in images , making paintings that were instantaneously legible and technically breathtaking but it did n't make him vermeer any more than michael jackson s physical genius makes him diaghilev in addition there s the possibility that erikson was wrong , that the cramped , wizened nature of rockwell s art and its overcontrolled compositions , surfaces and emotions reflected his depression accurately maybe he did , in fact , paint his unhappiness photo norman rockwell \( associated press \)
paris , dec 5 opening the door just a crack to a new era of cooperation in fighting crime , the united states and the european union are to sign an agreement on thursday to exchange information on terrorism and other serious offenses secretary of state colin l powell is expected to attend the ceremony to emphasize its importance but the agreement , to be signed at a meeting of the union s justice and interior ministers in brussels , does not allow europol , the fledgling paneuropean police agency , to share personal information with american investigators that excludes names , photographs and addresses of suspects , criminal records , names of associates , names of witnesses and many other facts that any detective would find crucial to investigating a crime it allows the sharing only of technical information on serious crimes tips about threats , crime patterns , weapons or smuggling routes used by criminals , lists of assets that might be frozen and so forth nonetheless , personal data is already exchanged between the federal bureau of investigation and the individual police forces of most countries , so all that is legally missing for the moment is the bureau s ability to do onestop inquiries in europe by calling europol in fact , in a special exception that treats the sept 11 attacks as a lifethreatening situation , europol has been sharing personal information in that investigation with the fbi by , for example , helping it crosscheck telephone numbers in europe called by the hijackers my sense is that this is institutionalizing a practice that de facto exists anyway , said jonathan stevenson , a terrorism expert at the international institute for strategic studies in london to be able to do that regularly on all the crimes europol has jurisdiction over trafficking in arms , drugs and people , moneylaundering , counterfeiting of the euro and terrorism a legal agreement must be formed talks on a secondary agreement to legalize the sharing of personal information are to begin immediately that will be , not difficult , but a careful exercise , said willy bruggeman , the deputy director of europol , because our dataprotection standards are higher than those of individual countries for example , information gleaned from undercover work must be carefully sanitized to protect both the undercover officer and the people being watched under the new agreement , the two sides may also put liaison officers in each other s offices europol is not an investigative agency like the fbi it is only two years old and has about 350 employees , none with arrest powers the fbi has 29 , 000 europol is a clearinghouse for information from the police of the european union s 15 member countries it is supposed to spot trends and encourage the formation of joint investigative teams thus far , a europol official said , germany , britain and belgium have shared with the agency all their information on investigations into the sept 11 attacks france , spain and italy , where there have been other roundups of suspects , have not yet done so , he said also under discussion this week at the brussels meeting of justice and interior ministers is the development of arrest warrants that would be valid anywhere in europe those discussions are going slowly , an american official said some countries are balking at the idea of giving up their own citizens to other european countries , though they would honor a warrant for a citizen of a third country others are hesitant to make their laws defining various crimes exactly congruent with those of other european countries but the justice ministers were ordered by their heads of state in september to have the warrant in place by dec 31 , and the american official said , i think you 'll see by the end of december something that passes for a european arrest warrant , but you may have optouts as an example , he cited the refusal by britain and denmark to join the agreement by european countries to drop all border controls
bogota , colombia , nov 18 working under death threats , the prosecutors investigating the massacres and assassinations in colombia s civil war have never had it easy some have been killed or driven from the country , and because of a chronic shortage of money in the national attorney general s office , investigations have sometimes stalled but since 1995 , a specialized human rights unit within the office has sidestepped daunting obstacles to investigate the most horrific crimes , in some cases mass murders in which military officials were implicated in the process , the group of 28 prosecutors earned admirers , including members of the united states congress , the united nations and human rights watch , the rights monitoring group based in new york now , some of the unit s supporters have begun to criticize the new attorney general , luis camilo osorio , who they fear may stall investigations against rightwing paramilitary groups and rogue military officers they fear that mr osorio , a close ally of president andr s pastrana , was selected to mend relations between the president and an army bruised by recent investigations , not to carry out serious investigations to correct colombia s abysmal human rights record we think that maybe we will not be able to touch some people , said one prosecutor in the human rights unit , who spoke on the condition of anonymity my colleagues are going to think twice before they take on a case involving the military mr osorio , chosen by the supreme court in july for the fouryear posting , has said that the attorney general s office has focused so much on paramilitary groups and military officers that cases against leftist rebels have suffered a stand welcomed by many in the military establishment he forced out two highly respected prosecutors pedro diaz , who ran the human rights unit , and virgilio hernandez , the chief of the anticorruption unit after criticizing the arrest in july of a general , rito alejo del rio , accused of organizing paramilitary groups there is a new viewpoint , in terms of human rights investigations , said mr diaz , now in exile in the united states what is happening to those big investigations , involving military officials \? the way things are looking , the outlook is not good under mr osorio , some prosecutors investigating highprofile anticorruption cases have been transferred or cases have been nullified on procedural grounds the cases , while not directly tied to rights abuses , underscored the high level of official malfeasance that has helped fuel colombia s conflict a spokeswoman for mr osorio said the cases were found to have had serious legal problems , requiring further inquiries that does not mean they are being filed away , she said criticism of mr osorio has gained momentum since last month , when hina jilani , the special representative for human rights for the united nations secretary general , kofi annan , called into question mr osorio s independence mr osorio said he did not intend to slow investigations of paramilitary forces or state security officials but in an interview , he said the paramilitary groups did not commit a fourth part of the actions of the guerrillas saying cases involving human rights violations have had a privileged status , mr osorio said the human rights unit would instead simply step up its activities against the rebels for every 100 guerrilla actions there are fewer than 25 effective investigations , he said , while for 25 actions by the paramilitaries or the public security forces there are more than 100 investigations mr osorio said most colombians believed that the state must do more to attack the rebels , who themselves are responsible for massacres , widespread extortion and most of the 3 , 700 kidnappings last year we have to take investigations against guerrillas , which have been deficient , and elevate them , he said critics of mr osorio , though , have said he misses a central reality of colombia s conflict the paramilitary militias , financed by the cocaine trade and wealthy colombians as protection against the rebels , commit most of the killings in the country according to the ministry of defense , paramilitary forces killed at least 1 , 335 people from january 1999 to this past september , compared with 473 killings by the rebels that is exactly why we also have to investigate paramilitaries , since they cause violence and unrest , said pablo elias , who resigned as deputy attorney general to protest mr osorio s management and although theoretically in favor of the state , they are criminals former prosecutors said the role of the human rights unit since its founding in 1995 had been to investigate the most serious crimes mass murders and political assassinations , in some cases involving state security forces of 1 , 198 people formally investigated since the unit s founding , 634 were members of paramilitary groups and 234 were members of the public security forces the human rights unit has also opened formal investigations against 200 rebels , issuing arrest orders for top guerrilla commanders and other units within the attorney general s office have investigated other rebel crimes but former prosecutors and human rights officials say crimes by paramilitary groups , especially those in which state agents played a role , were a priority for the unit you cannot compare a guerrilla s actions with that of a member of the public force , who has authority and is given arms from the state , said mr hernandez , who ran the human rights unit from 1997 to 1999 of course , guerrillas should be investigated with the same rigor , but the general thesis is the state cannot gloss over human rights violations by its agents alejandro ramelli , the new chief of the human rights unit , said his prosecutors would now investigate everyone he noted that in his first three months on the job , 17 members of paramilitary groups and 2 members of the military had been formally charged along with 4 rebels but jose miguel vivanco , executive director of human rights watch s americas division , worries that cases involving paramilitary forces will be dropped in time if not for a lack of will then because of limited resources the unit operates on about 17 million a year , mr ramelli said meanwhile , human rights groups are worried that mr osorio s assertions that too much attention has been paid to paramilitary groups could further endanger those prosecutors who continue investigating those forces since 1995 , 6 prosecutors working on rights cases none from the human rights unit , but investigators of rights violations from regional offices have been slain , along with 22 investigators another 22 prosecutors and investigators have sought exile in other countries , according to human rights watch those who have fled under threat of death , like luis sarmiento , who was a regional prosecutor in the country s north , said that some of his colleagues might have died for nothing their work has not been valued or recognized , said mr sarmiento , now in florida this hurts very much because the people who do this work are very brave
7 million is n't hay just days before phillips auctions an 1891 example of monet s famous haystacks in new york , sotheby s has announced that another work from that series will be a highlight of its sales next month in london sotheby s painting , haystacks , last rays of the sun , has not been seen publicly since 1895 and has had only two owners one art expert said it was in a different league from the painting at phillips , which features a lone haystack against the setting sun phillips is auctioning that monet in its sale of impressionist and modern art on monday night it is expected to bring 7 million to 9 million haystacks , last rays of the sun \( 1890 \) is a far more ambitious composition , with two haystacks , a large one in the foreground in a crimson shade and a smaller one behind in greener tones a sharp shaft of light illuminates the ground between the two , casting a yellowish glow on the landscape the painting is estimated at 7 million to 98 million last rays is one of eight paintings still in private hands from this series , which captures different effects of the light and weather throughout the day monet , who worked on the paintings in 1890 and 1891 , sold this work directly to his friend the collector paul gallimard the year after it was painted gallimard was a regular at the art galleries of paris , especially durandruel , where the painting was exhibited in 1891 and 1895 , the last time it was seen in public until it went to sotheby s in london last week , it had never left france after gallimard s death in 1929 , his son , gaston , the founder of the french publishing empire gallimard , inherited the painting his family sold it in 1953 to l on constantin , a french collector , whose descendants are the current sellers it is thrilling that in europe you can still find such great , iconic paintings , said melanie clore , sotheby s director of impressionist and modern art worldwide she added that while the painting had been recorded in all of the literature about monet , including the catalogue raisonn of his work , it has never been reproduced in color until now last rays is on view at sotheby s york avenue galleries through may 13 along with the impressionist and modern paintings , drawings and sculptures being auctioned next week the whitney buys the whitney museum of american art has always collected cuttingedge work so it comes as no surprise that it has just bought nearly onefourth of the works by visual artists on view through june 10 in its bitstreams exhibition and we 're not done yet , said larry rinder , the museum s curator of contemporary art there are still some things from the show that are in the works many of the purchases are the artists' first works and in some cases the first works in certain mediums to enter the whitney s permanent collection the artists include jeremy blake , jim campbell , robert lazzarini , jon haddock and jason salavon the museum also bought a suite of 26 photographic collages representing the artist paul mccarthy s performances from the 1970 s and 80 s , a rare record of an important period in his career asked about future plans for computerized art , mr rinder said that the whitney would continue to collect it if the level of achievement continued to be high but not , he added , at the expense of other collecting areas minimal to the max the national gallery of art in washington is trying to strengthen its holdings in contemporary art , especially minimalism , an area in which officials admit their holdings are weak this week they announced the acquisition of two fluorescent sculptures by dan flavin and a word painting by edward ruscha last year the museum acquired four early works by the installation artist james turrell in the past we focused on european contemporary art by artists like polke , richter and kiefer , said earl a powell iii , the national gallery s director now we are trying to build our minimalist collection through its collectors committee , a 26yearold group of trustees and other supporters , the museum just received two flavins from the artist s 'monuments' for v tatlinseries flavin , who died in 1996 , worked on the series from 1964 to 1982 , producing about 40 sculptures that explore light and space the two works are to go on display soon the national gallery also received mr ruscha s lisp , a 1968 painting in which the word lisp is created out of graceful folds and twists of what appears to be a paper ribbon casting shadows against a yellow ground at the end of the ribbon text , tiny drops evoke the spray of a lisping speaker lisp will go on view in the museum s east building next week we have a 1983 ruscha , mr powell said but this is a much earlier , classic work taking a 'bath' sometimes it takes the j paul getty museum in los angeles a while to make up its mind this week it announced that it had bought an 1895 degas painting , after the bath , from alexander apsis , a former head of sotheby s impressionist and modern art department who is now a private dealer the late degas depicts a nude woman reclining on her right side in front of a bathtub , her left leg resting awkwardly on the edge of the tub and her left hand holding her left thigh in 1995 the painting was sold at sotheby s for 28 million , far below its estimate of 4 million to 6 million it went to an unidentified american collector who has turned around and sold it through mr apsis to the getty , where it has just gone on view in the 19thcentury paintings gallery we have been looking for a late degas for a while , said deborah gribbon , director of the museum it s a beautiful but challenging , daring composition it is also the first degas of its type in a los angelesarea museum while the norton simon museum in pasadena and the los angeles museum of art have their share of degas , none has a work from this period , ms gribbon said asked why the museum did n't buy this work at auction six years ago , she said , it had to do with what else we were focusing on at the time photo monet s haystacks , last rays of the sun , is to be offered at sotheby s in london \( sotheby s \)
back when we were grownups by anne tyler 274 pages alfred a knopf 25 anne tyler s lumpy new novel , back when we were grownups , has all the ingredients her readers have come to expect an eccentric baltimore family , a quirky protagonist suffering from a midlife crisis , a jerrybuilt plot that pivots around one character s sudden death and a supporting cast of oddballs fond of using quaint little expressions like oh , piffle and just dandy this fiction has always hovered perilously close to the line between heartfelt emotion and cloying sentimentality while novels like saint maybe and breathing lessons easily rose above the contrivance of their plots through the author s intimate knowledge of her characters' inner lives , others , like a patchwork planet , sunk distressingly into mawkishness in the case of grown ups , the novel weaves back and forth across that crucial line , veering dangerously into cuteness time and time again only to be rescued in the book s latter half by ms tyler s sure sense of family dynamics and domestic ritual the heroine of grownups is one rebecca davitch , a grandmother and smalltime martha stewart who presides with unrelenting jollity over a party and catering service called the open arms the service advertises itself as arranging celebrations for all of life s occasions from the cradle to the grave , and over the years , rebecca or beck , as her extended family calls her has become the consummate party giver , expert at concocting cute rhyming toasts for her guests and adept at orchestrating the ebb and flow of conversation she is the one in the davitch clan to take charge during a crisis and there are many crises , both small and large , in their chaotic household and she is the one to boost the spirits of family members when they are down one of her relatives tells her she ought to become a game show contestant she s got just that kind of enthusiasm and pep things were not always thus three decades ago , when rebecca impulsively married joe davitch , she was a polite , retiring woman , overwhelmed by her older husband s boisterous family joe , who first glimpsed rebecca at a party , believed mistakenly that she was a naturalborn celebrator and during their marriage rebecca did her best to live up to his expectations in the years since joe s death in a car accident , rebecca has assumed the role of family matriarch , ministering to her three stepdaughters and the daughter she had with joe as well as her doting brotherinlaw , her 99yearold greatuncle and assorted grandchildren and hangerson at the age of 53 , however , rebecca is suddenly overwhelmed by the sense that she is somehow living someone else s life like macon leary in the accidental tourist and ian bedlow in saint maybe , she finds herself in a midlife funk , torn between the imperatives of freedom and familial responsibility , independence and domesticity how on earth did i get like this \? she asks herself how \? how did i ever become this person who s not really me \? she wonders what her life might have been like had she not dropped out of college and impulsively married joe so many years ago she wonders where the road not taken might have led and so rebecca sets off on a search for her lost self she revisits her hometown , where her mother and aunt still live she begins a reading regimen as a form of selfimprovement and she looks up her high school and college sweetheart , will allenby , the man she summarily dumped for joe some 30 years ago though rebecca improbably manages to take up with will pretty much where they left off , ms tyler makes it clear to the reader that will is n't a terribly appealing suitor he s pretentious and peevish and uptight once a week he makes a batch of chili for himself and divides it into seven containers for each night of the week he answers the phone saying , dr allenby speaking , and he s got large , square wolfish teeth , unattractively yellowed with age given will s flaws , it s not hard to see where his romance with rebecca is headed for that matter , none of the characters in grownups is particularly sympathetic joe comes across as a big , pushy fellow with a dark streak of selfabsorption , and their daughter , min foo , as a petulant narcissist who discards her husbands as blithely as used hankies even rebecca often seems callous and selfserving though she knew will most of her life and dated him for years , she dumps him for joe without so much as a note or conversation she almost never says what s on her mind , masking her perpetual impatience with cheery platitudes , and she s spent the better part of her life trying to live up to her late husband s image of her as a bouncy enthusiast , despite her own reserved nature in most of her earlier novels , ms tyler would have used her generous gifts of compassion to limn the interior lives of rebecca and her family , to make their often curious behavior feel plausible , even sympathetic in grownups , however , she tends to stand back from her characters , allowing them to slip toward caricature what saves them from becoming cartoon figures , what in fact saves this novel from bathos , is ms tyler s ability to situate these incomplete people in a matrix of familial relationships that lend them emotional ballast and define their daily lives in showing how family traits are passed down generation to generation , in showing how shared rituals , celebrations and crises create a communal history , she demonstrates the talents that galvanized so many of her earlier books and that help redeem this very flawed novel photo anne tyler \( diana walker alfred a knopf \)
jerusalem , aug 21 relations between israel and the palestinians have so thoroughly deteriorated that any glimmer of diplomatic action , however faint , is seized as a possible path toward a truce that was the case here today with announcements that the palestinian leader , yasir arafat , and the israeli foreign minister , shimon peres , were prepared to meet soon to discuss how to put a declared but completely ignored ceasefire into effect no one on either side has suggested that the planned meeting , brokered by the german foreign minister , joschka fischer , necessarily qualifies as a breakthrough on the contrary , israeli and palestinian officials have expressed skepticism , with an adviser to prime minister ariel sharon saying , we do n't have exaggerated expectations even so , the stated willingness to at least sit down and talk was the first peaceful step that the two sides have taken after weeks of especially intense violence in the pummeling conflict that is now 11 months old as if to punctuate the difficulties that lie ahead for the negotiators , a small bomb exploded today beneath a car that was parked near israeli police offices in a district of central jerusalem known as the russian compound the area is also thick with restaurants and bars , which have become favorite targets for palestinian suicide bombers two weeks ago , only 300 yards away , one such bomber blew himself up in a crowded pizzeria , killing 15 people besides himself and wounding about 130 others no one was hurt in the explosion , on hirkanos street , aside from a woman who suffered slightly from shock but the police said a major disaster might have been avoided when officers opened the trunk of the parked car and found what they described as a much larger bomb , weighing 20 pounds or more mickey levy , the jerusalem police chief , said the smaller device might have been a decoy , intended to lure officers to the scene , only to have the big bomb go off and kill them the bomb squad spent hours trying to deactivate the material found in the car trunk , eventually detonating it in a controlled explosion while the police worked , a group calling itself the popular army front return battalion issued a statement in beirut saying it was responsible the continuing violence flared again in the early hours of wednesday , when four more palestinians were killed , reuters reported palestinian officials said they were shot dead by israeli soldiers in a gunfight between the two sides near the west bank city of nablus the army had no immediate comment israeli radio , citing military sources , said a squad of palestinians were ambushed by soldiers who believed they were laying a bomb no time or place was set for the arafatperes meeting given that both men will be traveling for the next few days , nothing seems likely to happen before next week berlin has loomed as a potential site , if only because the middleman in this latest attempt to stop the fighting is mr fischer , who has been here for the last two days , shuttling between the two sides mr arafat suggested berlin , but israeli officials said other locations were possible the german foreign minister has emerged as a pivotal figure in the hopes for peacemaking , in part because he helped bring about a lull in the violence after a palestinian suicide bomber killed 21 israelis at a tel aviv disco in early june his intervention led to an announced ceasefire arranged by george j tenet , the united states director of central intelligence but that truce exists in name only if anything , the level of mutual mistrust is higher than ever still , mr fischer has commanded the respect of both parties mr arafat clearly welcomes european involvement , for it brings closer the possibility of international intervention in the conflict , which he has sought for months and israeli officials acknowledged that they were not about to slight germany , viewed by many in the government as the country s best friend in europe from israel s perspective the immediate goal is to stop terrorism and other attacks it was not lost on some in the jewish state that germany , of all places , is the country now being asked to help put a stop to jews getting killed after meeting with mr arafat in ramallah , a west bank city just north of jerusalem , mr fischer noted that mechanisms for a truce already existed he was referring to recommendations made four months ago by an international commission led by former united states senator george j mitchell that panel proposed an immediate ceasefire that would lead to a meaningful coolingoff period , which in theory would create a climate for talks on the substantive issues the truce declared in june was supposed to be the first step in that process but it has led nowhere indeed , mr sharon has repeatedly said that nothing is going to happen until he first sees seven days of absolute quiet so far , it has been almost impossible to see seven hours pass without a shot being fired it is not clear if mr fischer had mr sharon s stand in mind , but he asserted today that what we need is the beginning of the implementation of the mitchell proposals not the invention of a new wheel , he added , but to make the existing wheels run his efforts to ease the crisis were endorsed by the united states secretary of state colin l powell was reported to have spoken to his german counterpart , and a state department spokesman , philip reeker , said in washington that the germans of course are trusted friends and close nato allies , and we welcome their constructive efforts with the parties virtually no one here expects the talks to be easy mr peres and mr arafat have met twice before , in late june and midjuly , without achieving true progress palestinian officials , including mr arafat s spokesman , nabil abu rudeineh , have spoken dismissively , even scornfully , of mr peres in recent days they questioned the use of talking with him , saying he lacked a mandate from mr sharon to make the political compromises that they insist are necessary for any deal for his part , mr sharon , who shares none of his foreign minister s dovish views , does not seem to hold out much hope for success zalman shoval , one of the prime minister s advisers , said we do n't have exaggerated expectations , not just because of arafat s record in the past , but also because his strategy is not to come to a peaceful settlement with israel he regards the present violence as part of his longterm strategy i would be very careful about being overly optimistic about a hopeful ending to this meeting obviously , what the two sides will talk about looms even larger than the where and when without elaboration , mr fischer said the discussions would be based on new ideas by the israelis that was an apparent reference to reports here that mr peres is recommending a ceasefire that would be put into effect in stages , starting in parts of the west bank and gaza strip where violence has not been great photos israeli bomb squad officers used a robot as they studied a car that exploded in downtown jerusalem

paris , june 4 the umpire was hunkered like a gargoyle above the court , refusing to overrule a questionable ace by franco squillari , triggering murmurs , boos and whistles inside center court today the reaction was a show of support for andre agassi as much as displeasure with the call the popular agassi was in trouble at the french open , already down by one set to none , in desperate need of this breakpoint opportunity agassi adores the french , but he did not need this kind of help when agassi begrudgingly positioned himself for the next point at deuce , the jeering went past the point of reason as the next rally unfolded , a highpitched whistle continued from the top deck , creating the irritating sound of air leaking out of a balloon agassi proceeded to plant a backhand wide instantly , he tilted his head toward the location of the noise , and yelled loud enough for everyone to hear come on , shut up after all , he could handle this with a few more games to size up squillari s roundhouse forehand , with the fitness to outlast his opponent s second wind , agassi scored another victory for 30somethings during his 46 , 62 , 64 , 16 , 60 victory to advance to the quarterfinals agassi was joined in the next round today by lleyton hewitt , s bastien grosjean , alex corretja and roger federer , all winners on a sundrenched day at roland garros it was warm enough for squillari to wilt once agassi summoned an energy reserve and dipped into his determination for the fifth set , the 25yearold argentine found himself mentally and physically tapped out it surprised me , squillari said i had been playing with the same ease , and i was relying on what i had done in the fourth set he had a lot more energy at this point , so it really took me by surprise it is really remarkable the way he continues to fight , as we all do , for so long the fifth set has become as much a part of agassi s strategy as his reflex service return and meticulous composition of points if agassi can push an opponent into a third hour , the 31yearold fitness junkie has endurance on his side all of the comfortfood sacrifices he has made to follow a stringent diet , all of the lungburning runs up the mountains near his las vegas home have left him fresh at the same moment muscle cramps creep into opponents' legs on the french open clay , where rallies last longer than a tootsie pop , agassi discovered the need for endurance in 1988 in a semifinal against mats wilander , agassi lost the match after dropping the fifth set by 60 that day i had four break points in the first game of the fifth set , said agassi , calling on his detailed memory i just spent everything i had i was dead i was starting to cramp i had no more energy left i knew 5foot11 , 145 pounds was n't going to win a slam it was that match that taught me i really needed to get stronger and make myself able to play for five sets the way i play the game , because it s physical today , squillari came out swinging his lethal forehand left agassi a little punch drunk at first whatever break points agassi had and there were seven in the first game of the match alone squillari would erase them with a forehand rip down the line agassi spent the first set trying to defuse squillari s power when it ended , squillari had 15 forehand winners agassi had one but as the match went along , agassi began mixing up his shots , moving squillari around and steering clear of the forehand danger zone but agassi did not need to conjure fancy winners to break squillari down , merely a consistent stroke for the match , squillari had 94 unforced errors to agassi s 52 squillari had 46 winners to agassi s 11 it was frustrating for squillari as strong as he was , agassi was able to absorb the power for a while , squillari appeared ready to give in to agassi s patience after he dropped the second and third sets i thought he was really tailing off , agassi said i felt like his best tennis was behind him at that point all of the sudden , almost like he just shifted gears in the fourth , he played incredible tennis it left me rather concerned toward the end of the fourth not panicked , though not physically frail , either agassi had plenty of tennis left in his body , plenty of might left in his mind he always feels that he s going to win , squillari said that s the impression that he gives , that he s never going to crumble when agassi was at his shakiest , the crowd was there to pick him up today , albeit to an extreme for one point on wednesday , agassi will test his fan base when he plays grosjean , the affable frenchman , in the quarterfinals i will understand the loyalty factor , agassi said it s going to be a hardfought match match points lleyton hewitt s reputation for

one after the next , a steady procession of buffed behemoths ambled onto the back porch of the eastern yacht club in marblehead , mass , the morning of sept 29 , and it was a little difficult to say what was scheduled to happen was it a sailing regatta , or a convention of outside linebackers \?

four years ago , reggio left the building business to pursue full time the esoteric occupation of running yacht races , a trade he has plied at regattas across the country and as far afield as auckland , new zealand , where he played a key role in the challenger s series during the last america s cup event i do n't make a lot of money but i'm perfectly comfortable with what i have , said reggio , who lives in essex , conn i do n't need a bmw or that other garbage as the yacht club s race committee boat , the emerson t oliver , pitched and rolled in miserable fashion out through the whitecapflecked harbor , it was clear that reggio enjoys what he does what a spectacular day ! he said happily and without a trace of irony , as at least one passenger thanked his stars he had skipped breakfast it was n't until the launch had dropped anchor well offshore in 130 feet of water that the sheer wildness of the morning was truly evident a good fourfoot seaway was running , with the occasional roller twice that size thrown in the cold northerly breeze was humming near 25 knots man , it s blowing the dogs off the chains , reggio said into this maelstrom , their rigs disappearing completely from sight in the troughs of the larger waves , sailed the 50odd fleet of suddenly vulnerablelooking finns wait until you see these guys screeching downwind , reggio said once the starting line was set and the course established , the race committee began the sequence of hoisting flags and sounding cannons to get the day s first race under way armed with radios , wind instruments , binoculars , a tape recorder and a handbearing compass , reggio took station on the committee boat s careening upper deck for the final countdown to the starting gun among the handful of boats that crossed the starting line early was the one sailed by the american olympic finn representative , russ silvestri none turned back to restart and exonerate themselves of the foul , an automatic disqualification for the race anyone who says that sailing is n't an athletic endeavor has never seen a finn sailor hiked out and working his boat upwind in significant breeze reggio appreciated their efforts these guys are sensational athletes , he said even so , the first race was a war of attrition several boats capsized and 10 competitors retired and turned back for the harbor silvestri was not one of them , and at the conclusion of the race he sailed past the committee boat and called out to reggio , asking if he had been over early to this he received an affirmative nod for silvestri , it was his second disqualification and effectively erased all hopes of victory his ensuing howl was long and loud it was also a prelude to the final race of the world championship series europeans dominate the class , and the leader coming into the day had been the european champion , emilios papathanasiou of greece but the final race belonged to the class s twotime champion , the polish sailor mateusz kusznierewicz , who wrapped up the week in dominating fashion with a wiretowire victory strong and powerful , he looked like a man among boys still , when the scores were tallied , by virtue of his string of consistent topthree finishes , the winner of the finn gold cup was a 30yearold belgian , s bastien godefroid for reggio , it was the conclusion of an exhausting if satisfying week on the ride back to the yacht club he said it was a good event , and i think the sailors thought so , too they 're the customers , as far as i'm concerned with that , he bounded from the boat to the dock , the day at the office complete photo peter reggio , at the finn gold cup last weekend , has been running yacht races for four years a nor'easter later made for rough sailing \( herb mccormick \)
moscow , june 18 president vladimir v putin said today that if the united states proceeded on its own to construct a missile defense shield over its territory and that of its allies , russia would eventually upgrade its strategic nuclear arsenal with multiple warheads reversing an achievement of arms control in recent decades to ensure that it would be able to overwhelm such a shield mr putin made his comments in a meeting with american correspondents that lasted nearly three hours tonight and was organized last week to give him an opportunity to explain his views after his summit meeting with president bush in slovenia on saturday the russian leader emphasized that though he is buoyed by mr bush s pledge that washington and moscow will work cooperatively in coming months to investigate the full ramifications of mr bush s vision for a new security framework that includes missile defenses , russia is also very alert to unilateral american actions and in response to comments made sunday in washington by mr bush s national security adviser , condoleezza rice , that the united states would proceed with missile defense with or without russia , mr putin said russia would not threaten or try to prevent american actions , but would augment its nuclear forces without regard to treaties that now require the elimination of multiple warheads when we hear statements that the programs would go with us or without us , well , we cannot force anyone to do the things we would like them to , he said we offer our cooperation we offer to work jointly if there is no need that such joint work is needed , well , suit yourself however , mr putin added , we stand ready to respond to any unilateral american action , even though russia does not see an immediate threat from a missile shield i am confident that at least for the coming 25 years american missile defenses will not cause any substantial damage to the national security of russia , he said but he added , we will reinforce our capability by mounting multiple warheads on our missiles and that will cost us a meager sum and so , he said , the nuclear arsenal of russia will be augmented multifold he said both the start i and start ii treaties would be negated by an american decision to build missile defenses in violation of the antiballistic missile treaty of 1972 such a step would eliminate verification and inspection requirements , he said , reviving an era in which russia would hide its abilities and intentions mr putin said russia was ready to move expeditiously on talks with mr bush s top aides , but he said he believed that the two sides first needed to discuss whether serious threats actually existed or might emerge in the future , then determine what missile defense technologies might be brought to bear against them , and then determine what provisions of the abm treaty came into conflict with such a system speaking in the kremlin library at the round conference table where he met president clinton last year , mr putin also stated for the first time that russia had taken an interest in ensuring that china s strategic concerns are addressed in the debate china has a much smaller nuclear missile force and fears that its national nuclear deterrent would be nullified by missile defenses one must be very careful here , he said the transparency of our action is very important , lest none of the nuclear powers would feel abandoned or that two countries are making agreements behind their backs asked if he had made a commitment to china , he replied , there is a commitment to preserve the balance of security that we have now in the world as a whole and in this sense , china is an important element , and not only china mr putin said the united states should bear in mind china s strong economic potential and its growing ability to respond to national security threats he said what concerned him most was that a unilateral american deployment of missile defenses could result in a hectic , uncontrolled arms race on the borders of our country and neighboring countries mr putin said he reported to the chinese president , jiang zemin , by telephone today the results of the meeting and mr bush s message about a cooperative approach to examining threats to international security mr jiang and mr putin met last week in shanghai with central asian leaders to form a security and trade cooperation pact speaking through an interpreter , mr putin joked that he had tried to speak some english with mr bush , but he said he feared that mr bush had only pretended to understand him he also spoke with pride about his record as a career kgb officer , pointing out that former secretary of state henry a kissinger had once told him that all decent people start out in intelligence , as mr kissinger did then mr putin added , referring to president bush s father , who served as director of central intelligence , the 41st president was not working in a laundry , he was working at the cia

washington , nov 27 faced with growing criticism over his refusal to identify people jailed since the sept 11 attacks , attorney general john ashcroft today provided for the first time the names of 93 people charged with crimes arising from the government s investigation mr ashcroft also released an accounting of the 548 people , most from middle eastern countries , who remain in custody across the united states on immigration charges that arose in the terror investigation but that list included only the nationalities and the charges not the names still , today s announcement was the justice department s most detailed disclosure about the people who have been arrested in the terror investigation , and it follows several days of harsh criticism by elected officials , civil libertarians and others of the government s tactics mr ashcroft spoke a day before the senate judiciary committee is to begin hearings into the government s lawenforcement efforts , including the detention of hundreds of people on immigration charges and the continuing interviews of 5 , 000 muslim men the committee s chairman , senator patrick j leahy , a vermont democrat , has been among the most persistent critics of mr ashcroft s tactics , and the attorney general s comments today seemed intended to deflect some of the criticism the bush administration is likely to face news analysis , page b7 mr ashcroft , who is expected to testify before the committee next week , insisted that rights have been protected while i am aware of various charges being made by organizations and individuals about the actions of the justice department , he said , i have yet to be informed of a single lawsuit filed against the government charging a violation of someone s civil rights as a result of this investigation of the 93 people named as criminal defendants , about 60 are in custody , a justice department list indicates the others have been released on bond or are being sought none have been charged with terrorism or involvement in the sept 11 attacks page b6 most of the charges are relatively minor , like credit card fraud or making false statements when applying for passports one man , souhail sarwer , is a fugitive wanted on charges of credit card fraud but mr ashcroft pointed to several who seemed to have links to the 19 men suspected of hijacking the four planes used in the sept 11 attacks one man , he noted , was charged with helping two of the suspected hijackers obtain fraudulent identification cards , while the names of two other men were found in a car left by another suspected hijacker at dulles international airport one of the men whose name was found in the car , osama awadallah , a 21yearold college student , was granted bail today in new york by a federal judge who questioned the strength of the government s case against him mr awadallah has been charged with lying before a grand jury when he denied knowing khalid almidhar , one of the men suspected of hijacking the plane that crashed into the pentagon , and prosecutors had sought to hold him without bail but the judge , shira a scheindlin of federal district court in manhattan , ruled that he could be released on 500 , 000 bond , saying , this defendant is charged with making false declarations not with terrorism , or aiding and abetting terrorism , or conspiring with terrorists the identities of many of the 93 people had already been released , including the 22 men charged in october with obtaining fraudulent licenses to drive commercial trucks loaded with hazardous materials most of those men were charged in pittsburgh , and remain in custody while providing the new numbers and details , mr ashcroft continued to withhold the identities of 548 people arrested for immigration violations he said he was required to release only the names of those charged with criminal violations , except for 11 people whose arrests have been sealed by a federal judge mr ashcroft said that some of the 600 in jail were members of al qaeda and that their arrest had probably foiled additional attacks he would not say how many or give their names , but law enforcement officials suggested they were mostly the 11 held under seal , mostly in new york mr ashcroft asserted that the law allowed him to withhold the names of those charged under the immigration code they were identified in a separate list only by their places of birth , the immigration violations they are charged with and the dates they were arrested of the 548 , the greatest number , 208 were from pakistan with the next largest group , 74 , from egypt mr ashcroft seemed irked with the complaints about the justice department s withholding details he said he was not releasing the names of those charged with immigration violations because that would aid osama bin laden by revealing which associates were in custody i am not interested in providing , when we are at war , a list to osama bin laden and the al qaeda network of the people we have detained that would make any easier their effort to kill americans , mr ashcroft said we might as well mail this list to the osama bin laden al qaeda network as to release it the al qaeda network may be able to get information about which terrorists we have in our custody , but they 'll have to get it on their own on monday , he had said he would not release the names of those arrested because it would violate their privacy rights and would damage their reputations by putting them on a kind of blacklist mr ashcroft s actions today did not appear to silence some critics senator russell d feingold , a wisconsin democrat and member of the judiciary committee , said , while i appreciate the justice departments finally providing a rough estimate of the number people who are currently in detention , i continue to be deeply troubled by its refusal to provide a full accounting of everyone who has been detained and why mr feingold said the administration s stand on releasing information on the detainees was part of a larger problem involving plans for military tribunals and authorizing eavesdropping on conversations between some lawyers and terrorist suspects mr ashcroft today sought to portray the administration s actions as well aimed at what he said was the government s greatest priority , preventing future terrorist actions we are standing firm in our commitment to protect american lives , he said the department of justice is waging a deliberate campaign of arrest and detention to protect american lives , and we 're removing suspected terrorists who violate the law from our streets to prevent further terrorist attack we believe we have al qaeda membership in custody , and we will use every constitutional tool to keep suspected terrorists locked up he said all of those detained had access to a lawyer and were able to contact their families ten to 15 defendants are being held as material witnesses , with most in a federal detention center in new york among them is zacarias moussaoui , a 33yearold french citizen of moroccan descent who was arrested in minnesota on aug 17 senior bush administration officials are debating whether to make mr moussaoui the first person to be tried on terrorism charges before a military tribunal the group also includes nabil almarabh , a former boston cabdriver whom an informer linked to mr bin laden , and ayub ali khan and mohammed azmath , who were carrying box cutters and at least 5 , 000 in cash when they were arrested aboard a train in texas on sept 11 photo

kunduz , afghanistan , nov 26 the bodies of the taliban soldiers lay stiff and straight at odd points across the intersection of khanabad road and chugha street the big toes on their bare feet were tied together , an islamic burial custom , and their white turbans were unfurled to reveal bullet holes through the tops of their heads they did n't have a car , said muhammad ashraf , 25 , standing over the body of a taliban soldier whose name nobody knew they could n't get away , like the rest of them when the northern alliance soldiers came , they killed them none of the people who milled around the remains of one of the last skirmishes for the city of kunduz could recall exactly how the eight taliban soldiers had met their deaths , or how , for at least two of the men , the bullets came to be fired so neatly into their heads there was a fight , the men were dead and by late afternoon the bodies were gone a liberation of sorts came to kunduz today the last big garrison of taliban soldiers in northern afghanistan pulled up its stakes and fled , hundreds of them , some disappearing into the steppe that sweeps out of the city , some surrendering to the army that waited for them as they tried to run away behind them they left a number of mysteries , among them the fate of many foreign taliban fighters and the nature of several flights into the kunduz airport during the siege villagers said today that they had heard airplanes take off and land in the two weeks before the city fell some villagers reported seeing taliban troops regularly heading into the airport before the planes landed and disappearing after they left one of the taliban fighters left behind was abdul hadid , who appeared to be near death as he sat on the asphalt edge of the town s square mr hadid , a taliban soldier , was shot through his left ribs at the city s fruit market just before nightfall he was barefoot and bleeding thirty northern alliance soldiers stood over him where are you from \? one of the soldiers shouted where are your friends \? where is your gun \? mr hadid s dark robe was soaked with urine he was trembling thin and fullbearded , he looked plaintively at two western journalists who stood in the crowd i have a friend in germany , he said , as if pleading for help a northern alliance commander led him off in a horsedrawn cart he said he was taking him to the hospital foreign taliban fighters , the subject of so much speculation , were nowhere to be seen , vanished like the stories of their fanatical preparations for a last stand many of them appear to have surrendered northern alliance officials said about 800 taliban soldiers , many of them pakistanis and arabs , had turned themselves over in the village of chardara , west of kunduz the northern alliance said some of the fleeing taliban had set up defensive positions at chardara , but by midafternoon the village was empty everybody is surrendering , said one of the prisoners who was being led away it is finished no one has the strength anymore to fight maybe some of the foreigners got out another way on the outskirts of kunduz , villagers in the hamlet of angurbagh gave weight to the persistent rumors that planes , perhaps pakistani , had swooped in to rescue trapped pakistani militants before the arrival of the northern alliance the village sits across the road from the kunduz airport , where no regular commercial flight has landed or taken off in more than a year an airplane landed every night for the past 12 days , said gul muhammad , 35 , a shop owner another local merchant , salahuddin , 24 , added every day the taliban soldiers came in trucks and went into the airport the planes left , and the troops went with them the villagers said they had not seen the planes , only heard them they also said that american jets had bombed the airport repeatedly , and that taliban crews came out almost every day to fix the runway that assertion , if true , suggests that if pakistani airplanes indeed landed here , they did so without any tacit agreement from the united states at angurbagh so many bombs fell on the airport that the shock waves shattered the windows of almost all of the villagers wealthy enough to have them the villagers at angurbagh also seemed to confirm another assertion of northern alliance officials that airplanes landed as late as sunday , and that one plane tried to land on sunday night and veered off when the pilot apparently realized that the airport was no longer in the hands of the taliban one plane tried to land last night and could not , mr salahuddin said the people of kunduz celebrated their change of government in an uneven way , relishing the departure of their oppressive overlords and watching nervously as their new ones , armed and confident , spread out across town the lighthearted mood that flowered in so many of the cities that had thrown off the taliban yoke seemed mostly absent here , and the relief at the taliban s departure was muted well , the taliban are finally gone , said zulgai zabihullah , 21 , a medical student who went to class today without his mandatory turban for the first time since the taliban took control of the city four years ago maybe i wo n't celebrate today maybe tomorrow maybe tomorrow , when the shops are open again kunduz , the last big taliban redoubt besides kandahar , held on for two weeks against the northern alliance forces that squeezed the taliban on all sides
jets general manager terry bradway has ordered the same bologna sandwich each monday and tuesday since the jets started winning six weeks ago and wore the same sport coat to four consecutive games no reason to mess with karma when the jets were on such a roll , even if his cardiologist and the fashion police might say otherwise but after sunday s debacle , bradway should consider a switch to tuna no , not that tuna and take the jacket \( a nice tannish houndstooth \) to a consignment shop better he dons a red number with white fur trim as much as the jets try to ignore it , this is the season for another nailbiting december so many lumps of coal have been placed in jets stockings in years past that they threaten to topple the mantle entirely with five games remaining three of them on the road against pittsburgh , indianapolis and oakland the jets will have to crank up the christmas carols to drown out all the murmurs about their impending demise on monday , linebacker mo lewis , who has been with the jets for almost a decade and has seen the full scope of december disaster , stood in the middle of the locker room and insisted that this year would be different , although , when pressed , he admitted that he could n't quite put his finger on why it would be different we look at every game now as a playoff , safety victor green said we look for bigger things we 're not just looking for the wild card we 're looking for the division and the bye week actually , that was green exactly one year ago , after the jets beat the colts to go to 94 on the season they were two games ahead of buffalo and indianapolis and one behind the dolphins the jets did n't see the threegame collapse coming then and , no matter what they say , they ca n't forecast what will happen now this year , the jets are a full game behind the dolphins but in a slightly more precarious spot than last year the surging patriots , who play cleveland at home sunday , are just a halfgame behind the jets and the jets , like last year , have a difficult road game awaiting them last year , it was oakland that was the beginning of the end this year , pittsburgh , the best team in the afc , with the best defense in the league , has the chance to do serious damage to the jets' playoff hopes does what happened last year mean anything this year \? of course not then again , the jets embrace the idea that they are in the dolphins' heads , so why ca n't the same be said of an entire month \? after the loss to the patriots , coach herman edwards did his best to squash any potential talk about a december hex by confronting it headon , a vastly different approach than most coaches would have taken he told players that they could follow the terrible history of the jets in december or they could make their own history and then he mocked numbers that reporters come up with to underline the jets' brutal december history \( hint the jets are 1430 in december since 1990 \) one thing i know about this franchise , if you go back far enough in history , you can bring up a lot of ghosts , because they did n't win a lot , edwards said you can get your big mountain here it will be mount everest we 're not going to do that i do n't want the players to get into that this is our team right now it s all we can control you want to go four years back \? one year back \? you want to take it back to joe willie \? that s history it does n't have to do with what we 're going to do now jets players say they had not even thought about december until edwards brought it up , but none of them forget what happened last year a few key comparisons the jets' offense was scoring much more consistently last season , despite vinny testaverde s 25 interceptions last year , the offense scored 34 touchdowns in 16 games this year , it has scored 21 touchdowns in 11 games the offense last year ranked 12th in the league this year , it is ranked 26th the offense is averaging just 285 yards per game last year , it averaged 52 more yards does any of that matter right now \? no more so than rich kotite s record in december \( you do n't want to know \) unless you 're a longsuffering jets fan used to having the holidays go from green to black in a hurry i do n't think anyone here pays attention , curtis martin said we 've just got to get that out of our heads hopefully , this is the last year you 'll bring it up extra points in the wake of aaron glenn s knee injury , which is expected to keep him out up to a month , the jets signed the rookie cornerback james rooths off green bay s practice squad yesterday rooths originally signed with the jets april 28 and was released sept 1 to make room for rooths , the jets waived offensive tackle cornell green photo herman edwards says he is not interested in bringing up ghosts from the past \( vincent laforet the new york times \)
paris just because peugeot sat out the round of automotive mergers and acquisitions in recent years , do n't count it out its web of alliances and its twopronged brand approach illustrate the fiercely independent strategy of its chairman and chief executive , jeanmartin folz and the strategy appears to be working size is not the key factor , mr folz said recently , picking at a lunch of lamb at the headquarters of psa peugeot citro n , steps from the arc de triomphe who are the most profitable \? he asked , then answered his own question bmw , porsche , us mr folz has forged links with other automakers on specific projects and rejuvenated the citro n brand , enabling the company to pursue the multibrand strategy that has worked magic for volkswagen more recently this approach has also been embraced by renault , peugeot s big rival across town , which has acquired controlling stakes in nissan of japan , dacia of romania and samsung of south korea peugeot s success has been remarkable in recent years , it elbowed its way past giants like ford motor and the opel division of general motors to capture the secondlargest share of the european market , behind volkswagen and there is no sign of it weakening in the first five months of the year , while sales of new cars in europe slumped by 33 percent , to 67 million , peugeot raised its european sales by almost 5 percent , to 927 , 160 cars it widened its european market share to 138 percent , from 127 percent a year ago volkswagen has 19 percent at peugeot , net income last year was 29 percent of revenue , compared with 28 percent at bmw , and 57 percent at porsche at vw , it was 23 percent , and at renault , 26 ford , opel and fiat lost money in europe for mr folz , 54 , success in the auto business was not a given he climbed the corporate ladder with the chemical company rh nepoulenc the big aluminum company pechiney , and finally the sugar and food products company eridania beghinsay before joining peugeot in 1995 the lesson he drew , he said , was that a fundamental error often brought to the making and selling of cars is the logic of commodities no one thinks about what sells cars , mr folz added brands , style , passion sell cars and price is not the key factor , either in europe , he said , the way to sell cars is to be first off the blocks with as many models as possible yet peugeot s relatively small size in the world market the company has annual production of roughly three million cars renders it somewhat fragile , he acknowledged to overcome that fragility , peugeot has woven alliances to develop and manufacture components and whole cars jointly this began three decades ago , he said , with renault , with which peugeot develops and makes motors and transmissions in the 1980 s , it teamed up with fiat , the italian automaker , with which it designs and builds minivans and light commercial vehicles earlier this year , ford was added to the roster , in an alliance to develop and build diesel engines and on friday mr folz unveiled a similar agreement , this time with toyota , to jointly develop and build in europe a fuelefficient subcompact the ford deal illustrates the value of alliances last year , 37 percent of cars sold in europe had diesel engines , yet at peugeot , which sniffed the trend early on , it was almost 50 percent ford , oriented toward american drivers who have little interest in diesel , had missed the trend to catch up , ford negotiated the joint venture with peugeot , which was interested in developing advanced diesels that run quietly yet produce more power with the same amount of fuel by sharing the 400 million investment with ford , peugeot cut development costs in half alone , we could not have justified the expense , mr folz said of course , not all the credit goes to mr folz karl ludvigsen , an industry consultant in london , said mr folz s predecessor , jacques calvet , pretty much established this style of strategy , though , he added , it has matured under folz where mr folz pushed further , he said , was in reviving the citro n brand for years , citro n was a kind of stepchild to revive its distinct identity , mr folz offered new models , like the xsara picasso , a popular minivan , and the c5 , a sedan in the tradition of citro n s comfortable big cars paradoxically , the revival of citro n s identity went hand in hand with its disappearance as a separate manufacturer to cut costs and bolster price competitiveness , mr folz unified most backoffice operations , including research , model development and purchasing peugeots and citro ns are now built in the same factories indeed , many share platforms , or underbodies by 2004 , all peugeots and citro ns will be built on only four shared platforms , while 60 percent of the components that the customer does not see , like axles , brake systems and airconditioning units , will be common to both brands the results have been impressive in addition to capturing more market share , peugeot has excelled financially last year , pretax income reached 22 billion euros , or 19 billion , versus 11 billion euros in 1999 revenue rose almost 17 percent last year , to 441 billion euros peugeot invested three billion euros last year to upgrade factories and develop new models , and spent 813 million euros on share buybacks peugeot s stock traded recently at about 3207 euros , up from 240 euros at the start of the year that is more than 10 times pershare earnings , while volkswagen s stock has stagnated with a ratio just over 5 mr folz is also expanding overseas the main targets are south america , where peugeot last year opened a 700 million factory in brazil and refurbished an older plant in argentina eastern europe , which peugeot supplies from factories in western europe and china , where it sold 54 , 000 cars last year but the united states market , which peugeot abandoned a decade ago , is not in his sights yet although it is the world s biggest auto market , one already dotted with peugeot fan clubs , mr folz has no immediate plans to try again still , not everyone is convinced that peugeot can pursue indefinitely a policy of splendid isolation and selective alliances they are at the sweet point of their product cycle , said zee tull , an analyst at merrill lynch , adding that peugeot has stayed strong because of its heavy reliance on a few western european markets , mainly france , spain and britain , where car sales have held up so far this year the brunt of the downturn , she said , has

this year s roster of best books contains five works of fiction and four of nonfiction , compared with last year s five of each choosing was easy nominating was not throughout the year there is some competition among editors to put books on the list for consideration yet from 1997 through last year , the numbers nominated declined by two each year this year the process nasdaqed , ending in only 16 nominations , down from 20 last year there are four novels on the 2001 list , a collection of stories , two memoirs , an intellectual history and a biography of the fiction writers two are american , one canadian , one australian and one german all the nonfiction is by americans , although one of the writers did not start out that way two of the writers , one in each category , have appeared on these lists in the past , and only one , a novelist , is under 35 the volume of history is in part a collection of biographies , and the biography is in part a broadside against received history as for the memoirs , which both focus on childhood , it is hard to imagine two accomplished writers having grown up in more contrasting conditions characterization of the fiction is best done in the accounts given below but since we like to signal firsts in any year , there is one odd circumstance to notice one of the novels , as everyone knows , gained a certain notoriety when oprah winfrey chose it for her book club and the author allowed he was not entirely pleased by this honor , even though her nod would virtually guarantee its reaching the top of the bestseller list it so happens that our reviewer of the book conjured up almost this very scenario in his review more than a month before the brouhaha erupted there is no precedent for this editors here like to feel we have an effect in the literary world , but it had never occurred to any of us that a reviewer might slip a script of the future into a passing clause the best books were chosen from among those reviewed by us since the 2000 holiday books issue , and the summaries below draw on those reviews best books are not included among the notable books of the year , which begin on page 63 austerlitz by w g sebald random house memory is moral treachery in the works of w g sebald , and in none is it more threatening than in this one his protagonist , dafydd elias , grew up in wales and is past 50 before he finds he is really jacques austerlitz , whose jewish parents sent him from central europe to britain at 4 to escape the holocaust , in which they perished that would suggest he is like leading characters in several other sebald novels , for whom missing the holocaust left holes in their lives but this man s name signals that sebald is on a much more farreaching quest this time napoleon s brilliant victory over russia and austria at the czech town of austerlitz in 1805 was taken by poets at the time and many historians later as a sign that a european political and social order dating from charlemagne was gone , and that the pursuit of transcontinental imperial power had taken a new form in this novel austerlitz , the character , is an architectural historian whose meditations on the past dwell on monstrous buildings and fortifications , some of them instrumental in the fate of his parents , as if the natural end of empire was terezin or auschwitz as so often in sebald s fiction , direct connections are never highlighted in the vast loops and sudden knottings of his rhetoric , but the reader cannot escape the inference that in the long sweep of history the nazis were not alone , but that an inquirer searching for meaning is borrowed finery a memoir by paula fox henry holt company paula fox s children s books have been staples for 35 years , and her adult fiction has had a rousing revival recently but nothing she has done has prepared her readers for this fragmentary memoir it may send many back to her other books , for it turns out she has been fictionalizing her real life all along , beginning with the remark of a character in one novel i was born and thrown away it was her mother who decreed she had to go , not long after she was born , and she was passed along among relatives and friends haphazardly all over the country and in cuba almost until she was an adult occasionally the feckless parents would remember she was theirs and intrude on her childhood disastrously her father sometimes tried to be kind , but recollections of these few moments are among the most painful parts of this book so little so seldom as for the mother , there is no pretense that fox , now 78 , has ever penetrated that dark natural force indeed , it is her inability to come to an understanding that makes borrowed finery so haunting it is organized among the many locales of her youth and has a choppy , imagistic quality that reflects the reality of that time throughout there are glimpses of what saved her spirit and made her a writer the sharp , funny observations of people s conduct and character by a girl of quick intelligence who had to learn too early the saving value of guarded independence the corrections by jonathan franzen farrar , straus giroux
for about a decade , the state and city of new york looked for a site in downtown brooklyn for the new kings county family court , the new york state supreme court and related city agencies they finally found it at 330 jay street , across the street from metrotech center , the 10block complex of commercial , educational and hightechnology offices in an unusual arrangement , those courts and a dozen of the agencies will occupy 25 floors in the 30story building that is under way at the southwest corner of jay street and tech place , while the top five floors will be leased to commercial office tenants we do n't know who those tenants will be , because it s still almost four years before any occupants move in , said bruce ratner , the president and chief executive of forest city ratner , which is developing the 600 million building but when we start marketing that space in about two years , there s a good chance we can get law firms from brooklyn and parts of manhattan firms that do litigation in brooklyn other possibilities , mr ratner said , include brooklyn financial institutions while it is still too early to set an asking price for the commercial office space , mr ratner said it would probably range from 38 to 40 per square foot annually groundbreaking for the 11millionsquarefoot building took place two months ago , and completion is scheduled for the spring of 2005 at that time , the building is expected to also be known as 12 metrotech center and to become part of the metrotech business improvement district in downtown brooklyn it will also be part of the new york city s 25 billion master plan to modernize its courts part of this plan includes the building s 600 million design and construction cost financed by general obligation bonds issued by the city richard karson , an executive director of insignia esg , a real estate services company , who runs its new york city offices outside manhattan and those in long island , said that the likely asking price sounded reasonable there s not a lot of firstclass office space in downtown brooklyn , he said , and the cost of constructing new buildings is expensive forest city ratner has built several major projects in downtown brooklyn they include the 138 million , 19story office building at 1 pierrepont plaza , which was the first new office building in downtown brooklyn in 25 years when it opened in 1988 , as well as atlantic center , the fiveyearold 400 , 000squarefoot retail center but none of its other projects has had anywhere near the ratio of government space to commercial space that 330 jay street will have we 're basically a brooklyn developer , mr ratner said , and we always felt that the demand for brooklyn office market space has been strong at least we never had much of a vacancy rate a big reason for that , he added , is that forest city ratner it builds primarily to suit , meaning that it acquires an anchor tenant before building some space for speculation at pierrepont plaza , the anchor tenant is morgan stanley , while at 330 jay street it is the new york city court system but until six or seven years ago , mr ratner said , forest city ratner could not decide whether the building would be leased mostly to private sector tenants or to the various city agencies , many of which were , like the courts , overcrowded and rundown designed by the manhattan architectural firm of perkins eastman , the new building will have three separate lobbies , one each for the family court , the supreme court and the commercial tenants among the city agencies that will occupy 25 of the building s floors are the brooklyn district attorney s office , the department of correction , the department of probation , legal aid , the new york police department and the department of mental health , mental retardation and alcoholism services although the ratio of government offices to commercial offices in the new building is unusually high , that is not expected to dampen the enthusiasm of commercial tenants , for several reasons the separate lobbies are designed to take the unusual mixture of tenants into account , mr karson said , and the fact that the most expensive spaces on the top of the building will be for the commercial tenants gives it a 'building within a building' concept , and that means that it s likely to work with a major investment in money and time , forest city ratner also believes that it will work but , mr ratner cautioned , developing a building is a little like producing a play on broadway , because you can never be sure if you have a hit until opening night photo a highrise in downtown brooklyn will house offices and courtrooms \( perkins eastman architects \)
washington every once in a while a successful product , having fallen on hard times , comes back to the market in modest form , more or less as an experiment , to see if the old customer loyalty can be revived this happened with life magazine and ipana toothpaste it is happening now with the democratic majority in the senate we are being asked to try out a 2001 limited edition of democratic legislative power for most of the past halfcentury , democrats were dominant they controlled the house for 40 years , starting in 1955 , and the senate for but six of those years during much of that time they held roughly threefifths of all the state legislative seats in the country more recently , however , their product has n't sold so well now , thanks to the entrepreneurship of senator james jeffords , the product is on conspicuous display again at the senate location how will it sell \? to answer that question , it s important to understand why the old version did so well in the first place it s important , most of all , to understand what the product was the commodity that the democratic party sold successfully , until the debacle of 1994 , was n't an ideology or a platform it was a collection of candidates who held on to power through a full quartercentury even as their ideas were viewed with suspicion by a majority of the electorate and their standardbearers were at a distinct disadvantage in the more visible universe of presidential campaigns presidential politics is unlike the rest of politics outside the presidential fishbowl , talent and enterprise mean far more than public opinion or ideology the results depend on thousands of individual candidates who must want the jobs badly enough to fight for them this is the way democrats won , year in and year out by producing a generation of candidates who could outtalk , outthink and outwork their republican opposition it was the generation of bill clinton , of al gore , of tom daschle , and of officeholders at all levels of government who fit their profile born in the early babyboom years educated in the 1960 s and early 1970 s introduced to politics at the height of national ferment over vietnam , civil rights and the environment consistently liberal on all these issues , they were also skillful and industrious enough to win whether the voters agreed with them or not this may not be america s greatest generation of statesmen , but in terms of sheer political skill , we have rarely seen its equal take , for instance , mr daschle of south dakota , the new senate majority leader he graduated from college in 1969 , spent three years in the air force and returned home disillusioned with the vietnam war he worked for an antiwar senator , returned home to plan his own congressional campaign , rang 40 , 000 doorbells and took the general election by 139 votes once in office , he was tireless and unbeatable politics was his career and his life everyone who challenged him looked like an amateur republicans , meanwhile , in a party suspicious of government , had difficulty attracting their brightest young people to public careers that shut out private employment for years at a time the republican party produced a certain amount of careerist talent in this generation there was , after all , newt gingrich but not enough to compete for power effectively on all the fronts that the system required republicans had moments when the talent turned out as in 1980 , when young conservatives all over the country were struck by reagan taxcut enthusiasm but the moments did n't last many of these candidates were back in private life within a few years , usually by their own preference they tended to view running for office as a necessary evil , not a lifetime occupation then came 1994 , and the familiar democratic world came apart democrats lost congress they lost 10 governorships they lost control of legislative chambers all over the country millions of words have been written about the 1994 election and its consequences , and yet none of the standard explanations the clinton health care fiasco , the congressional bank scandals , the revolt of the angry white male is entirely convincing there is , however , another explanation for what happened the democratic party s superiority in talent , energy and commitment finally gave out the liberal baby boom cohort was no longer entering politics , and the generation taking its place lacked any of the critical enthusiasm or motivation there was no vietnam , no civil rights movement , no perceived environmental crisis there was no longer much sense of possibility about government in general little conviction that government could be the instrument for solving the hardest social and economic problems of the time and so , given a push from some shortterm public issues and frustrations , the whole edifice collapsed the republicans did n't exactly seize power in 1994 , even though it may have looked that way the democrats relinquished it it was n't so much that young conservatives had suddenly developed a craving for politics it was that liberals had lost theirs this theory , if right , suggests what the democratic party needs to do as it gets another , albeit limited , opportunity persuade bright young people that there are issues worthy of the sacrifices a political career entails easier said than done there are no vietnams or civil rights dramas to attract youthful enthusiasm but there are other things the rise of the global economy and the growing dominance of impersonal market forces over everyday life from health care to telecommunications are creating new issues everywhere in the political system dealing with these issues will be a messy job , but somebody will have to do it in fact , thousands of people the struggle to attract them is the one democrats must win to reclaim their role as the party of government in the 21st century drawing \( michael bierut \)
before last night s game , lou piniella expressed some concern about his team s recent ability to score runs it seemed to be a questionable concern considering that the seattle mariners had scored more runs than any of the other 29 major league teams and in the past two weeks had scored five or more runs nine times in 12 games for some teams , the mets , for example , that output might be a month s worth of runs but then the mariners took the field at yankee stadium and made their manager s plaint look like a selffulfilling prophesy bringing their major leaguebest record to the home of the team that only three years ago broke the american league record for victories in a season , the mariners went down meekly , 40 , in the opener of a threegame series some have touted as a preview of the al championship series it may very well be that the yankees and the mariners will meet for the pennant and an allexpenses paid trip to the world series , but it would be a stretch to say that the outcome of these three games will provide a glimpse of the october series again the mets come to mind in 1988 they thrashed the los angeles dodgers during the season , winning 10 of the 11 games between the eventual division champions but somehow , when the world series began that october , it was the dodgers and not the mets who played the oakland athletics on the other hand , teams in this circumstance can send messages to each other that could reverberate in a postseason series the yankees' messenger boys were busy last night jorge posada , the yankees' catcher , sent two messages himself in the first four innings the last time these teams met , three months ago , or half a season , the mariners stole everything but posada s favorite picture of 20monthold jorge jr they stole successfully eight times in nine tries , with ichiro suzuki getting two stolen bases in one game and mark mclemore three in two games posada was unable to stop the steals because he had developed tendinitis in his shoulder in spring training and the pain was getting worse , not better last night , posada threw out mclemore at second base for the third out in the first inning and nailed suzuki in the fourth when he tried to steal second as mclemore struck out posada might as well have hung a sign on top of his chest protector saying , hey guys , my shoulder is better , thank you the mariners , on the other hand , suspected a hometeam plot they 're starting to wet these fields down pretty good on us , said piniella , whose base runners trail the leagueleading yankees by two stolen bases but have a better success ratio that was the case tonight and in boston i guess , he added facetiously , there has n't been much rain here john moses , the mariners' first base coach , said the infield was pretty damp the first three or four innings , but added candidly , ichiro would have been out anyway posada made a good throw bret boone was the recipient of a more personal message boone is the mariners' second baseman who inexplicably has burst out with a career year in which he is a very close third in the league in runs batted in , second in hits and fourth in batting average , total bases and runs scored mike mussina , however , would have none of it twice in three innings he sent messages to boone that were highly effective the old western union could n't have done it as explicitly with runners at first and second in the fourth inning following the mclemoresuzuki double play , boone swung and missed on a 32 pitch that was high and out of even the rulebook strike zone that the umpires are supposed to be calling this season yeah , he did swing at ball four , piniella said , but he s an aggressive hitter he s going to do that from time to time when boone batted next , in the sixth inning , the mariners again had runners at first and second with two out , and again mussina went to a 32 count this time he threw a pitch down but in the strike zone and boone grounded it right back to him for the third out asked if it was unusual for boone not to come through in at least one of those situations , piniella said , he s done it pretty consistently all year , but nobody can do it consistently mussina , who has given the yankees a splitpersonality type of pitching performance for their 885 million , presented the good mussina last night not that he was sending his own message , because the next time he pitches against the mariners , if there is a next time this year , he could trot out the evil mike but shutting out the highestscoring team in the majors , which had been shut out only once this season , for seven innings is an admirable effort , even if piniella had foreshadowed it with his pregame lament the yankees , however , gave the mariners one more message to digest this one was loud , delivered by derek jeter in the first inning , shane spencer in the second and alfonso soriano in the fourth they each hit home runs , producing all four runs and displaying a power surge greater than the onehomeragame average the yankees had produced in the teams' first six games by the time this game ended , the mariners' message box was full before the game , piniella said he would be happy if the mariners left new york with two victories they would like to leave some messages of their own along with winning those games photo ichiro suzuki , one of two runners catcher jorge posada threw out trying to steal , was tagged out by derek jeter in the fourth inning \( bernie nunez for the new york times \)
freehold , nj , dec 3 a new jersey judge sent four schoolteachers to jail today for disobeying a returntowork order , the first time in more than two decades that striking teachers in the state have been incarcerated judge clarkson s fisher jr of state superior court ordered the four to remain in the monmouth county jail for at least one week , unless they decide before then to return to their classrooms in the sprawling central new jersey suburb of middletown township the sentences were imposed at an emotional hearing marked by the muffled sobbing of some teachers and the occasional babbling of infants judge fisher said he was imposing the jail terms reluctantly but he added that he had no other way to compel middletown s 1 , 000 striking teachers and secretaries to comply with the order he issued on thursday , the first day of the walkout the four teachers two men and two women became the first striking teachers ordered to jail in the state since several were incarcerated in camden for 26 days during a strike in 1978 , according to the new jersey education association , the statewide teachers' union after sheriff s deputies took the four from judge fisher s courtroom about 6 pm , hundreds of their colleagues held a noisy rally outside monmouth county s hall of records and cheered their union president s appeals for support and solidarity none of us can break faith with our four martyrs , the president of the middletown teachers' union , diane swaim , shouted from the building s front steps none of us can afford to go to work tomorrow or the next day , or the next day we are determined to see this through to the end if it means every one of us goes to jail , so be it each of ms swaim s comments drew loud applause from union members and appeared to deepen the already troubled relationship between the striking union and the middletown board of education three years ago , ms swaim led a oneweek strike against the school district the current walkout at the town s 17 schools , which serve about 10 , 500 children , began thursday , only hours after contract negotiations resumed after a moratorium of two and a half months that followed the sept 11 terror attacks about three dozen of middletown s 61 , 000 residents were killed in the attack many more teachers are likely to be sent to the county jail tuesday morning , when judge fisher continues the hearing that started about 5 pm today judge fisher began calling striking union members before him one by one , in alphabetical order he managed to deal with only those whose last names began with a , or about 18 of the 1 , 000 people on strike those whose names start with b will be called first on tuesday the judge and the school board s lawyer , douglas j kovats , asked each teacher called before the judge s bench if they had been served with the thursday order and if they planned to comply with it in the future the first two called were robert abbot , a physical education teacher , and his wife , susan , a teacher for children with learning disabilities judge fisher excused her because , he said , he wanted to allow her to remain at home with the couple s child mr abbot readily acknowledged violating the backtowork order he said he would continue to do so because under the board s current contract offer , i will be in a negative financial spiral for the remaining years i have in the district judge fisher ruled that mr abbot did not have a sufficient legal reason to ignore the order and imposed a oneweek sentence he then sent mr abbot to the courtroom jury box afterward , outside of court , mr abbot s wife called her husband s incarceration disgraceful my husband and i have 50 years of dedicated service together in middletown and this is the thanks we get , she said the second teacher ordered jailed was steve antonucci , a physical education teacher and the football coach at middletown south high school , whose team won a state championship game two days ago mr antonucci said that he , too , would not return to work i love my wife and i love my family , and i 'll do anything to support them , he said the judge then sent him to the jury box to join mr abbot the two others ordered to jail were michelle armistead and patricia ayling as with their two colleagues , both said they would not comply with the order ms ayling apologized to judge fisher for wearing a baseball cap briefly when she stepped before him i'm sorry , she said , drawing laughter from teachers seated in the spectator gallery two other teachers broke ranks with their colleagues and told the judge they would return to work both were allowed to leave the courtroom judge fisher declined to order jail terms for two others on medical or family grounds , and instead fined them 50 for each day they remained out of work several others whose last names began with a were not present today and the judge said he would issue bench warrants summoning them to court at one point , the union lawyer , sanford oxfeld , interrupted the questioning and appealed to the judge to either appoint a special mediator or order the board to negotiate you 're agonizing over every single person , mr oxfeld told the judge the judge agreed mr oxfeld , he said , you 're right it does pain me to do this but this is not about what makes me feel good it s about compliance with the order both sides agree that their major bargaining disagreement is over an increase in teacher payments for their health insurance premiums the board wants to increase maximum payments from 250 a year to 860 a year the union opposes an increase , but has offered to reduce the board s expenses for health insurance premiums by no longer seeking reimbursement for their copayments on prescriptions photo as issues of

queens district attorney richard a brown intends to seek the death penalty against one of two men charged with the executionstyle murders of five workers at a wendy s fastfood restaurant in flushing last spring , several people who have been briefed on the case said yesterday but mr brown , who is expected to announce his decision tomorrow , will not seek the death penalty against the other man , whose lawyers have argued is mentally retarded and therefore cannot be put to death under new york state law the mental retardation claim catapulted the wendy s case into the highly charged national debate over who should be exempt from the death penalty in states that allow it the people briefed on the case said that mr brown had decided to pursue a capital case against john b taylor , 36 , a former employee at the wendy s , but would not do so against the second defendant , craig godineaux , 30 , a parolee who was working as a security guard at a jamaica clothing store at the time of the wendy s killings both men are charged with staging a robbery and massacre that mr brown has described as the most horrible crime he has seen in his 28 years in law enforcement on the night of last may 24 , seven employees were marched into a freezer room in the basement of the restaurant on main street , bound and gagged with duct tape , and made to kneel their heads covered with plastic bags and they were shot one by one , according to the police and prosecutors two of them survived prosecutors have said that mr godineaux confessed to shooting five workers , three of whom died mr taylor , they said , confessed to one killing if convicted , mr godineaux could face life in prison with no chance for parole mr taylor , if convicted , would face a penalty trial in which the jury would have to decide whether or not he should be given a lethal injection in seeking the death penalty against mr taylor , mr brown , who has said he is personally opposed to capital punishment , is making his fourth attempt at the death penalty in two previous cases , defendants were convicted of firstdegree murder , but were sentenced to life in prison without parole in a third , the defendant pleaded guilty to the same charge and received the same sentence since capital punishment was reinstated in new york in 1995 , prosecutors have sought the death penalty in 41 cases , not including mr taylor s , according to the state s capital defender office six people have been sentenced to death , all of whom are appealing mr taylor s lawyer , john youngblood , of the capital defender office , said yesterday that he had not been informed of mr brown s decision and would not comment until the district attorney announced it mr godineaux s lawyer , colleen brady of the legal aid society s capital division , could not be reached for comment yesterday in an earlier interview , she had declined to specify the basis of her claim that mr godineaux is mentally retarded , but insisted that he met the criteria in the state death penalty statute under the statute , mental retardation must be evident before the age of 18 and is characterized as significantly subaverage intelligence and functioning experts differ , but most classify people as mentally retarded if they have iq s below 70 to 75 and are unable to adapt to daily life unlike insanity or other mental disease , mental retardation does not mean that a defendant cannot be held responsible for a crime but new york is one of 13 states that has banned the execution of mentally retarded criminals , unless they commit a murder while in prison in november , on the eve of the state deadline for mr brown to make a decision on the death penalty in the wendy s case , he requested and received a 60day extension , saying he would use the two months to investigate ms brady s claim about mr godineaux s mental capacity until then , it had seemed likely that mr brown would seek the death penalty against both men prosecutors , armed with graphic confessions from mr taylor and mr godineaux and damning eyewitness accounts from the two survivors and another witness , have said repeatedly that the evidence against both defendants is overwhelming and many of the victims' relatives urged mr brown to seek the death penalty against the two men since ms brady raised the mental retardation claim in her defense of mr godineaux , prosecutors have been reviewing her argument and evidence from school records , iq tests and accounts from teachers , coworkers , family members and neighbors they have also had mr godineaux evaluated by their own psychologist prosecutors and defense lawyers have closely guarded the results of that part of the investigation but mr brown s decision not to seek the death penalty against mr godineaux suggests that he found merit in the defense s claim a review of several similar cases in new york state found that prosecutors have generally agreed not to seek the death penalty in those in which mental retardation was an issue , even when the defendant was considered very mildly retarded none of the cases in which prosecutors did seek the death penalty against defendants whose lawyers had argued they were mentally retarded have resulted in death sentences
shanghai , dec 4 li hao has been ready for a decade to help meet china s yawning demand for transplantable organs by donating his body after he dies , but there is currently little chance that anything other than his corneas will be used as more than a teaching tool for other donations , china does n't yet have the proper laws , lamented mr li , 63 , a former fisheries clerk , sitting in the shanghai branch of the red cross society of china without such laws , china has come to rely primarily on executed prisoners to supply organs for transplant , a secretive and unsavory practice fraught with harrowing abuses and ethical sinkholes mr li , while still exceptional in a country where traditional confucian beliefs about preserving the body make organ donation generally taboo , represents a potentially much broader and less offensive source of organs , if only the government would allow it the legal question surrounding organ donation turns on precisely when to declare a potential donor dead doctors and lawyers in china are pushing for a law that defines death as the end of brain function , instead of stoppage of the heart , as is now the case the brain death standard permits doctors in the united states and 13 other countries to extract organs while the donor s heart is still beating that is crucial because most transplantable organs need to be removed before the blood stops flowing or within minutes after the heart stops , to prevent cells from decaying china continues to define death as the cessation of heartbeat and the breathing reflex that makes organ procurement operations difficult , if not impossible , because there is no way to predict precisely when someone will die the exception , of course , is in the case of executions , of which china is expected to carry out more than 5 , 000 this year every year since 1995 , china s legislature has rejected motions to draft organ donation and brain death laws , largely out of concern that they would open the door for rampant abuses in a country where law enforcement is uneven and the incentive for abuse is very , very large there is a fear that the brain death standard could be used to commit crimes , said zhang bin , a lawyer who has helped draft annual motions asking the national people s congress to create such a law with kidney and liver transplants fetching thousands of dollars , he said , doctors in less developed parts of the country might be persuaded to declare patients brain dead prematurely but as frustration over the current standard grows , there is already an increasing temptation to harvest organs from braindead patients anyway , despite the legal risks in june several government newspapers reported the case of a 28yearold construction worker , surnamed zhao , who was declared brain dead after falling more than 30 feet while working in the northern city of xian his family suggested that his organs be used for transplants , but doctors rejected the offer because his heart was still beating and they could not legally declare him dead in another case , in july 2000 at changzheng hospital , affiliated with the shanghai no 2 military medical university , doctors performed what they said was the first transplant from a braindead patient the donor , xie haiwen , a man in his late teens from rural jiangxi province , had also fallen at a construction site , this one in shanghai , and was braindead by the time he arrived at the hospital zhu youhua , deputy director of the hospital s kidney transplant center , decided to use mr xie as a donor but did not tell his family his organs would be used for transplants everyone involved in the procurement was sworn to secrecy mr xie s family was asked to write and sign a letter donating mr xie s body to the hospital for research by the next day , though , the secret was out , and the city s health authority called dr zhu , demanding to know which government department had approved the operation dr zhu , contacted this month , said the case was still too sensitive to discuss , but he did give an account of the transplant to a beijing newspaper shortly before the national people s congress convened for its annual session this year i hope the xie haiwen case will make the npc pay greater attention this year to drafting a law on brain death in china , dr zhu told the newspaper the congress subsequently rejected the motion to draft such a law , citing a recommendation by the health ministry mr zhang , the lawyer , said that changzheng hospital evidently thought its military background gave it some protection , but that in taking organs from braindead patients , hospitals risked being accused of stealing them from someone not yet dead it s definitely not common , he said you need guts to do that a deep cultural bias against organ donation in china complicates the debate at ruijin hospital , among the most modern medical centers in shanghai , one young resident physician said few of her colleagues had responded to requests that they register as bone marrow donors most of the hospital s bone marrow donations are shipped from taiwan , where a public education campaign has made donation common most chinese are very traditional and wo n't accept organ donations , the doctor said they want the corpse complete there is also concern that application of the brain death standard could create problems if uneducated family members saw their loved ones declared dead while their hearts were still beating but the red cross , where mr li , the potential donor , was interviewed , has shown that public education can change attitudes
pittsburgh halfway across fort pitt bridge , a city of glittering office towers and graceful overpasses appears in the afternoon sun downtown pittsburgh blares prosperity but enter one of these office towers , to visit with dennis yablonsky , who tries to generate corporate investment , and a different image intrudes the slumping national economy governs his days after steel declined , pittsburgh nurtured high technology companies and dotcom startups , and as they grew , a more diversified city thrived in the 1990 s mr yablonsky s task , as president of pittsburgh digital greenhouse , an economic development initiative , is to keep the expansion flourishing the latest strategy is to make pittsburgh a center for the design of computer chips , using digital greenhouse s public and corporate money to lure companies just five companies have nibbled so far , gingerly setting up shop here , employing in total only 20 people far off the old pace of job creation we are trying to get a lot of companies to put semiconductor design centers here , but onethird to onehalf tell us they want to defer any decision and we should call back in the future , mr yablonsky said that is a message we started hearing in january everywhere in pittsburgh , and in cities like it around the country , business executives are cutting back their curtailment of investment spending and expansion plans is contributing to what now appears to be a nationwide slide toward recession that is likely to dash hopes not only among ordinary americans but on wall street and in washington for a quick recovery from the stock market rout without much damage to the economy the march employment report addd more cold water employers shed 86 , 000 jobs in march , the labor department reported on friday that was the largest drop for one month since november 1991 , when the economy was wobbling out of a recession american business is losing its exuberance , and that is now the biggest drag on the 9 trillion economy consumers are still spending , if not quite as enthusiastically as before , at least enough to hold up their end home construction and auto sales , two other pillars of the economy , remain solid , and job growth , while slowing , has not yet braked enough to push the jobless rate above a still low 43 percent capital spending is lagging , and that is starting to pull down the rest of the economy as executives wake up to overcapacity , shrinking profits and an unfriendly stock market , their spending for all sorts of ventures and equipment has fallen from an annual growth rate of 21 percent in the first quarter of 2000 to a decline of onetenth of 1 percent in the fourth quarter twothirds of the decline in the economy is a result of the pullback in business investment , the commerce department reported while mr yablonsky waits , little setbacks are weakening companies already here cities that diversified and thrived in the 1990 s , shedding their reliance on a single industry , are entering their first hard times in their new garb that exposes a different vulnerability pittsburgh , minus the steel giants , must continually add small , vigorous enterprises to sustain prosperity , and the momentum is fading the slowdown has also reduced the number of jobs that companies in pittsburgh want to fill , mr yablonsky said none have announced mass downsizings , but there have been numerous small layoffs , particularly among the onceflourishing startups like onlinechoicecom , founded by sanjay chopra , a 33yearold carnegie mellon university graduate , who won an entrepreneur of the year award in pittsburgh in 2000 last month , mr chopra was removed as chief executive it is surprising how quickly markets evaporate , he said afterward the idea behind onlinechoice is to recruit thousands of consumers over the internet and combine their buying power to purchase items like phone services , electricity or insurance at a discount unable to turn a profit or obtain new venture capital since last spring , online has shrunk to 15 employees from 60 and far from investing in equipment , it has sold 12 idle computers , an extra copier and the office coffeemaker onlinechoice s experience helps to explain the increase in pittsburgh s unemployment rate , to 41 percent lately from an average of 37 percent last year that is still slight , but many companies are no longer expanding as a result , job applicants wait , wages are rising more slowly and bonuses are smaller the ma s and phd s coming out of our universities used to have jobs before they graduated , said wilbur s harmon , vice president for human resources at ansys , which develops software to test products and is one of the few dotcoms here still hiring now they are graduating without jobs outwardly , the city seems to be thriving the university of pittsburgh medical center , the city s largest employer , with 28 , 000 on the payroll , continues to expand , partly through acquisitions home sales are strong , and new office buildings , started last summer before the slowdown , are in midconstruction while the city has lost more than 100 , 000 steel jobs , it has replaced them with jobs in other industries

tampa , fla it has been an odd time for giants running back ron dayne it is super bowl week , and he has been excited , even giddy , about being here for the most part , he has been in high spirits , joking with teammates , smiling , playing with a video camera and yet , although he does not want to rock the boat and has not done so in any way he is concerned about what his role will be in super bowl xxxv according to teammates , dayne told several giants players this week that he fears he will be virtually invisible in the super bowl because the game plan will call for him to have very few carries when asked if he knew that his role would not be a significant one , dayne responded yeah , kind of , i know , but that s all right i do n't mind as long as i'm doing something to help the team when asked just how he knew that his number of carries would be relatively few , dayne said , i can tell just from the feel of practice meaning , in practice , dayne is probably getting little work if this is indeed true , then dayne will have only a handful of carries and pass receptions in the game on one level , this make sense the hardhitting defense of baltimore is geared toward stopping big backs the ravens have a huge defensive line , and the best defensive player in football , linebacker ray lewis , is capable of chasing down the swiftest of backs , let alone the bigger , slower ones like dayne the closest player in the league to dayne in size and athleticism is probably pittsburgh running back jerome bettis , who like dayne weighs about 250 pounds bettis had only 73 total rushing yards in two games against the ravens still , dayne feels he could do some damage against baltimore dayne told several teammates this week that because of his strength he would be a serious rushing threat in the super bowl because he would be able to inflict as much punishment on baltimore as the ravens did on runners i do n't feel like i'm scared of those guys , dayne said , referring to the ravens' defenders i want the coaches to put me in , as much as they can , as much as they want to , as much as the game plan allows dayne s comments seem to indicate that the giants will do what several other teams that have had success against baltimore have tried , which is go to a quicker , more uptempo offense , meaning that running back tiki barber will most likely be the center of the giants' attack none of this is a state secret , of course though dayne s blunt words , in a private moment , were probably the most interesting news of the day and rest assured there is nothing the giants can do offensively that the ravens have not seen baltimore s defensive coordinator , marvin lewis , said he expected a varied attack from the giants , probably much of it through the air , and some on the ground with barber the first thing you have to do with the giants is make sure your players understand all of the things the giants do with the shifting and motion before the snap , lewis said then , after that , i expect them to try and throw the ball and i'm sure barber will be a big part of what they try to do he s a good , quick back dayne has been criticized for what some have called an unproductive rookie year in which his output fell off late in the season yet , while dayne does need to improve his study habits by watching more film of opposing defenses , he has actually had a solid season over all dayne ran for 770 yards and 5 touchdowns , the secondhighest rushing total for a firstyear player in team history , bettered only by tuffy leeman s 830 yards in 1936 what dayne does need to do in the super bowl , with the few carries he will get , is run with more authority dayne has tended to tiptoe through holes , and that point was crystallized by a recent incident in which the wife of linebacker mike barrow , shelley , who has watched hours of game film herself , noticed that dayne would sometimes hesitate when running you know it s tough when even the players' wives are being critical yesterday , after talking of the serious subject of his lack of expected carries , dayne spoke about a superstition he has before games , when he gets dressed , dayne always starts putting on his clothes from the left part of his body to the right , beginning with his socks dayne says the routine helps him stay focused dayne is getting better at the game of professional football he s not there yet , but in the future , dayne will almost certainly become an extremely productive back it just wo n't be in super bowl xxxv photo ron dayne thinks he can hurt the ravens if given the chance \( vincent laforet the new york times \)
just over a year ago , america s biggest , oldest , most prosperous corporations were about to be slaughtered by the dotcom insurgents retailers fantasized about trading acres of floor space for a slick web site financial services giants quaked at the arrival of online banks that got it media executives fretted that online newspapers and internet broadcasters would arise from the ether to capture their audiences consultants everywhere were prophesying doom for the fortune 500 the actual word , recalled thomas stemberg , the chief executive of staples , was 'disintermediated' it meant you were going to be taken out of the equation mr stemberg is one of hundreds of executives at large , publicly held companies who spent millions of dollars over the last three years to fend off what now looks like a nasdaqfueled mass hallucination staples , nbc and credit suisse first boston are just a few of the companies that recently announced plans to buy back the internet units they had spun off to try to thwart the dotcom threat at prices much lower than most shareholders had paid for them the specter of getting amazoned , which justified many a spending spree in the name of warding off webbased competitors , lost its zing as the shares of amazoncom plummeted and as another online bookseller , barnesandnoblecom , started taking some of its market share toys r us , for example , has poured 260 million into toysruscom , according to regulatory filings , only to watch etoys , its online archrival , file for bankruptcy this year hindsight in the wake of a 60 percent nasdaq correction is easy , of course , and there has already been much fingerpointing amid the poppedcom compulsion to explain a market bubble that , however briefly , valued amazon over barnes noble , etoys over toys r us and palm computing over its venerable parent , 3com but if wall street analysts and venture capitalists are blamed for spinning unrealistic tales of dotcom success for investors , the most outspoken internet boosters in corporate america were the strategy consultants who supplied the buzzwords and business rationales that seemed to justify what might otherwise have been dismissed as a market aberration in a raft of books , newsletters and seminars , supposedly impartial experts from consulting firms and academia extolled the virtues of entrepreneurialism among 20somethings they warned corporate managers of the disruptive power of technology , and urged them to embrace it and many of them went on to reap extraordinary profits over the last few years , advising corporate clients to invest in online ventures that turned out to be largely unprofitable the consultant fraternity was after everybody , said brian t moynihan , executive vice president of fleetboston financial , who said he discarded most of the advice , although he paid for much of it they were all pushing that the internet was going to change everything the internet missteps of many established companies , which emerged as winners in an ultimately notsoepic battle , have largely been glossed over in the aftermath but now , as corporate executives assess their own performance during the boom time or are forced to by shareholders many lament the expensive internet advice that did n't pan out with big corporations trimming spending on internet initiatives , and on the advisers who helped conceptualize them , the consultants may finally be asked to account for their previous miscalculations before being invited to submit new ones it s the same story all over again with wireless , said janey place , an executive vice president at mellon financial , referring to recent admonitions that mobile commerce requires companies to make banking and other services available over wireless networks we 've learned not to take some of these projections seriously facing this increased skepticism , some consultants have turned openly apologetic but others are unrepentant , and most , being consultants , are simply offering a new spin on the notsonew economy this was a tough way to learn important lessons , said chunka mui , coauthor of unleashing the killer app digital strategies for market dominance , and chief innovation officer at the consulting firm diamondcluster international given what the markets have done , there s a risk that people will say we do n't have to worry about this anymore , and i think that would be a fatal mistake the real lesson here is to recognize that the technology itself is of a transformational nature besides , some consultants note , managers are free to take or reject their advice as they please i'm sure there s somebody out there who thinks they should blame the consultants , said bob gett , chief executive of viant , a startup consulting firm that specializes in technology strategy they may feel a little embarrassed about how enthusiastic they got about the digital imperative but these are executives they make their own decisions , and they live with the results
san francisco , may 13 a new class of cancer drugs is showing promise in treating patients who have not responded to chemotherapy , researchers at a major cancer conference said this weekend the drugs interfere with a protein known as egfr , which plays a crucial role in the growth and survival of tumor cells as such , the drugs are representative of a new strategy to aim at particular proteins involved in cancer formation this approach , although with a different target , is used by gleevec , the novartis drug that has shown remarkable results against a certain form of leukemia it was approved by the food and drug administration last week we 're going to be making lots of drugs that attack the cause of cancer like we made antibiotics that attacked the cause of infection , dr john mendelsohn , president of the university of texas m d anderson cancer center in houston , said at the annual meeting here of the american society of clinical oncology still , experts say that the drugs being developed are not cancer cures and that it is unclear how long they will prolong patients' lives the first of the egfrblocking drugs could come to market as early as next year from imclone systems , based in new york astrazeneca , the british pharmaceutical company , is in the final stage of clinical trials for its drug iressa , which is being tested in lungcancer patients and osi pharmaceuticals of long island , working with roche and genentech , is in the second of three trials for various cancers colin goddard , osi s chairman , said if all went well , the drug could reach the market in 2004 , about a year behind astrazeneca s researchers reported here that imclone s drug , used in combination with an existing cancer drug , significantly shrank tumors in 225 percent of colorectal cancer patients whose disease was not responding to either of the drugs now used to treat it imclone executives said the results exceeded the 15 percent response rate they think is needed for the drug , known as c225 , to win fda approval the company plans to apply for approval in june dr leonard b saltz , who led the trials , emphasized that the treatment was not a cure even the patients who respond will ultimately have their cancer progress and ultimately die of the disease , he said dr saltz , of the memorial sloankettering cancer center , said there was anecdotal evidence that the patients who responded to the drug lived longer than the expected five months for such patients but he said it was impossible to say anything definitive about survival because the trial was not designed to measure that egfr , the protein whose action is blocked by the new drugs , stands for epidermal growth factor receptor , a structure on the surface of most cells when the proper growth factor binds to this receptor , it sets off a series of reactions that spur cell growth and retard cell death while normal cells might have 10 , 000 copies of this receptor , cancer cells can have more than one million , said dr mendelsohn , who did the initial development of c225 the receptor is also called her1 and is in the same family as her2 , the protein blocked by herceptin , a breastcancer drug sold by genentech about 30 percent of breastcancer patients can be treated with herceptin because their tumors have an excess of her2 but the new drugs could be applicable to many more patients with a wide variety of cancers studies have shown that as many as 70 percent to 80 percent of colon cancer , prostate cancer , lung cancer and head and neck cancers might have an excess of egfr blocking egfr tends not to kill tumors , but blocks their growth but that can be important for some patients it also raises the prospect that cancer might one day become a chronic disease like diabetes or , to some extent , aids , with patients remaining alive for years even though their tumors are not eradicated our first step is turning cancer into chronic disease , and then we 'll think about cures , said dr susan desmondhellmann , chief medical officer at genentech studies have also shown that the new drugs interfere with the ability of tumor cells to recover from chemotherapy or radiation , thereby enhancing the effectiveness of those treatments one drug pfizer is developing shows truly dramatic synergy with radiation , said dr paul m harari of the university of wisconsin none of the patients in imclone s trial had responded to irinotecan , an existing drug it was the combination of c225 and irinotecan that shrank tumors in 225 percent of the patients when the egfr drugs are used without other drugs , the results can be less impressive in studies presented here , the drug being developed by osi , genentech and roche , when used by itself , shrank tumors in 5 percent of head and neck cancer patients and 12 percent of lung cancers , results roughly in line with chemotherapy drugs while some experts called this a positive proof of concept , some doctors in the audience were unimpressed , particularly with the head and neck results there are two types of egfrblocking drugs imclone s c225 and a few others in earlier stages of development , including one from cuba , are monoclonal antibodies those are engineered versions of the proteins the body uses to fight off germs and are given intravenously they bind to the receptors protruding from the tumor cell surface , preventing the intended growth factor from binding the drugs being tested by astrazeneca , osi and pfizer are pills that block the action inside the cells that are set off by egfr so some doctors here said that it might be possible to use two or more of the drugs in combination the drugs do have side effects , though they seem mild compared with most chemotherapy the main side effect , seen in more than half the patients , is an acnelike skin rash about onethird of the patients treated with osi s drug had diarrhea and about 3 percent of the patients who received imclone s drug experienced severe and possibly lifethreatening allergic reactions
mount sinai when an underground environmental group sought credit for ruining a cold spring harbor cornfield last summer , it left behind a graffiti message denouncing genetic engineering but the crops , it turned out , were never genetically altered when the elusive group , the earth liberation front , announced on new year s eve that it had firebombed some luxury houses under construction on old farmland in mount sinai , it used more graffiti messages stop urban sprawl and if you build it we will burn it but lennard axinn , the builder who was targeted that snowy dec 30 morning , played a role in saving nearly 18 acres of land across the street from the upscale subdivision for a park , a model use of open space mr axinn is considered by mainstream east end environmentalists to be a gem among developers for his friendly dealings with the greens he was conscious of the environment , said lori baldassare , president of the mount sinai civic association , said of mr axinn he wanted to work with the community , which is always a welcome change for a developer i am not really sure why they picked that development to target we have been trying to figure it out ourselves it has not gone unnoticed by federal and local authorities tracking the group that news bulletins about long island actions released by an earth liberation front spokesman in portland , ore , are chockfull of errors those bulletins have miscalculated the scope of damage \( fire gutted one unit in one building in a middle island condominium complex , not 16 nearly completed luxury homes , as claimed \) overestimated the economic value of their destruction \( 200 , 000 worth of fire and smoke damage in middle island , rather than the 35 million claimed \) and gotten simple facts wrong \( the communique claimed the mount sinai attack was on dec 29 , when in fact it was a day later \) tactically , there have been mistakes too the crude incendiary devices used in a dec 9 arson at an upscale subdivision in middle island malfunctioned in three of four cases when slowburning punks affixed to plastic jugs of gasoline did not ignite a blaze the group replaced the punks with birthday candles in the mount sinai arson , but even then one device malfunctioned , the police said rather than allknowing defenders of the earth who strike with pinpoint precision and then vanish , the group known by the acronym elf is beginning to emerge as the gang of militant environmentalists that could not shoot straight some people are even wondering why elf has targeted long island , a place whose gentle hills and heaving surf have long been a magnet for people looking to live far enough but not too far from the city long island would not make it on a mainstream environmentalist s top 10 list of national causes , said eric a goldstein , an attorney with the natural resources defense council and daniel f becker of the sierra club said long island s environmental problems are not radically better nor radically worse than many other suburban areas in the united states long island is in no great distress from a major industrial contaminant it is not some povertystricken community living in the shadow of a gigantic oil refinery and it does not have any crown jewels of the national park system that might be perceived as threatened its farms are vanishing in a cloud of developers' dust , but they are farms , after all , not pristine wilderness the island s wildest area , the pine barrens , is mostly protected from development i'm baffled , richard l amper , jr , executive director of the long island pine barrens society , said when asked why he thought the earth liberation front has turned up in suffolk county they may have picked a place that is a paradigm for overdevelopment , but the audience did n't need the message , mr amper said it is like bringing us a telegram saying , 'world war ii is over' we know ! but in many ways , long island may be the perfect place to gain attention for such a movement a quintessential suburb , it has been host to a longrunning debate on land use preservationists against developers is an old story but in recent years that debate has grown hotter today , there is not one town on the east end that does not have some land dispute robert s deluca , president of the group for the south fork , described the island as a perfect laboratory for anarchy for the last 50 years , farmland has been disappearing at the rate of 1 , 200 acres per year as the population of eastern long island has tripled since 1960 , mr deluca said he added that the number of farms in suffolk has gone from 2 , 200 to 600 in the last decade we invented suburbia , said steven englebright , a democratic state assemblyman from setauket long island has been a crucible for environmental issues resulting from our society s confrontation with crowding , transportation problems , air quality and water quality none of which is new mr englebright first ran for suffolk county legislator on the issue of preserving open space back in 1983 now , nearly 20 years later , the issue is bigger than ever
one thing was missing in the conference room there was no clock on the wall that kind of room usually has a clock then again , none of the several dozen people who gathered there yesterday really needed one they had their own clocks , a barely muffled ticking in their heads that told them yet again as if they needed the reminder that it was getting late , very late time is not on the side of holocaust survivors and their representatives who are trying to squeeze some measure of justice out of the longago nazi terror to say this is hackneyed by now but clich s are often true this one sure is the survivors are old , and anything done on their behalf had better come soon that much was obvious yesterday with a new turn in the long campaign to get some sort of compensation for the nazis' victims , most of them jews , tens of thousands of them living in and around new york city so far , there has been a lot of talk now it is time to collect , and on more than just money justice can never be done , said gideon taylor , executive vice president of the conference on jewish material claims against germany , a group based in new york what can be done are symbolic statements , a recognition of suffering , a recognition of what happened first , some background , because this business of payback can make you dizzy there have been bunches of settlements in the last few years to give survivors a piece of what they lost six decades ago keeping all the arrangements straight is n't easy but basically , thanks to various jewish groups , survivors' lawyers and american government officials , compensation agreements have been reached with germany , switzerland , austria , france , the netherlands , half a dozen european insurance companies and others pledges to settle holocaustera claims total more than 9 billion and up to now , almost none of it has actually been paid that was the reason for the gathering yesterday in the clockless conference room of the american jewish joint distribution committee , an aid agency with offices on third avenue payup time has arrived at issue is a 5 billion deal struck by the united states and germany last summer after half a century of retreating into heavyduty denial , the german government and german companies agreed to compensate people who were slave workers in concentration camps or forced laborers in factories and on farms during the nazi era worldwide , these people number in the hundreds of thousands but the concern yesterday was with an estimated 160 , 000 jews around the world involved in the german deal they include more than 50 , 000 in north america , perhaps 30 , 000 of them in the new york region they were urged at a news conference to start applying at last for this german money , a registration process that will stretch into august information is available by dialing \( 800 \) 6976064 , or going to a web site , www claimscon org not a pfennig has been paid yet , in part because of lingering court disputes even when the money begins to flow , no one is going to get rich the top individual payment will be about 7 , 500 many will get a good deal less than that it is n't only about money , though there is no way to pay for the death and the looting , said alan g hevesi , the city comptroller he and h carl mccall , the state comptroller , had used their power over rich pension funds to help bring about a 125 billion compensation deal with swiss banks a couple of years ago there has to be historical recognition , mr hevesi said , and the payments provide part of that for many survivors , applying for the german money will not be easy nearly all are in their 70 s and 80 s some are sure to be daunted by something as simple as an application form we went through 17 drafts of the form , mr taylor said we went through every single word do we need this one , could we throw that one out \? beth zeidel works with survivors at selfhelp community services , a new york agency that has long counseled sufferers of nazi persecution she has seen how the smallest bureaucratic step can knock some aging people for a loop , bringing back terrible memories you get something like a form with an official heading and it just sets off an emotional cascade , ms zeidel said and then there s the clock , that relentless clock the gathering yesterday did not last long , about an hour it was enough time , statistics suggest , for a couple of more survivors to die
kinshasa , congo , april 15 with a new government in congo that has expressed openness to united nations peacekeeping efforts , there is growing pressure on uganda and rwanda to rein in their activities in support of congo rebels , united nations and congolese officials and western diplomats say a ugandanbacked rebellion in the country s northwest is the single holdout in refusing to comply with an agreement to withdraw its troops nine miles from the front lines but the refusal of rwandanbacked rebels in the major eastern city of kisangani to allow peacekeepers to land over the weekend represented the main problem for the united nations , which has stationed about 500 peacekeepers so far in governmentheld territory but none on rebelheld ground kamel morjane , the united nations' special envoy to congo , the former zaire , said in a statement that the decision by the rwandanbacked rebels puts in jeopardy the process of peace in an interview before the kisangani incident , mr morjane said sometimes i really wonder whether rwanda and uganda are really willing to leave congo i'm not sure that s why i'm saying we have to push we should not let this window of opportunity close the government of the late laurent kabila had been considered the major stumbling block to peace but over the weekend , mr morjane told a state television reporter that the united nations' relationship with government of joseph kabila , who took over after his father s assassination , was perfect the new president has already visited the new administration in washington , and that has accompanied a major shift in relations between congo s warring parties and the rest of the world the government in kinshasa with , more important , its zimbabwean and angolan allies has seized on this shift over the weekend , mr kabila announced a new cabinet , which included only one hardliner from his father s government and which immediately received the endorsement of belgium , the country s former colonial ruler leonard she okitundu , one of the few reformers from the father s cabinet and a man respected in the west , was reappointed foreign minister he called for united nations sanctions against the rebels , who have been demanding that the united nations condemn supposed government violations of the ceasefire in an interview last week here in the capital , mr kabila , 29 , also called on the west to be tougher against rwanda and uganda , which have backed congolese rebels and sent its own troops to fight in the nearly threeyearold war the security council has so far committed 3 , 500 peacekeepers to the congo personally , i would like to see justice being done , mr kabila said the west should be there to say 'mister , you 've' aggressed a country get out of that' he also noted that the west has stationed many peacekeepers in tiny kosovo , adding and here we send 3 , 500 men what a joke the reality is , of course , more nuanced to begin with , laurent kabila became congo s president only after the rwandans and ugandans plucked him from obscurity in 1996 , and they supported him until a falling out led to this war in august 1998 he never held elections and ruled brutally many congolese regarded his presidency as they do the son s as illegitimate still , if the younger kabila is making the same points that his father did , the west , this time , seems more inclined to listen the west has grown increasingly impatient with rwanda and uganda , which claimed to have entered the congo to protect their borders , and yet showed an equal , if not greater , interest in plundering the country s mineral riches rwandan officials contend that people who carried out mass killings in their country in 1994 are still taking refuge across the border in congo an independent panel reporting to the united nations security council issued a report on monday listing dozens of firms it said were involved in exporting congo s minerals via rwanda the change in leadership in washington is yet another reason for the shift in focus toward the congo situation uganda and rwanda were two of the clinton administration s staunchest african allies many congolese contend that a guiltridden clinton administration which eventually apologized to the new rwandan administration for not having intervened in the 1994 killings looked the other way as rwanda conducted this war in congo there was a genocide in rwanda that each and every human being must condemn , mr kabila said last week but when people try to use this problem of genocide as a weapon against another nation , which is basically what happened in the congo , that s why you have a problem with a new administration in washington , the kinshasa government saw an opportunity to make its case , congolese and diplomats here said soon after becoming president in january , mr kabila visited washington the bush administration was reported to have received him more warmly than it did paul kagame , the president of rwanda , who paid a visit at the same time a harder approach toward rwanda and uganda in the united nations security council became immediately noticeable , said mr morjane , the special envoy here , attributing it in part to the change in the white house the republicans were not in power in 1994 , so they are being more pragmatic , he said because of its seemingly boundless natural resources , congo s fate has often been determined by outsiders there are worries here that , with the country weakened as it has never been , that will happen again rwanda and uganda do not have the will to leave , said litchoke likutu , a politician and businessman whose coffee plantations near kisangani are occupied by ugandans and rebels they will leave only if there is international pressure on them others expressed the worry that even if the rwandans and ugandans left , the west would not press hard for political openness western powers have always put their political and economic interests first in the congo , said florentin mokonda , an economist at the university of kinshasa and a former chief of staff to mr mobutu our worry is that they will become enamored with a strongman like joseph kabila because he will serve their interests but not really promote democratic reform here map of congo highlighting kinshasa the west has warmed to the new administration in kinshasa

on a farm near madison , wis , are some of the world s most costly and wellprotected cows people entering their climatecontrolled steel and concrete barns have to shower first to keep the cows from becoming infected the cows have been genetically engineered to produce pharmaceuticals in their milk some biotechnology executives think such animals may be the pharmaceutical factories of the future but today the roughly 45 cows face an uncertain fate the company that created them , the pharming group , which is based in the netherlands , has run out of money and filed for protection from its creditors pharming s problems suggest that the dream of producing drugs in milk has begun to fade ppl therapeutics , the scottish company that cloned dolly the sheep and is also trying to produce drugs in milk , nearly ran out of money before raising about 45 million recently genzyme transgenics of framingham , mass , while flush with cash , changed chief executives in july , and its stock has dropped from above 45 last year to about 4 now the problems of the drugsfrommilk business could also deal a blow to animal cloning companies because replicating such drugproducing animals was expected to be one of the biggest applications of cloning indeed , pharming s cows were created with the help of infigen , a wisconsin cloning company the troubles are occurring at a time when it would seem the use of genetically modified animals would be in great demand that is because the biotechnology industry is suffering from a severe shortage of conventional manufacturing capacity , spurring the need for alternatives like drugproducing animals biotechnology drugs are generally human proteins like insulin or growth hormone that are manufactured by putting the gene for the protein into bacteria or hamster cells , then multiplying those cells in stainless steel fermentation tanks a big manufacturing plant requires several years and 100 million to 500 million to build putting the gene for the human protein into animals and then purifying the protein from milk is a cheaper alternative , backers say you 're talking about investments in animals and barns and milking facilities rather than stainless steel reactors , said tom newberry , a spokesman for genzyme transgenics the biggest advantage of using animals may be to produce drugs that are needed in large quantities because they are given in high doses ppl and its partner , bayer , are now holding clinical trials of a protein produced in transgenic sheep called alpha1 antitrypsin , which is used to treat emphysema and cystic fibrosis bayer already gets the protein from human blood but can only make enough for 3 , 500 patients but 2 , 000 transgenic sheep could make enough for 20 , 000 to 40 , 000 people , said ron james , ppl s chief executive but despite the theoretical advantages , the earliest that drugs made in animals will be on the market is 2003 for one thing , it is not yet clear how readily the food and drug administration will approve such drugs among other things , drugproducing animals will have to be certified as free of mad cow disease or other serious infectious illnesses genzyme transgenics has signed more than a dozen deals with drug companies to explore producing drugs in transgenic goats johnson johnson and bristolmyers squibb have signed agreements for two drugs apiece but none of the companies has actually made a commitment to begin clinical trials with a drug produced in milk you 're at a point where you 've got to execute , said william tanner , an analyst at sg cowen this is not a problem of getting more partners or getting more goats it s a question of getting someone to pull the trigger genzyme transgenics planned to have its own drug from goat milk approved first it finished clinical trials of antithrombiniii for use in certain patients undergoing coronary bypass surgery but when the fda requested more data , genzyme transgenics dropped the drug , saying the potential sales would be too small to justify the expense that decision , early this year , sent the company s stock tumbling and genzyme now acknowledges that it was a mistake geoffrey f cox , who took over as chief executive in july , said the company will pursue new clinical trials to get antithrombiniii approved for a different use by 2003 sales might be small , dr cox said , but the real goal is to demonstrate that a drug produced in animal milk can win approval we need to establish through our own leadership the sense of confidence in the regulation of transgenic products , he said in addition to regulatory hurdles , it can take 18 months to begin getting a drug from an animal to produce drugs in a goat or sheep , a gene must first be inserted into an embryo , which can take several months then the embryo must be implanted in the womb of a surrogate mother , which will give birth five months later it then takes six months for the goat or sheep to reach sexual maturity and another five months for that animal to give birth and begin producing milk with cows , which have a longer gestation period , it takes even longer if an animal does produce enough of a drug in its milk , it can be the founding animal of a herd but if not , the whole process must start again by contrast , conventional production in hamster cells can yield small amounts of protein in a few months , allowing clinical trials to begin more quickly even pharming ended up switching to conventional manufacturing using hamster cells for its first drug a treatment for a rare genetic disorder , pompe s disease after starting with genetically engineered rabbits if you are in a clinical program and need to scale up quickly , they duplicate every 24 hours , rein strijker , senior vice president at pharming , said of hamster cells even rabbits , though they breed like rabbits , do n't duplicate in 24 hours but the shift to hamster cells added an extra financial burden for pharming and undercut its claims for its own technology pharming s failure is affecting several american organizations most of the cows in wisconsin were engineered to make either fibrinogen , a woundsealing protein pharming was developing with the american red cross , or human collagen 1 for tissue repair , which was being developed with cohesion technologies of palo alto , calif pharming was also working with baxter healthcare on a protein known as human c1 inhibitor for the treatment of hereditary angioedema pharming executives say they hope to raise money soon and emerge from receivership they say the technology will find a place given the need for alternatives to conventional manufacturing meanwhile , new startup companies are trying to produce drugs in genetically modified plants , in the eggs of genetically altered chickens and even in the semen of genetically engineered hogs the stumbles of the transgenic animals companies could allow some of these competitors to catch up or it could merely show them the pitfalls that are ahead
an unexpected new order of world powers has emerged , at least in the field of human embryonic stem cell research the roster , say scientists who back the research , is evidence of the inventiveness of the newcomers but also shows how much the usual powerhouses of biomedical research in the united states and europe have been held back by political and ethical debate the national institutes of health yesterday announced the organizations that had developed colonies of human embryonic stem cells before aug 9 , the cutoff date set by president bush in allowing federal money to be used for research sweden led the pack with colonies derived from 24 different embryos , followed by the united states with 20 , india with 10 , australia with 6 and israel with 4 with any other biotech material you 'd find a dramatically different list , a senior american biologist said on condition of anonymity that s a telling comment on how much we have been held back dr james d watson , president of the cold spring harbor laboratory , said , we 've been held back , there is no doubt but dr watson noted that even if research had begun earlier , several critical tools for analyzing human embryonic stem cells , like the human genome sequence and dna chips , had only just become available in an interview from london , the secretary of health and human services , tommy g thompson , said that the president had set a definable policy that would allow research to go forward and that now is not the time to be looking for excuses but to be moving full speed ahead the human genome , for instance , was decoded by an international coalition whose leading members were the united states and britain , with contributions from germany , france , japan and china none of the last five countries are yet known to have derived human embryonic stem cells the absence of britain from the list is notable because british biologists developed the technique for growing embryonic stem cells from mouse embryos , the underpinning of the methods that others have used with human cells the british agency that regulates research with embryos only allowed them to be used for exploring tissue regeneration a few months ago , too late for british researchers to translate their lead with mouse embryonic cells to humans unlike the costlier forms of biological research , like the dna sequencing machines required in genomics , cell culture has fewer barriers to entry this , and the absence of political dissent , may be why two organizations in india , reliance life sciences of bombay and the national center for biological sciences in bangalore , have been able to develop nihapproved human embryonic stem cells reliance life sciences is part of reliance , a large oil and textile conglomerate dr firuza parikh , the founder and director of the company , said in an interview that its goal was to make the cells mature into tissues and organs like the heart , pancreas and central nervous system there are no religious , cultural , political or social barriers to this research in india , she said dr parikh , who is a fertility expert and visiting professor at yale university medical school , said that with a group of 60 researchers , reliance s goal was to put india in the forefront of global biotech work the cells owned by reliance and the other nine organizations on the national institutes of health list are probably enough for governmentsupported biologists in the united states to get started , many scientists believe , even though questions about the availability , quality and terms of use of the cells remain open give me the cells , and i 'll give you the answer , said dr ronald d mckay of the health institutes at least two of the cell owners on the nih list , cythera of san diego and reliance life sciences , have made clear that they intend to do more work on characterizing their cells before making them generally available scientists are also waiting for the outcome of negotiations between the health institutes and the wisconsin alumni research foundation as to the terms under which nih researchers may use the cells derived at the university of wisconsin but even if research now starts in earnest and its promise is fulfilled , many scientists believe it will be necessary to derive cells from new embryos before clinical applications can begin with time , people will want more than those 60 cells , dr watson said tony mazzaschi , associate vice president of the association of american medical colleges , said that limiting the number of embryonic stem cell lines colonies of selfperpetuating cells available to federally financed scientists was unwise public policy this may allow some limited basic research to get started , mr mazzaschi said , but i do n't think anybody thinks this list will be sufficient when we start going into clinical research mr thompson , the secretary of health and human services , said that he was not open to the idea of deriving new cells for government researchers to work on , but that there were no restrictions on the private sector the administration has set a policy , he said , but this does not impede anything the private sector wants to do it s normal for basic research to get to a certain point , then therapy and human trials are usually done by the private sector but dr irving weissman , a leading stem cell researcher at stanford university , said that because of the fundamental nature of embryonic stem cells and their ability to construct the entire human body , most of the important research is going to go on at academic centers for some time dr weissman said that lack of new cell lines would probably have a restraining effect on research , and he suggested that the president s new council on bioethics might provide a mechanism for reviewing the policy all of us are sensitive to how far bush came to make these decisions , and the real issue would be whether his bioethics panel will consider reasonable arguments for new cell lines to be created , dr weissman said
houston , march 10 for the last five months , the soap opera enthralling this city with an appreciation for scandal is the lawsuit over the estate of an oilman , j howard marshall ii and the tempestuous star has been mr marshall s widow , the former stripper and pinup girl anna nicole smith but when the jury this week unanimously found that ms smith was entitled to none of her husband s money and even punished mr marshall s older son with a 353 million fine , the winner was the man who had unexpectedly become the costar of the show rusty hardin , the lawyer whom jurors had privately nicknamed bulldog with his relentless crossexamination of ms smith , highlights of which dominated local newscasts , mr hardin , 59 , has become so well known that strangers shout at him on the street and what they usually shout might seem strange the same twoword rhyming insult uttered in court by an exasperated ms smith it just took on a life of its own , mr hardin recalled , laughing , telling of how spectators at a houston rockets basketball game last month serenaded him with vulgar but friendly catcalls a few days later , courthouse maintenance workers used the same cheer the woman at the cleaners told me how much she enjoyed going home at night to get her rusty and anna nicole fix , he added energetic and irrepressible , mr hardin , admits that he loves the attention and that he expects a slight letdown now that the trial is over but he will not be idle for long mr hardin is one of the most soughtafter lawyers in a city known for its elite legal talent a former prosecutor now in private practice , mr hardin has extricated some of houston s most prominent citizens from ticklish legal entanglements people come to me when they have a problem , he said simply a recent client is mark mckinnon , a senior adviser to president bush , who became caught in controversy during the presidential race when a copy of mr bush s debate preparation materials was stolen from his office and mailed to an ally of thenvice president al gore mr mckinnon s employee and baby sitter , juanita yvette lozano , was indicted in the theft this week , and mr hardin said federal officials had assured him that his client was not a suspect seated in his 33rdfloor office overlooking downtown houston , mr hardin is surrounded by mementos of past triumphs his bragging wall of photographs includes the former houston oilers quarterback warren moon \( cleared of assaulting his wife \) and the houston rockets' coach , rudy tomjanovich \( cleared of drunken driving \) in civil court , mr hardin won a 65 million verdict for the family of a 98yearold resident molested in a nursing home he has the ability , like david boies , to talk and smile at the same time , said dan gerson , a criminal defense lawyer and host of a local public affairs television program , reasonable doubt , referring to the lawyer who represented mr gore before the supreme court jurors like that he has a certain charisma his ability to win over the jury in the marshall trial was evident after the verdict , when the jurors sang him an impromptu version of you light up my life , the debby boone pop ballad the late mr marshall was 89 in 1994 when he married ms smith , who was then 26 during the trial , one of ms smith s lawyers often noted that mr marshall called his young wife the light of my life so in his closing arguments , mr hardin played the chorus of the song i said i had something i thought might capture the spirit of the trial , he recalled of his closing argument then debby boone s voice started singing and the jury cracked up mr hardin grew up in monroe , nc , a small town near charlotte , but has lived in texas since he graduated in 1975 from the law school at southern methodist university in dallas he spent 15 years as an assistant district attorney in houston , never losing a felony case , and was named the texas state bar s prosecutor of the year in 1989 the next year he went into private practice as a civil trial and criminal defense lawyer his primary client , of late , has been e pierce marshall , 62 , the son whom the houston jury deemed the rightful inheritor of his father s estate , valued at 40 million to 2 billion , depending on who is counting when the trial began last fall , it was fairly tedious but the city perked up for three days in early february , when mr hardin crossexamined ms smith he questioned her over and over again to paint her as a liar and challenged her central claim that her husband had promised her half of everything by day 2 , mr hardin had her so exasperated that she was cursing and tossing out accusations the judge even reprimanded her outside the jury s presence this is not to say , though , that e pierce marshall can start spending the money last year , a federal bankruptcy judge in california awarded ms smith 475 million mr marshall is appealing , and with his texas victory in hand is heading back to court in california mr hardin , who is not a bankruptcy lawyer , is not likely to be involved , which will undoubtedly disappoint local fans of the rusty and anna nicole show i do , mr hardin

when gordon j davis , the president of lincoln center , convened the directors of the center s resident performing groups on sept 12 , the day after the attack on the world trade center , the shock of the disaster was fresh , and life in new york was virtually frozen but mr davis believed that it was important to meet , partly to decide what to do next , and partly to make sure that all of the arts center s constituent organizations were fully informed about plans for everything from memorial concerts being planned to heightened security on the plaza and in the halls and backstage areas lincoln center had been evacuated immediately after the attack planning , fundraising and administrative work came to a halt , box offices were closed and rehearsals were canceled so were openingnight fundraising galas at the new york city opera on the night of the attack and at the chamber music society of lincoln center the next night similar events at other lincoln center organizations were scrapped as well , and the first five concerts of the rachmaninoff retrospective that was to have opened lincoln center s great performers series were also canceled when it became clear that the performers , from england and russia , could not get to new york at the lincoln center meeting , mr davis and his colleagues agreed that it was time to get back to work , if not quite back to business as usual other organizations have approached their seasons with a similar resolve and although several say that they are likely to face substantial financial losses because of the disaster , executives at large and small concert halls in new york agree that the structure of musical life in the city seasonal rather than yearround , and with an audience that is mostly local rather than dependent on tourism has shielded them from the devastating drop in ticket sales on broadway there have been some difficult decisions , mr davis said of his discussions with colleagues at lincoln center probably the hardest call was at the new york city opera , which had planned to resume its performances with 'the magic flute' on friday but on thursday , when the president announced that friday would be a day of mourning , we scheduled a vigil on the plaza , and city opera had to decide whether to cancel its performance , which it did they could have gone on it was n't that the plaza was going to be so crowded that people could n't get into the state theater but going on did n't seem to fit the tenor of the moment 'a sense of shock' city opera also lost several rehearsals , said paul kellogg , the company s general and artistic director , and when the rehearsals resumed , the singers were still traumatized this is a deeply professional company , mr kellogg said , but there was a sense of shock that left people so affected that the will to proceed was momentarily shaken people got over that , and realized that we have something here that s useful to do , and they got right into it again the new york philharmonic had different reasons to fret although the orchestra s season was not scheduled to open until sept 20 , the philharmonic had just completed a european tour , and on sept 11 , the players were at the frankfurt airport in germany waiting to come home when all flights were canceled the nearest hotels that could accommodate the more than 100 musicians were in stuttgart , more than two hours away by the time the players returned to new york , on sept 15 , the start of the season had been transformed annesophie mutter , the german violinist , who was to have played the beethoven violin concerto on opening night , had decided not to travel and in any case , kurt masur , the orchestra s music director , and zarin mehta , its executive director , had decided to replace the opening night franck and beethoven program with a memorial performance of the brahms german requiem , with the proceeds about 300 , 000 to be donated to a world trade center relief fund putting this memorial together was so straightforward and easy , mr mehta said the orchestra immediately said , 'of course , we have to do it' the first two singers i asked , thomas hampson and heidi grant murphy , said yes , and when i talked to kurt masur about what to play , there was maybe three seconds of discussion by saturday , the choir already had its first rehearsal and then , getting 'live from lincoln center' and the whole pbs network together to broadcast a 90minute program it all fell into place i 've experienced a surge of friendship and cooperation , and i hope we can continue to be nice to each other for a long time smaller organizations were affected as well on the day of the attack , merkin concert hall was about to open its tuesday matinee series with an early afternoon performance by concertante , a young chamber orchestra i was on my way downstairs , and i saw people huddled around the radio , said vickie margulies , the director of concert programs at the hall , but i did n't know what was going on
i know a horse trainer who says that if you could just carry square one with you , you 'd never have to go back to square one i heard that at a county fairground in eastern wyoming , but it came back to me on park avenue yesterday i was standing in the median crosswalk north of 63rd street and there , in a small raised plot , were the first two tulips i 've seen blooming this spring they are a species of tulip called tulipa schrenkii , discovered by europeans in 1585 but native , as the tulip historian anna pavord writes , to the steppes and low mountains of crimea and transcaucasia their presence this spring on park avenue indicates the growing importance of gardening with heirloom and antique plants the botanical equivalent of carrying square one with you t schrenkii is not a dominating tulip it has none of the height , none of the stiffness or prominence of the hybrid tulips that surround it , and which are still only in leaf but t schrenkii may be one of the important progenitors of the familiar monochromatic tulips that in another week or two will display a certain unanimity all over the city by comparison , t schrenkii seems almost to crouch , to withdraw it lacks the foghorn colors of modern tulips its sharptipped petals , winedark but edged with yellow , resemble deep , subtle flames , and it looks as though it were meant to cover entire hillsides , not to compete with the overpowering effects of park avenue but back to square one the variations that humans have wrought upon domesticated plants and animals are almost infinite inevitably , as time passes and fashions change , the origins that lie behind those variations grow dim and often forgotten , as do earlier variations themselves just as there is a necrology of longgone buildings , so there is a necrology a substantial one of plant varieties and animal breeds that have been sacrificed as values and tastes have changed with luck , the current fashion for heirloom and antique plants , embodied by t schrenkii , will turn out not to be fashion at all , but a continuing expression of the need for genetic conservation , for keeping the past alive in the most literal sense possible verlyn klinkenborg
honolulu , march 19 the petty officer on the nuclear attack submarine greeneville charged with tracking nearby vessels testified today that the ship s sonars showed several times that the japanese trawler ehime maru was within close range before they collided but he said that he failed to notice all the readings , and that he did not notify the submarine s captain even when there was evidence of a problem the witness , petty officer first class patrick t seacrest , was the socalled fire control technician when his submarine surfaced abruptly off hawaii on feb 9 and rammed the ehime maru , sinking it nine people were lost in the accident petty officer seacrest never fully explained his fatal lapse in not providing the critical information , and if anything , his testimony made it more inexplicable at one point , he said , he was focused on tracking a ship that had just been picked up by the sonar and so missed signs that the ehime maru was getting perilously near the greeneville he also said that when the ship s computers showed the japanese vessel closing in , at about 2 , 000 yards , he assumed they were wrong , because the greeneville s captain had checked through the periscope several times and not seen the vessel so , he testified , he manually programmed the computer to show the ehime maru out of range because of the lack of a sighting that s not a proper procedure , is it \? asked the lawyer for cmdr scott d waddle , charles w gittins petty officer seacrest replied , no , it s not written down anywhere his testimony came in what appeared be the final phase of the court of inquiry s investigation into the collision lawyers for commander waddle will decide on tuesday whether he will testify two of the three senior officers who are the targets of the inquiry offered limited testimony today lt jg michael j coen , the greeneville s officer of the deck the day of the accident , offered unsworn testimony , which meant that he could not be crossexamined by the navy he offered an apology and pleaded to be allowed to continue his navy service , but offered no details of what happened on the submarine that day i want you to know that you are in my thoughts and prayers at all times , lieutenant coen said to family members of the ehime maru s crew who were present and you will be for the rest of my life lawyers for the other officer , lt cmdr gerald k pfeifer , the ship s second in command , submitted a written statement to the court that was not made public but this morning commander waddle broke his silence and told reporters in front of the court that if he did testify , he would take responsibility for the accident the first word i will say to the court will be that fact that i'm accountable and i'm responsible for the accident that led to the tragic collision and sinking of the ehime maru , commander waddle said none of my crew members should be accountable or responsible for that accident petty officer seacrest indicated that the submarine rushed through some of its safety procedures , like a visual check of the area through its periscope , before it shot to the surface in a drill that was conducted largely for the benefit of 16 civilian guests aboard the submarine the captain took just 80 seconds for those checks , at two levels , rather than the norm , about three minutes but petty officer seacrest also said he was not overburdened , tracking just three ships in the area an earlier investigation by the navy had determined that petty officer seacrest was slightly hampered in his work of tracking nearby vessels by the presence of civilians in the control room that day but petty officer seacrest plainly contradicted that earlier assessment today , saying that if he had noticed the ehime maru s close range earlier he could have notified the captain easily he was granted immunity for his testimony today , which means it cannot be used against him later in a military court petty officer seacrest seemed to take responsibility for the accident , but the lapses that caused the disaster still seemed hard to comprehend , even to some of the senior navy officers involved in the court of inquiry here one of the more puzzling portions of the sailor s testimony came when he repeated that the captain and two most senior officers on the ship were not just competent but highly qualified , and yet they failed to even notice that petty officer seacrest , who was so trusted that he was an official career counselor to junior crewmen , was not plotting by hand the coordinates of nearby vessels on the paper wall chart in response to questioning by mr gittins , petty officer seacrest said the top officers maintained the highest standards on board the greeneville and for whatever reason that day you chose not to maintain that standard \? mr gittins asked that is correct , petty officer seacrest responded capt bruce macdonald , the counsel for the court of inquiry , at one point asked pointedly , you got lazy , did n't you , petty officer seacrest \? petty officer seacrest replied yes , sir a little bit petty officer seacrest said that while the submarine was preparing check the area with its periscope , the captain had told him he had a good feel for the contact picture in one confusing moment , captain macdonald noted that petty officer seacrest had manually moved the ehime maru s position from roughly 2 , 000 yards away to more than 9 , 000 yards only after the collision , according to the submarine s computer records petty officer seacrest insisted , however , that he recalled taking that step before the collision his testimony came on what may have been the last day in which officers will provide sworn testimony in this phase of the navy s inquiry earlier today , the head of the inquiry , adm thomas b fargo , announced that he decided to refuse a request by commander waddle for immunity mr gittins had said earlier that commander waddle would exercise his right to refuse to testify unless he received the grant once this inquiry concludes , perhaps on tuesday , the three admirals presiding over it will provide recommendations on what actions the navy should take against the three officers admiral fargo will then have 30 days to issue a final decision as fire control technician , petty officer seacrest takes sonar data and plots it on computers and on a paper map nearby to provide a clear picture of all vessels in the vicinity he admitted that he failed to update the paper chart with accurate data he said that as the captain prepared to raise the submarine up high enough to scan the area through the periscope , he had not noticed that the ehime maru had closed in , from 15 , 000 yards to 4 , 000 yards , because he was focused on another ship that had just been detected by the sonar photo petty officer first class patrick t seacrest leaving the court of inquiry yesterday after testifying \( associated press \) \( pg a17 \)
moscow , nov 10 days before a muchanticipated meeting with president bush , president vladimir v putin called tonight for russia and the united states to bury the vestiges of their cold war suspicions and form an alliance with a qualitatively new level of trust underscoring that , he said emphatically that russia did not regard the mushrooming role of the united states in central asia , the heartland of the former soviet union , as either a strategic or an economic threat while he offered no details , mr putin also said he was very optimistic that the two nations would eventually strike a deal to rewrite the 30yearold rules of nucleararms control fundamentally in a broadranging interview with american journalists in the kremlin s presidential library , mr putin clearly intended to set a high tone for his american visit , which includes a twoday stopover at mr bush s ranch in texas next week he said several times that he felt not only that he and mr bush had established a close personal relationship , but also that the sept 11 terrorist attacks on the united states had given their nations a common cause and the seeds of a lasting alliance we would like our joint struggle against terrorism to lead to positive results , that terrorism not only in afghanistan but the entire world be destroyed , uprooted , liquidated , mr putin said only a coordinated strategy will allow civilized nations to respond quickly and adequately to what promises to be a long campaign against terrorists , he said it is quite obvious to any objective observer , he said , that we can find an effective response to these challenges only if we pull our efforts together beyond that , mr putin said both nations must shed the fears of the past linked to their cold war rivalry , and accept that they now share not only democratic values and ambitions , but also the same commitment to market economics americans who think otherwise , he said , simply do not understand the way the world has changed perhaps his most striking example was russia s new attitude in the former soviet nations of central asia , where the growing american military presence has convinced many russian military officials and private experts that washington wants to push moscow out of its historic sphere of influence mr putin rejected that argument as an example of cold war thinking that automatically pits the united states and russia as rivals in fact , he said , their common cause against terrorism and their increasing cooperation in developing oil fields in the area make clear that they have common interests what was important in the former system of coordinates and the former reference framework now is losing its importance , he said if russia is now becoming a fullfledged member of the international community , then we must not fear , and we will not fear , the development of relations between its neighbors and other countries and nations the times have long gone when russia viewed the world as needing a confrontational approach , he said we are not for this we are quite the opposite now he also called for russia and the united states to move toward settlements on other issues that have divided them , led by the yearlong standoff over washington s plans to build a limited national missile defense he said russia was prepared to negotiate changes in the 1972 antiballistic missile treaty , which prohibits national defenses against missiles , when we see specific options from american experts , something he said had yet to occur it will be up to the political leaders to make a choice between different options , and i am very optimistic that they can be found , he said mr putin reiterated russia s opposition to a proposal that would expand the nato alliance to include three baltic nations lithuania , latvia and estonia , which once were part of the soviet union but at the same time , he suggested that a shift of nato s mission away from the purely defensive alliance that once opposed soviet force , and toward a group that combats international terrorism and weapons proliferation , could rekindle the nature of the alliance russia could offer a great deal to such an organization , he said i can tell you frankly that i have certain ideas of a general nature , he said i ca n't elaborate on them now , but they are very promising asked tonight whether he believed a claim by osama bin laden that the qaeda organization possesses nuclear and chemical weapons , mr putin said such statements were generally made in an attempt to sow panic he said he was certain that none of russia s weapons of mass destruction had fallen into terrorist hands
tampa , fla , jan 27 bill parcells is a name that inspires passion there are many who love him , and there are some who despise him , but it always seemed that everyone who came in contact with parcells respected his ability as a football man he was always projected as a cinch for the hall of fame then came the day , early today , when the 38member pro football hall of fame committee met to discuss the 15 candidates when it came time to talk about parcells , the temperature in the room rose dramatically there was that passion again parcells s detractors felt that , despite his denials about never coaching again , he would probably indeed return to the sidelines , and that voting him in now , knowing that parcells often says one thing and does another , would be a travesty the rule is a coach must be retired , and though parcells is , there was a feeling he would stay retired only to be elected , and then return to a lucrative coaching position the supporters of parcells said , first , they believed he would not coach again , and second , it did n't matter , because a great coach is a great coach period in the end , in one of the more bizarre moments in what can be at times a bizarre voting process , parcells did not make the first cut when the list of nominees was trimmed to 10 one of the greatest coaches ever was treated like a thirdstring tight end trying to make the training camp roster of the cincinnati bengals that part , at least , is a travesty but parcells has no one to blame but himself for much of his impressive 15year nfl coaching career , parcells has intimidated , cajoled and , yes , even lied his way from one job to another , with each move eroding his once untouchable credibility he has become slicker than a used car salesman at closing , and so , no one can believe him when he says he will not coach again in his dealings with the news media , he has intimidated , cajoled , and yes , even lied to reporters do n't think for a second that did not enter into the equation with some voters , as several confirmed after the process was complete there is little question that a few remember times when parcells publicly embarrassed them , and this was a way to get back at him that such a stellar football talent does not even make the first cut is not an indictment of parcells the coach , but parcells the person one voter gave the example of the former buffalo coach marv levy levy went to four super bowls but lost them all parcells went to three with two different teams , and won two on the surface , how levy gets in , and parcells does not , seems to make no sense but one writer said he voted for levy over parcells because levy was a good person who did n't treat you like a piece of dirt the way parcells did to me , things like that count another voter said the maximum amount of people that can enter the hall of fame in any one year is seven this year , seven made it do you really believe that bill parcells is not good enough to be among that final seven \? of course he is so what it came down to was credibility , and to a lot of people , parcells has none i know i expect him to soon be coaching again in one sense , the notion of making parcells wait because of the possibility that he might return to coaching is unfair , and there is precedent for a situation like this in 1963 , george halas was inducted into the hall of fame , then came out of retirement to coach chicago paul brown was fired in cleveland , voted in , and returned to coach , and own , the bengals bill walsh made the hall , and then returned as general manager of the san francisco 49ers the difference between walsh and parcells is that there were not rumors leading to the hall voting that walsh was going to coach again and walsh , as a head coach , never tried contemptible powerplay games the way parcells did behind the scenes with the giants , the new england patriots and the jets and parcells s personality also did not help his case some of the voters simply dislike him because he certainly has not treated the news media with respect as the hall of fame voter paul zimmerman , who favored parcells s entry into the hall , wrote before the vote in his internet column for cnn si , it will be pointed out that he made our lives tougher , that he started the reprehensible practice of declaring his assistant coaches off limits to the press , that he lied a lot zimmerman added , i know that there will be a few selectors who will utter no word for or against him but will withhold their vote as a payback there is nothing worse than a member of the news media scorned the longrunning argument with this process has been how much does character count \? should a person s flaws be part of the equation \? should parcells s believability be an issue \? it should , and it was photo bill parcells does have the coaching credentials \( barton silverman the new york times \)
they arrived at madison square garden with none of the aura and fanfare of defending conference champions without mark jackson , dale davis and rik smits , the indiana pacers , dreaded foes for so much of the past decade , were just another team yesterday , one whose youth and mediocre record made them unlikely conquerors of the recently dominant knicks but the pacers proved they were still capable of spoiling a basketball experience for the knicks and their fans the familiar antagonists jalen rose , reggie miller and travis best combined with the youngsters al harrington and jermaine o'neal to pummel the knicks for the entire 48 minutes the pacers led for all but four minutes in winning , 8774 , and halted the knicks' winning streak at three games whether it was indiana s new and unsung identity or the odd noon tipoff , the knicks \( 2514 \) were lethargic and with marcus camby serving the second game of his fivegame suspension , they had no chance of overcoming their spiritless play i think that was just a lack of energy on our part , said allan houston , who scored just 12 points on 3of13 shooting i know it s an early game , but you have to kick yourself out of it eventually , and i know i did n't i settled for jump shots i need some honey or something rose too much for houston , latrell sprewell or erick strickland to handle scored 24 points , including 20 in the second half , on 10of14 shooting with best and miller each adding 16 points , the pacers \( 2021 \) shot 465 percent to become the first knicks opponent to shoot better than 46 percent since philadelphia reached 57 percent on opening night no team had shot 43 percent against the knicks since nov 17 , a span of 28 games the knicks' woeful effort ruined an outstanding performance by kurt thomas , who had 14 points and a careerhigh 18 rebounds , including 11 on the offensive end larry johnson \( 22 points \) and sprewell \( 18 points \) also played well offensively , but the knicks shot just 36 percent over all i would say it was the best we have played all season , said isiah thomas , indiana s firstyear coach we put together a complete game offensively and defensively the knicks said that their inability to penetrate the pacers' defense stemmed from missing open shots but indiana stifled them brendan malone , who ended a fouryear stint as a knicks assistant by joining indiana this season , had schooled the pacers on the knicks' offense , and their attentiveness was evident he might have overcoached us coming into this game , miller said he knew every personnel , which way they liked to turn , and how many times they turned that way it was almost to the point where it was getting sick but that s what you need you never know , we might see them in the playoffs the pacers , who had lost their previous three regularseason games at the garden , did not look like a postseason team earlier this season but isiah thomas seems to have them coming together , particularly on defense they have won 7 of their last 10 games and have held seven of their last eight opponents to less than 40 percent shooting their lineup , once slow and plodding , is now replete with long , wiry types who plant their hands in the passing lanes and impair views of the basket rose guarded charlie ward and used his seveninch height advantage to make simple entry passes difficult , and that put the knicks in an early hole after kurt thomas got the knicks off on a pleasant note by hitting a jumper and rejecting o'neal s first shot , the knicks went 12 minutes 22 seconds without getting a point from anyone but sprewell with sprewell practically playing oneonfive by no fault of his own the knicks fell behind , 2312 , at the end of the first quarter he made 5 of 8 shots in scoring 10 points , while the rest of the knicks went 1 for 10 they also committed five turnovers in the period we just came out flat , sprewell said we were n't as aggressive we settled for jump shots instead of going hard and taking it to the basket that s what we try to force teams to do , but they got us doing that instead the knicks trailed by 4633 at halftime , leading coach jeff van gundy to change his lineup at the start of the third quarter , something he rarely does he replaced ward with strickland , and the knicks eventually pulled within 6 points but rose and best kept them from getting any closer rose scored the pacers' first 11 points of the quarter and stymied a knick run by scoring a layup while houston fouled him rose s 3point play put the pacers up by 9 , and the knicks never got closer than 7 points again twice in the third , best increased the margin to 9 points with baskets that resulted from his unmatched quickness in the fourth quarter , rose hit two 3pointers , including a 27foot heave he tossed up awkwardly to beat the shot clock that s one of those shots , when you say , 'he s got it going right now , ' sprewell said it was all net , and he just picked it up and let it go jalen s an excellent player we all know that from playing him last year and seeing what he s capable of doing now , the knicks and their faithful know what the newfangled pacers are capable of doing photos the knicks' allan houston , who finished with 12 points , tangled with the pacers' derrick mckey \( barton silverman the new york times \) \( pg d1 \) the

in a state where sporting loyalties sometimes are split between new york and boston , the one thing that most fans agree upon is their support of the university of connecticut and its major athletic programs the fan enthusiasm has been rewarded with national collegiate athletic association titles four times in the last five years with the 1999 men s basketball championship , the 1995 and 2000 women s basketball titles and most recently with the men s soccer championship in 2000 the next great goal for the uconn huskies is to be competitive in division i football two major steps were taken as the millennium began on the road to contention in football first with the program upgrade from ncaa division iaa to ia and then with the state legislature s approval of 90 million for rentschler field , a 40 , 000seat stadium now being built in east hartford as a homefield replacement for memorial stadium and its 16 , 000 seats in storrs uconn coach randy edsall , hired in 1998 , has quickly moved to upgrade the huskies football program by trying to keep some of the state s best players in connecticut he has successfully recruited one of the nation s top football players , quarterback dan orlovsky of shelton high school , the unbeaten champion of connecticut s largest division , class ll of the connecticut interscholastic athletic conference shelton high finished the 2000 season with a 120 record when it beat greenwich , 228 , in december over the course of his high school career , orlovsky completed 341 of 559 passes for 5 , 265 yards and 51 touchdowns his senior year performance \( 2 , 385 passing yards and 24 touchdown passes , 5 interceptions \) earned him recognition as the state s gatorade player of the year under ncaa rules , schools cannot discuss their recruiting until after the deadline for players signing a national letter of intent , which for the justcompleted football season is feb 7 orlovsky was rated in the preseason as one of the top25 high school quarterbacks in the nation by one scouting report and has been recruited by such major football programs as michigan state , purdue , virginia , virginia and northwestern the 6foot5inch , 213pound orlovsky surprised many when he gave connecticut his early oral commitment to play in storrs he said connecticut s coaching staff indicated that he would likely not play during his freshman season , instead focusing on learning the uconn system of plays and working on his physical strength it would also allow edsall and his staff to recruit other top players to team with orlovsky in time for the huskies' debut at rentschler field on aug 30 , 2003 , against rutgers orlovsky s high school coach , joseph benanto , said the young quarterback had indicated that connecticut was among his top choices dan likes a challenge and while he s never said this to me , i think he likes the idea of uconn putting on his shoulders that they are going division ia with him , said benanto i think he looks at the situation and says , 'hey , jump on my shoulders and let s see what happens' at 17 , orlovsky is confident and mature when talking about his future that was one of the turning points in my decision , to be part of the foundation for the program , he said it 'll be tough not playing because i 've been playing nine straight years , starting with pop warner but i know what my role is next year , to get used to the system and get stronger that s how it goes benanto , a former baseball and freshman football coach at yale who now has coached shelton high to two state titles in seven years , believes that orlovsky has the ability to succeed in college because he is a hard worker he noted that while many young players look for ways to avoid individual workouts and studying films to prepare for games , orlovsky faithfully puts in his time without complaint as an example , he noted that during the recently completed season the coaching staff decided to see how many times orlovsky passed the ball during the four days of regular practice sessions , from monday through thursday they found he threw the ball 1 , 200 times none of us are good enough to say a kid is definitely going to make it because we do n't know what s going to happen , benanto said but i do know one thing the kids who work hard have a much better chance than those kids who come out of high school and are stars and have not really worked hard the coach said his quarterback really is a student of the game , who devoted many hours to looking at his next opponent s game films his example led others on the team to also put in extra time watching films , which helped the team to reach its goal of the state championship orlovsky credits his father , also named dan , for providing the encouragement and support that helped him work harder to improve himself the elder orlovsky , a former defensive tackle at the university of bridgeport when it was a small college football power in the early 1970 s , also coached football at shelton high school before his son played there i'm glad he feels that way because i think there were times when i bordered on being the overbearing parent , said his father , who is a certified financial planner i would challenge him to work hard by saying 'you know , your competition is working hard today if you take the day off , he s a day up on you' i think he s looking forward to being the starter at uconn as soon as he is capable of being it what i keep telling him is that there are going to be some other quarterbacks who will have something to say about that until his second year in high school , orlovsky considered himself a more promising shortstop and pitcher in baseball however , he made the decision to quit baseball and concentrate on football i liked the competition , playing under the lights on friday night , he said you 're actually playing for the love of the game instead of just playing for money like the pros not that orlovsky would rule out one day playing for pay on sunday in the national football league his longterm goal is to stay involved in sports as a broadcaster with the espn sports cable network , based in bristol , but if there is the opportunity to play as a professional , he will take it since winning the state championship , orlovsky has been enjoying the wide recognition of his achievements , but he is also quick to point out that he was part of a team effort i take it all as fun , orlovsky said i think it s a great honor for people to be asking for your autograph and wanting to be like you i do n't understand why you would n't want that just the other day a father came up to ask me if i 'd work with his son who plays pop warner i said , of course anything that s going to help the football team

friday s jump in unemployment sent wall street into a tailspin , but it should n't have come as a big surprise the us economy may or may not be technically in recession , but it is certainly growing much more slowly than its potential this output gap was bound to show up in higher unemployment more significant was the fact that the bad news on jobs followed bad news about consumer spending the muchballyhooed tax rebate , it seems , is n't having much impact so much for cheery forecasts of imminent recovery now what \? first , do n't give up on monetary policy the slump during the first bush administration dragged on much longer than anyone expected , even as the fed kept cutting but in the end rate , cuts did do the trick i would n't be surprised if the fed s funds rate goes to 2 or lower before we really see a turnaround , but the odds are still that rate cuts will eventually work what about fiscal policy \? some liberals have recently made common cause with the bush administration , arguing that the economic slump is a reason to put aside promises to protect the social security surplus but those liberals are making a big mistake even on the straight economics of the case , it is by no means clear what good it would do to give up on protecting social security by and large , the spending decisions that congress will make over the next few months wo n't have much impact on the economy until late next year at the earliest even pessimistic analysts think that a recovery will already be under way by then furthermore , responsible behavior can be rewarded and irresponsible behavior punished quite quickly in 1993 , in the face of a stillsluggish economy , robert rubin and larry summers urged bill clinton to commit himself to fiscal discipline such a commitment , they argued , would help keep longterm interest rates down and would do more to stimulate the economy , even in the short run , than any attempt to pump it up with deficit spending and they were vindicated by events so even an administration that is sincerely trying to fight an economic slowdown should be held to its fiscal promises and when an administration is n't sincere about its motives , it s even more important to hold it accountable those are strong words , but george w bush has a consistent pattern he does n't respond to events by changing his policies he merely uses those events to justify his original agenda one need only point to the way he used a shortterm economic slowdown to push through a longrun tax cut almost identical to the one he proposed back in november 1999 given that the bush tax cut was n't designed to fight a recession , it s no surprise that it is n't working the only part of the tax cut that does anything for the economy this year is the rebate added to the plan at the insistence of democrats and the rebate is less than 2 percent of the 10year total even if consumers spent it all \( and it s already clear they wo n't \) , the rebate would hardly make a dent in the unemployment rate meanwhile , the tax cut will cost the treasury at least 2 trillion after 2004 that is , after the economy will supposedly have recovered that does little or nothing to fuel current consumer spending but as mr rubin and mr summers could have told you , the prospect of longrun fiscal irresponsibility keeps longterm interest rates high in other words , the bush tax cut , aside from its devastating impact on longrun budget prospects , is also a shortrun drag on the economy is there any reason to suppose that mr bush , if he is allowed to get away with breaking his promises on social security , will use his freedom of action to any better effect \? none at all in fact , during his brief press conference after the unemployment numbers came out , mr bush did it again now that the excuse of a supposed energy crisis has evaporated , he tried to sell dick cheney s energy plan the one that wo n't produce any oil for at least a decade as part of his plan to fight the current slowdown so to those who think that mr bush should be released from his promises because of the weak economy think again mr bush wo n't use his freedom to good effect he will simply use it and you to do more harm

west yarmouth , mass i never believed that i could be in danger on a golf course until i was struck by lightning on one last year what i learned that spring day is that lightning is an underrated killer that fries minds and turns bodies into charred shells i was playing in a charity golf tournament on cape cod the sky was clear when our foursome joined in a shotgun start players on every hole teeing off at the same time my group was just finishing at the 10th hole when a horn , the signal for a storm threat , began blaring we rushed toward our carts , heading for the clubhouse , but we were still far out on the course when i was struck my life changed in seconds i understand the strike had a halo effect the other players heard a loud bang and saw me stumble to the ground they say smoke came from my body the charge hit my head and lower body and then exited through my feet my shoes flew off for a long 10 minutes , my golfing partners performed cpr , forcing life into me at one point my friends thought i was dead i had stopped breathing i died a second time in the ambulance i remember none of this a few days later i woke up in intensive care , but i did n't recover my memory for more than a month now , more than a year later , i am still working at rehabilitation from the physical disabilities i was left with it is our cultural habit not to take lightning seriously winning the lottery jackpot or finding the perfect husband is said to be about as likely as getting struck by lightning which is meant to convey that there s virtually no chance at all most americans consider thunderstorms minor , if dramatic , inconveniences traffic keeps moving and outdoor games go on , despite the thunder , until pelting rain arrives but while my experience may not be common , it s not freakish , either and i invite casual risk takers to consider its severity over the past 30 years , an average of 73 people a year have been killed by lightning in the united states , according to the national weather service , and about 300 are struck each year and survive since victims of lightning do n't die from burns , but from cardiac arrest , it was my good fortune that one of my golfing buddies had just completed a refresher course in cpr but still my body was profoundly shocked and my brain was damaged and this is typical at 49 , i am relearning basic motor skills how to eat , shave , dress , walk down a hall without bumping into walls i ca n't toss my little girl in the air sometimes the pain in my damaged nerves is intense i do n't like the effect on my family the people i most love are now caregivers insurers have told me that i will probably continue to need medical care when i applied for longterm disability insurance , i received a letter stating i had been turned down due to your medical history of lightning strike there are organized efforts to warn people about lightning the national oceanic and atmospheric administration issues alerts and disseminates the relevant advice go indoors at the first rumbling of thunder stay clear of trees , water , wire objects and heavy equipment do n't use the telephone during a storm the pga tour requires that a meteorologist be present at every event , to stop play when there s danger of lightning yet i suspect most people are still as unaware of this particular danger as i used to be more americans are killed by lightning each year than by hurricanes or tornadoes and many more than are killed by sharks you 'd never know this , however , from news coverage or even from popular lore perhaps it is only natural that the press concentrates on dangers that threaten many people at once , and that stories are told and retold of events with many witnesses deaths and injuries from lightning are isolated and farflung easy to overlook or ignore unless , of course , you have been a victim drawings \( ren e french \)

east rutherford , nj , dec 4 one game after one of their best performances of the season , against the best team in the league , the devils managed only one goal tonight against tampa bay , one of the worst teams in the league no wonder lou lamoriello , the president and general manager of the devils , is looking for a scorer to fill the void left by the departure of alexander mogilny , who scored 43 goals last season bobby holik got the devils' only goal tonight as they outshot tampa bay , 4211 , but could only muster a 11 tie before a crowd of 12 , 002 , the smallest this season at continental arena the tie left the devils with just two victories in their last 12 games and in last place in the atlantic division at 101032 they devils , who beat the detroit red wings by 41 last saturday , have outshot their opponents in the last nine games , so tonight s effort against nikolai khabibulin was nothing unusual it just reinforced the notion that the devils need another established scorer someone like vincent lecavalier of the lightning , who has had disagreements with john tortorella , the tampa bay coach the problem for the devils is that lecavalier is sought by several other teams , and they might not be willing to give up what tampa bay wants when lamoriello was asked to comment tonight on trade talk surrounding lecavalier and jason arnott , the center of the devils' first line , he stood fast i 'll continue my policy of not discussing , denying or confirming anything about trades , lamoriello said just minutes before the opening faceoff he said he had spoken with rick dudley , the tampa bay general manager , during the board of governors' meeting earlier today in new york dudley s team has had problems scoring goals lately , too the lightning entered the game after having been shut out in consecutive losses to the rangers and the philadelphia flyers that streak was ended at 154 minutes 20 seconds , or 12 54 into tonight s second period fredrik modin ended it with his seventh goal of the season after a centering pass from the left side by martin st louis hit modin s skate and went in past martin brodeur the devils had a wonderful opportunity to tie the game 3 50 into the third period , but arnott s shot from the slot hit the left post and bounced away khabibulin was not as lucky with 8 33 left in the period holik stepped into the crease and deflected in a shot brian rafalski took from the blue line the goal , holik s 10th of the season , came on the devils' 35th shot of the game and with tampa bay s nolan pratt in the penalty box for crosschecking randy mckay 38 seconds earlier he was very good , holik said of khabibulin , who was closing in on a clubrecordtying fifth shutout of the season , but what we have to do is be more selective with our shots it s not the quantity of shots , it s the quality addressing the lack of scoring by his team despite an overwhelming edge in shots , coach larry robinson said we 've had some bad luck in close games you need better luck we need to stand in front of the goal and we have to show perseverance slap shots coach larry robinson said goalie martin brodeur would start in montreal on wednesday night he had only 11 shots , robinson said tampa bay took only seven shots in the first two periods and none in overtime
tampa , fla , jan 23 nearly an hour before media day began for the baltimore ravens today , reporters were carving out places in line to be part of the rush when the gates opened of all the hundreds of silly super bowl milestones , this had to be some kind of record for assembling at the gate everybody was angling for position for the push into raymond james stadium when the stockades finally opened , we stampeded in , a herd of cameras and microphones , pens and pads we rushed past jonathan ogden , the allpro offensive tackle , rushed past safety rod woodson and made a beeline for ray lewis , the middle linebacker lewis had not faced this many news media representatives since murder charges against him were dropped last june on super bowl night 2000 in atlanta , two men were murdered lewis was implicated and charged since then , lewis has led the ravens to the american football conference championship and super bowl xxxv against the giants his reward was having to dredge up the case in some ways , lewis was being tried in a news media courtroom on monday , ravens coach brian billick , reacting to an article about the murder victims' families , went into a tirade media day would be the only day lewis would talk about the case , billick said for good measure he called the assembled reporters ambulance chasers actually , reporters are more like bloodhounds , and today we thought we had the scent of something maybe confession maybe contrition i'm not here to please you , lewis said when someone suggested that he talk about the case so reporters would leave him alone so you do n't even have to go away you can say what you want to say , you can write what you want to write i'm not going to speak about it then lewis spoke about it in between talking about sunday s game , the giants and playing near his lakeland home , he spoke about an ordeal that tainted his reputation and nearly ended his career what i went through , you ca n't get me to think about or talk about , he said at another point yes , we 're human , we 're going to sometime go back to it , but that s on my time lewis blasted the prosecutor in atlanta , saying he was singled out because of his stature as a top national football league player he mentioned being young and black and wealthy , but stopped short of saying the lingering attention was racially motivated if i'm an average joe , none of you all are here , lewis said now that s how really simple it is but lewis is not an average joe the ravens' owner , art modell , may not have interceded for an average joe lewis would n't have the many endorsement contracts he said he had signed this season if he were just an average joe lewis reminded us time and again that he was here to talk football , only to go into streamofconsciousness statements traced with anger and frustration i'm just like everybody else , he said i'm a man i bleed i cry i moan i do all of that so you just move on in life lewis scoffed at the notion that today s grilling by reporters was pressure people say , 'how s he going to handle this , how s he going to handle that \? ' he said what do i have to handle \? all i have to handle is tiki barber and ron dayne on sunday everything else is irrelevant but there were hecklers in the crowd some apparently wanted contrition lewis s use of irrelevant irked one reporter , who made a gigantic leap you say everything is irrelevant you 're not saying an unsolved double murder is irrelevant \? lewis shot back you write what you write quote me what i say , but do n't put words in my mouth reporter you said all that matters is tiki barber and ron dayne lewis come sunday , that s all that matters that s all i'm here for lewis could have been charming he could have been like giants quarterback kerry collins , who was full of contrition on monday collins all but threw himself on the altar and testified we tend to like that lewis could have charmed us he could have said look i'm sorry this happened , sorry two people lost their lives i feel for the family of the dead he did n't not to us , not today he refused to yield refused to give the throng what it wanted i'm not sure the herd knew what it wanted ray , would you like to say something to the families \? someone asked lewis was silent someone else shouted out ray , you were at the scene of the crime who were the real killers \? lewis i do n't know why did n't you tell the da \? lewis if i knew , i would have told them someone else asked lewis if he thought this line of questioning would ever end naw , he said they 're going to keep going but they 're not going to get what they think they 're going to get whatever lewis said , whatever he says , wo n't be enough for us bloodhounds there is this sense that he got away with something , added to a sense that all elite athletes are getting away with something in any event , billick and lewis have succeeded in putting the ravens back in an usagainstthem mode they are the betting favorites and the psychological underdogs , if not the purple villains if the ravens are as prepared for the giants as lewis was prepared for the news media today , big blue could be in trouble as for the reporters , the herd had accomplished about as much as any other offense had accomplished against lewis and the ravens a net gain of perhaps 17 yards as the interview session wound down , a few of lewis s teammates , who had been watching him , counted down five four three two one the horn sounded and lewis hopped down from the podium for the afternoon , the middle linebacker had become a defenseman he had effectively skated out a 60minute penalty photo there were dozens of other players to interview yesterday , but ray lewis was the center of attention on media day i'm just like everybody else , lewis said i'm a man i bleed i cry i moan i do all of that \( barton silverman the new york times \)
washington , aug 14 nearly two weeks ago , on the day the senate unanimously confirmed robert s mueller iii as the new director of the federal bureau of investigation , he was in an operating room in san francisco where surgeons removed his cancerous prostate gland his urologist and surgeon , dr peter r carroll , discussed mr mueller s cancer , his operation and his prognosis in a detailed interview with a reporter for the new york times , who is also a physician dr carroll said mr mueller has a very high likelihood of cancer cure , is in excellent physical and mental health , and is fit to serve the 10year term as fbi director the timing of the 2 1 2hour operation and the confirmation vote on aug 2 was a coincidence mr mueller , who learned that he had prostate cancer last fall and was told he could wait for treatment , had scheduled the surgery this summer , said dr carroll , who is the chief of urology at the university of california at san francisco mr mueller , 56 , had postponed his swearingin pending the outcome of the operation and the pathology report he did not want to assume his new position until he had recuperated and was ready to perform his duties fully , his associates said the pathology tests showed that the cancer was confined to a small area of the prostate , and mr mueller \( pronounced muller \) needs no additional therapy , dr carroll said this year , 198 , 100 cases of prostate cancer will be detected among americans and 31 , 500 will die from it , the american cancer society says statistically , an american man has a 16 percent chance of developing prostate cancer during his lifetime and a 34 percent chance of dying from it four days after his operation , mr mueller was at work , part time , preparing to leave his job as the united states attorney in san francisco most men do not return to vigorous work for about four weeks after the surgery , although many return to more sedentary work sooner but if you have a highly motivated man , it is hard to keep him from going back to work , dr carroll said mr mueller will determine for himself when he can start work , dr carroll added except for skin cancer , prostate cancer is the most commonly diagnosed type in men and their second leading cause of cancer death , behind lung cancer prostate cancer usually takes years to grow and spread , if it ever does mr mueller disclosed his cancer to administration officials before he was selected for the fbi post the senate judiciary committee received a letter dated june 20 from dr carroll affirming the diagnosis and giving a favorable prognosis but in the letter dr carroll did not provide the details that he did in recent interviews mr mueller declined to be interviewed about his health , but dr carroll spoke with his permission mr mueller s cancer was detected the way most such cancers are found today by a blood test in a checkup the blood test measures a protein known as psa , for prostate specific antigen the prostate produces it as part of the ejaculate to help sperm swim , but a small amount normally escapes into the blood mr mueller s prostate felt normal to all physicians who have examined him in washington and california since last september , dr carroll said but at that time his psa was slightly elevated at 55 nanograms per milliliter the number is usually less than 4 , although it can vary according to age , the laboratory performing the test , and other conditions like prostate inflammation but the test is not perfect its number can be elevated in the absence of cancer , and it can be normal when cancer is present also , the test cannot distinguish between cancers likely to be harmless and those that will kill to exclude a laboratory error , mr mueller s level was measured a second time again it was elevated so the doctors performed another test normally some antigen is bound to other proteins in the blood and some flows freely the more specific test measures the proportion of each the proportion that is bound tends to rise when cancer is present and the freeflowing portion tends to be higher when the patient has a noncancerous prostate enlargement thus , the lower the percentage of psa that is free , the stronger the likelihood of cancer in mr mueller s case , the free fraction was 8 percent , consistent with cancer in late fall , a urologist performed two biopsies of mr mueller s prostate the first showed that he had a small amount of prostate cancer that was confined to one area the second showed no evidence of cancer a magnetic resonance imaging test showed no evidence that the cancer had spread as the doctors continued to monitor the antigen level , it crept up , ranging from 55 to 77 , and the freefraction proportion stayed low some prostate cancers grow and spread rapidly many others grow slowly and never cause a problem but doctors have no way to know which patient has which form , and no single test provides an accurate diagnosis or prognosis however , doctors put much emphasis on what they call the gleason score to gauge the tumor s aggressiveness
los angeles , nov 3 harry potter has overcome a threeheaded dog , giant spiders and the evil lord voldemort but now he may finally have met his match warner brothers as warner brothers prepares for the release of harry potter and the sorcerer s stone at more than 3 , 500 north american theaters on nov 16 , it is tightly controlling and protecting his image not allowing him to drink soft drinks , for example as it walks a tightrope in the marketing of the movie and of the wizard himself on the one hand , the company wants to draw as much profit as possible from j k rowling s megabestselling stories and lay down a franchise for future movies and products that will feed corporate coffers for a decade but on the other , it worries about tainting the golden glow that surrounds the floppyhaired little wizard with too much hype and commercialism , alienating his fanatical fans we want to maximize this franchise in every way , said alan horn , the chairman of warner brothers , and that means we need also to make sure than the children and parents who love the stories do not feel that we have blown it even for a corporation as big and diversified as aol time warner , the studio s parent conglomerate , harry potter is a big deal it took two years and 120 million to bring the movie to life , but billions of dollars are lying tantalizingly on the horizon the danger is that if there is too much merchandising , parents might start to get somewhat cynical and say , 'gee , look at them overcommercializing it , ' said marty brochstein , executive editor of the licensing letter , a publication for the licensing industry that s the tightrope that everyone is walking here adults are apt to be especially wary of overcommercializing in harry s case because the first potter books seemed so notably free of it astonished and delighted parents found that their children those avatars of the video generation actually lined up at bookstores across the country the four books in print have sold some 116 million copies in 200 countries and 47 languages in recent interviews , warner brothers executives explained the steps the corporation has taken to make sure its fledgling franchise makes it to the end of the tightrope without falling it started , really , back in january of 2000 , when we kicked into planning for our consumer product line , said diane nelson , the studio s senior vice president for family entertainment , who is coordinating the arrival of the movie and its attendant products we developed a series of rules , our guiding principles the first guideline , she said , and the central one , was less is more in other words , do n't kill the goose by overhyping its golden egg do n't give parents or children any reason to loosen their embrace on the series at the same time , the executives did not want to homogenize away the qualities that made the series beloved harry and his friends are flawed and imperfect , one guideline says do n't sugarcoat them yet another guideline , and one that had a major effect on the merchandising campaigns , was , take people into harry s world , do n't put harry into our world in other words , ms nelson said , none of the advertising campaigns will include images of harry eating or drinking a specific product , or walking up to a fastfood counter nor will there be people dressed up in giant harry potter costumes at theme parks or shopping malls cocacola is a case in point major event movies often have three or more global licensing partners in this case , warner brothers decided to go with only coke , and it placed several conditions on the company we asked them not to put the kids or any of their faces on the cans and not to feature shots of harry drinking the soda , ms nelson said and we also asked them to include a philanthropic component there s this huge literacy program that s part of the coke campaign we think this goes to the spirit of what is inherent in the harry potter brand none of this is bad for cocacola , either , by the way but we really feel that the intention is about as altruistic as one gets in a corporate environment the studio was also more restrained than it has been with previous franchise properties about the number of licensees and the volume of products that will flood the market , executives said for the batman movie series , the studio had about 150 licensees for harry potter , there are 85 , including licensees for the movies and the book series dawn taubin , the studio s senior vice president for theatrical marketing , said the movie s publicity campaign was also mounted under the less is more precept central to the strategy was an effort to duplicate the gradual buildup of fan anticipation that greeted each of the books thus far , for the studio , the indications are good advance ticket sales have been at recordbreaking levels at moviefonecom and fandangocom , and several cinema chains intend to allow early ticket purchases to forestall the camping out at ticket booths that has greeted the openings of other blockbusters
americans' low math and science scores are well known on the 1999 international math and science survey , our eighth graders scored below their peers in almost every other industrial nation that took part students in japan and korea ranked near the top in math , average american eighth graders would have scored below the 25th percentile in japan or korea but the study also asked students if they liked math and science , thought it important and would want a job using these skills here , japanese and koreans scored at the very bottom only 9 percent of their eighth graders had positive attitudes toward math only 10 percent felt positively about science in the united states , 35 percent felt positively about math and 32 percent about science , more than in almost every other industrial nation for 20 years , americans have tried to remake schools , partly to be more like highscoring east asians a reagan administration report , a nation at risk , warned in 1983 that america would soon lose its competitive edge to countries with superior schools , like japan and korea since then , our graduation requirements have been raised , testing has been increased , with severe penalties for failure , and instructional time has grown meanwhile , schools in japan and korea have been trying to copy ours across east asia , leaders are trying to reform education so students will know fewer facts and spend less time preparing for tests but , like americans , be more willing to take risks and more creative in applying what they know the japanese and koreans also believe that economic survival demands education reform jaekyung lee , a university of maine professor who studies schools in his native korea , said korean employers realized that disciplined and highly skilled workers were not what they needed most instead , companies had to develop new products for new markets , and for that , workers unafraid to question authority or take initiative were essential a korean presidential commission in 1994 demanded reform , much like president ronald reagan s group a decade before the korean commission proposed a deemphasis of testing , more electives that depart from standardized curriculums and college admissions based more on recommendations and overall high school records than on standardized tests in japan , too , policy makers are trying to relax standards recently , the government required new textbooks to reduce content by 30 percent so study time could be cut to encourage nonacademic leisure and saturday school has been dropped officials hope that with less textbook material to cover , teachers will encourage more student inquiry and initiative teiichi sato , director of the japan society for the promotion of science and a former deputy minister of education , argues that the 21stcentury economy requires such reforms he says japanese education , emphasizing obedience and standards , is illsuited to help students adapt easily to the rapid change that characterizes the new economy japanese reform , mr sato said in a recent speech , should inspire zest for living , a trait he thinks characteristic of americans but not of his own students he defined it as development of abilities to uncover issues , to study and think alone , reach judgments independently and to act and solve problems well japanese officials , mr sato said , no longer attach great importance to students' high rankings on international tests because the exams measure skills valued by the old education system , not the new a zest for living cannot develop , he added , under the former style of education in which students simply acquired as much knowledge as possible in korea , as in the united states , the biggest bar to reform is poor teacher training dr lee said it was hard for koreans to teach differently from the way they were trained many only know how to dictate information for students to memorize teachers have not been equipped to show students how to question , try different ways of solving problems or make informed guesses about the unknown none of this means american school reform is misguided americans may have veered too far from high standards , just as east asians veered too far from developing the inquisitive boldness they now find lacking but it is also too mechanistic to conclude simply that the ideal is halfway between these extremes the apparently inverse relationship between these nations' rankings on skills and their rankings on love of math and science should certainly be a warning can american schools inch up the skills scale without sacrificing their place on the attitudinal scale \? nobody knows which may ultimately prove more important drawing \( david suter \)
what do these prominent professional athletes have in common chris evert , pete sampras , andre agassi , venus and serena williams , wayne gretzky , mario lemieux , eric lindros , alex rodriguez , ken griffey , manny ramirez and derek jeter \? none went to college the national basketball association is attempting to become the first professional sports league to ban players under age 20 such a restriction would not only be capricious , but also eminently unfair for many teenagers , college is necessary to pursue career goals but , as the above list of pro athletes demonstrates , not for all commissioner david stern contends that teenagers lack the physical and emotional maturity to play in the nba , and that their presence in the league contributes to the perception that the quality of play is declining yet with such outstanding players as allen iverson , vince carter , chris webber , jason kidd , stephon marbury and shaquille o'neal , the nba has never had a greater pool of young talent than it does today interestingly , each of these pros attended college for two years or less even more interesting , three of the league s brightest young stars kevin garnett , kobe bryant and tracy mcgrady were drafted straight out of high school at least a halfdozen other teenagers are now either making significant contributions or figure prominently in their teams' futures the nba s perspective on player marketability is equally disingenuous the commissioner says that the league s ability to market a player to the public and to advertisers is dramatically increased by the television exposure he receives during his college career this is patently untrue despite never having played a single ncaa game , garnett , bryant and mcgrady are among the most marketable players in all of professional sports even the marketing of the nba by nbc and tnt as well as corporate giants nike and adidas bears this out advertisements promoting the league focus almost exclusively on the young stars why then is the nba attempting to stigmatize teenage prodigies and indenture them to colleges and universities as unpaid professionals \? should these youngsters not be given a chance to make a living like the rest of us \? what if they are simply not academically motivated \? after all , declaring yourself eligible for the nba is a career choice , not a crime in fact , it has been argued that playing basketball in college only jeopardizes pro careers , which , for the most part , are staggeringly brief an nba career lasts , on average , barely five years randy livingston , a high school standout , seemed like a sure lottery pick but he bypassed the nba for louisiana state , sustained a serious leg injury and attracted only tepid interest to the league , livingston was damaged goods through fortitude and perseverance , he carved out a modest career in the nba , but he never earned anything close to what he would have had he turned pro out of high school since the introduction of the rookie wage scale in 1995 an innovation the commissioner touted as a disincentive for players to turn pro gifted teenagers have bypassed college and entered the league in increasing numbers the current collective bargaining agreement locks players into a scaled salary structure for the first four years of their professional careers they do not become true free agents until after their fifth season imagine an 18yearold with the talent and desire to turn pro under the current system , he can seek an agreement that maximizes his earning potential at 22 at the expiration of his first postrookiescale contract , he will be young enough \( 28 or 29 \) to attract another significant deal but if he were to attend four years of college , he would enter the nba at 22 and not be eligible for free agency until 26 at the end of that first major deal he would be 33 far less likely to command another major one in garnett s case , those four extra years of college could have cost him as much as 100 million no wonder the nba wants to make teenagers wait ! if commissioner stern really wanted high school players to attend college , he would reduce the number of years players are subject to the belowmarket salaries mandated by the rookie scale at the least that would give high school students an incentive to attend college he could further protect teenagers from bad decisions by forging an agreement with the national collegiate athletic association that would allow those not picked in the first round of the nba draft to withdraw from consideration and retain their college eligibility the nba could mirror major league baseball , which provides a scholarship fund that enables players signing out of high school or college to complete their education the nba will not its goal is ncaa sports participation , not education an education can be acquired during the summer and or after the end of the individual s professional basketball career antawn jamison , o'neal , juwan howard and jerry stackhouse are recent examples of nba players who went back to college and earned their degree after leaving early to turn pro the league addresses the issue of underage players by proposing an arbitrary age limit and a developmental league for borderline talents , 20 and older do not be fooled altruism has nothing to do with these proposals the projected minor league would be merely another source of revenue and control of young talent for nba owners most distressingly , it would be a new carrot dangled before marginal players these players , many of whom would leave school to impress nba scouts , would really benefit from completing their educations the real issue for the ncaa and the nba is the same money the ncaa is strangely silent about baseball , a sport in which more youngsters are signed straight out of high school in a single year than have been in the entire history of the nba draft the reason is simple basketball is a highprofile , revenuegenerating sport for the ncaa and its member institutions college baseball is not witness the 6 billion contract from cbs for the exclusive television rights for the college basketball tournament if the ncaa were really interested in protecting young people it would abolish the punitive rule that provides complete loss of eligibility if high school graduates unlike collegians make themselves available to be drafted what the ncaa should do is allow these individuals the opportunity to test the draft waters and see if they sink or swim that way the prodigies like bryant , garnett and mcgrady can safely pursue their careers while the lesser prospects can withdraw from the draft and pursue an education the ncaa has adopted the idea of offering loans of up to 20 , 000 to a select few players to induce them to remain in school this proposal is laughable and highly unlikely to persuade a kevin garnett to pass on a multimilliondollar guarantee and risk a lifetime of financial security it is time for the nba and ncaa to establish reasonable rules that encourage young people to attend college for the sake of education , not ncaa sports participation the nba and its hallelujah choir talk often about making choices and drawing lines in support of their agelimit agenda well , our nation s courts and legislatures have already set 18 as the age at which a young man can get married , vote and fight in foreign wars surely that same teenager can handle the pressures of playing in the nba photo the timberwolves' star , kevin garnett , went straight to the nba from high school \( reuters \)

in fay weldon s novels there are no ads in the margins of the pages , none on the dust jacket , unless you count the publisher s name and logo , and none on the flyleaves or endpapers that is one of the things we expect from books , a clean space in which the words can do their work , uncluttered by the visual din of advertising but in ms weldon s newest novel , the bulgari connection , some of the words themselves are an advertisement for the jeweler bulgari ms weldon s novel was commissioned by bulgari as a private literary bauble to celebrate the opening of a new store on sloane street in london ms weldon s task was to stud her work with references to the jeweler what makes this unusual is not ms weldon s decision to write a commissioned novel , which resembles the decision many artists and writers have made , for instance , when asked to create works for a popular brand of vodka but ms weldon s publishers have decided to issue the bulgari connection as a novel on its own , which turns it into a landmark literary example of paid product placement , a common practice in the movies ms weldon has been irreverent about the whole thing have i betrayed the sacred name of literature \? she has been quoted as saying well , what the heck ! irreverence is often becoming to ms weldon , and it probably reflects the spirit in which she undertook the writing of the bulgari connection , as well as the spirit in which she cashed the check the worrisome thing is the reaction of some agents , editors and publishers to the idea they have sounded exultant , as if they heard cash registers ringing in their heads the painful thought of all the recent novels filled with wellknown brand names and not a penny paid to include them is offset by the thought of all the novels filled with product placement opportunities , including the sale of naming rights , yet to be written perhaps the sacred name of literature does n't really need defending from paid product placement the marketplace alone may do the job well enough the really profitable authors are the very ones who can afford to refuse paid ads in their prose the writers at the bottom of the heap wo n't be asked but if this idea catches on , how will a midlist author , encouraged by editor and agent alike , resist the temptation to turn his work into a billboard \? only one thing is really certain when it comes to choosing where to spend the advertising dollar , corporations will soon discover that writers nearly always mean trouble they nearly always have
san francisco when the country s largest private manager of public schools arrived here in 1998 , it promised to turn around a particularly troubled elementary school the company , edison schools , appears to have kept its word at the school , the edison charter academy , the percentage of students scoring in the upper half nationally on mathematics and reading tests has more than doubled , while the number in the lowest ranks has been cut by a third the school s enrollment has risen by nearly 50 percent , students have new computers , and residents say the school is a safer , more welcome neighbor yet flush with a newly elected majority dominated by edison opponents , the san francisco board of education recently began the process of revoking edison s contract , which runs through 2003 edison s opponents on the board and in the community contend that the improved scores have less to do with changed educational practices than with a changed student population , and they accuse edison of forcing poorly performing students to go to other schools the opponents have failed to offer concrete evidence that edison has forced out students to increase its test scores , however , and what appears to underlie their objections is a philosophical opposition to a school run by a company whose purpose is to earn a profit i do n't think forprofit companies have any place here , said dana woldow , a mother of three children in san francisco public schools , though not at the edison school in public schools , she said , there is never such a thing as leftover money h christopher whittle , the founder and president of edison schools , said the company would fight to retain its contract , in court if necessary the statistics literally speak for themselves here , he said none of the 44 other cities where we manage schools has ever done anything like this the debate over the edison charter academy has become a kind of dialogue of the deaf that offers a warning for school systems around the country , including new york city s , which is facing growing opposition to the board of education s proposal to give edison control over five failing public schools parents at each of those schools are to vote later this month on whether to let edison manage their school at issue is whether private companies have anything to offer or should be allowed to offer anything in the effort to improve public education the san francisco conflict shows how hard it can be even to agree on the terms of the debate , as opponents and supporters argue past each other , each ignoring inconvenient facts and sometimes drawing unwarranted conclusions the confusing context of the dispute may be best illustrated when edison s opponents on the san francisco school board say that if they succeed in removing the company , they may still want to continue edison s academic programs i think our commitment should be that if there are things that are working that we can afford , we should keep them , said jill wynns , president of the san francisco school board edison was invited to san francisco by waldemar rojas , who was superintendent for seven years and left in june 1999 to become superintendent of the dallas system in 1998 , the board voted 5 to 2 to support mr rojas s effort to let edison run one school but a new majority , opposed to edison , took control of the board in november the forces against edison have questioned the legitimacy of the contract that mr rojas signed with the company , the high teacher turnover at the edison school and edison s financial operations but mostly they have promoted a single principle profitseeking companies should stay out of public education racial and economic class questions also appear to be part of the edison debate opponents contend that some , if not all , of the improvement in the school s scores on standardized tests stems from a change in the school s population under edison it now has fewer impoverished black students and more middleclass and hispanic students , they say they are not taking the same disadvantaged students as before , said caroline grannan , who has two children in public elementary schools , but not in the edison school she has waged an email campaign against edison the demographic issue is a complicated one san francisco has an open enrollment system , meaning that parents can apply for their children to attend any school in the city those who do not make a choice are assigned to a school by district officials before edison schools took it over , the school now known as the edison charter academy received many assigned students though the school is in noe valley , a middleclass neighborhood in the center of the san francisco peninsula , students were mainly drawn from the poorer and largely latino neighborhood known as the mission , which is nearby , and from hunters point , an impoverished , largely black industrial neighborhood a few miles away , on san francisco bay since edison came in , enrollment has grown to 550 from 370 approximately 30 percent of the school s students this year are black , down from an average of 38 percent in the four years before edison took over in 1998 during the same period , the school s latino population has climbed to 53 percent from 45 percent

racing team at the 1986 indianapolis 500 people recall that famous race because the truesports' patron , jim trueman , was battling cancer at the time , mr morris said he had never won as an indy owner , which was his life goal it was a superb race , with the closest freeway finish in the history of indianapolis it was won on the last bend and the car s fuel light was on another lap and bobby would have lost everyone was in tears there was a standing ovation trueman died 10 days later mr morris said race car engines were often replaced after a race , but the march 86c engine was saved none of the other indy 500winning cars still has the original engine , mr morris said , which may explain the estimate of 600 , 000 to 800 , 000 lot 29 , another of mr ryan s cars , is a completely different type , a classic open car the 1931 cadillac model 452a sport phaeton , with dark blue coachwork , has a 16cylinder engine and a blue leather interior it is one of the ultimate classicera cars , mr morris said they did n't make many sports phaetons during the depression because it was expensive to build and to sell less than 10 genuine ones are known to exist he said the v16 engine was the most powerful ever made , though its vibration was so minimal you could stand a quarter on its end on the hood and it would not be knocked over the estimate is 400 , 000 to 500 , 000 lot 34 is a 1933 rollsroyce phantom ii torpedo tourer with four doors , which was made for the raja of hathoura , in india one of the few remaining custom rollsroyces from the golden age of the british raj , it has a polished aluminum body and red leather interior it looks as contemporary as a titanium museum by frank gehry a lot of classic cars were made of aluminum , mr morris said the maharajah probably went for it because it reflects the heat instead of absorbing it the rolls has large spotlights mounted on either side of the windshield such cars were often used for tiger shooting , mr morris explained the car was discovered in derelict shape near calcutta in the mid1970 s and taken to england for restoration these cars are actually quite rare now because india brought in stringent export regulations in the late 1970 s , he said you cannot legally export them from india now they see them as national treasures the estimate is 250 , 000 to 350 , 000 the pebble beach car sales include some vintage motorcycles , including two indian chiefs in lot 3 , christie s is selling a 1947 indian chief once owned by pete conrad , the third man to walk on the moon like lawrence of arabia , mr conrad developed a passion for motorcycles after he returned to civilian life \( and like lawrence , he died on one \) he bought this indian chief , which is red with a fringed black leather seat , in the early 1990 s its estimate is 30 , 000 to 40 , 000 bonhams brooks is selling a 1940 indian chief \( lot 213 \) that steve mcqueen owned until his death mcqueen s first bike , purchased in the 1950 s , was a 1946 indian chief like james dean , elvis presley and dennis hopper , he went on to collect motorcycles his riding skill was evident in his stunt work in the great escape and on any sunday mcqueen tested dirt bikes for popular science magazine and raced bikes , often using the pseudonym harvey mushman , with his friends bud elkins and robert riddell he was the last great juvenile delinquent movie star , michael sragow wrote in esquire gentlemen magazine in 1993 when cool had meaning , he had cool mr osborne , noting that mcqueen was a fanatic about motorcycles , cars and planes , said that the indian chief in the sale was a cruising bike for hollywood , not one he used for trail riding in the desert , though it could go about 100 miles per hour the bike is a creamy white with a bright chartreuse leather seat and fenders that have deep skirts it has no windshield you probably would n't find a windshield on a steve mcqueen bike , mr osborne said , adding that its engine is the size of one in a small european car the indian chief is a style icon , he said these bikes were seen as classics they were made at a time when most of the manufacturers in the us and uk were at their height the estimate is 45 , 000 to 55 , 000 lot 257 is a 1950 jaguar xk120 sports roadster that won one of the first pebble beach road races in 1950 it was the first racing victory in the career of phil hill , america s first formula one world champion , mr osborne said his clutch blew up as the race was starting , so winning it was no mean feat winning a race without a clutch is more than impressive at the time , mr osborne explained , jaguar was just beginning to export cars to america and phil s victory in the race put jaguar on the launch pad in the united states lot 241 is a 1956 ferrari 500 testa rossa spider corsa race car that has been driven by some of the best drivers in the country it was bought in 1956 by johnny von neumann , a california car importer who

a texas oilman who was aboard the submarine greeneville said yesterday that its officers made six sweeps with the periscope at two slightly different depths but saw no other ships less than 10 minutes before it surfaced and slammed into a japanese fishing trawler the businessman , john m hall , was one of two civilians who handled some of the submarine s controls at the start of the surfacing drill that caused the accident on feb 9 the greeneville shot to the surface , crashing into and sinking the ehime maru , a 190foot japanese fishing trawler nine people on the trawler , including four japanese students , are missing and presumed dead mr hall s comments , made during a telephone interview , show that the greeneville s captain , lt cmdr scott waddle , did more to check the area for other ships than had been known but as navy and other safety investigators search for what went wrong , submarine experts said the comments left them even more baffled how the crew could have failed to detect a trawler so close by as soon as the periscope was raised , mr hall said , a submarine officer made two 360degree rotations and indicated that the area was clear commander waddle then rotated the scope twice before giving orders to raise the submarine , and thus the height of the periscope , by two feet , mr hall said he said the commander looked through the twirling scope two more times retired submarine officers say that a scope provides greater visibility and the ability to see greater distances the higher it is raised the height of the periscope is key because the navy has said the seas were choppy , with swells as tall as six feet mr hall said he did not know how far the scope rose above the sea retired submarine officers say that in training exercises , a periscope would normally be raised about four to six feet above the seas but some say that in choppy conditions and when visibility was difficult , it would be more prudent to extend the scope as high as 20 to 30 feet above the seas mr hall said that he and some of the 15 other civilians watched a blackandwhite monitor that displayed the periscope s view asked what he saw during the six searches , he responded nothing but gray mr hall , who first discussed the accident on nbc s today show on thursday , said that 10 minutes later , when the submarine shuddered with the force of the collision , commander waddle was so surprised that he asked , what the hell was that \? in yesterday s interview , mr hall also provided more details about how the civilians had arranged the submarine ride and about the haunting confusion following the accident mr hall said that as the trawler s passengers spilled into the sea in life rafts , the submarine officers did not know at first if they were japanese or chinese and asked if any civilian spoke either language and could help the crews communicate later , he said , an officer announced over the submarine s intercom that all 35 people on the trawler had been saved , promoting cheers among the civilians , who had been sent to wait in the torpedo room about 10 minutes later , mr hall said , the officer took back that assessment , saying that we have only 26 accounted for then , mr hall said , some women in his group began crying , and the despair set in mr hall also said he disagreed with criticism in japan that the submarine crew did not do enough to try to save the trawler s passengers he said a diver was prepared to exit a hatch toward the rear of the submarine , but that the sea swells made it too dangerous to open the hatch at that point , the submarine s crew did not realize anyone from the trawler was missing , mr hall said the greeneville officers , he said , also feared that if the hatch was opened , so much water could flood in that it would harm the submarine mr hall , 52 , has said he was the civilian who pulled a switch that set off the emergency surfacing operation he said a crew member put his hands over mr hall s to make sure the switch was engaged navy officials have said that a second civilian , also under close supervision , held a wheel that helped guide the submarine s ascent in tokyo , japan s defense minister , toshitsugu saito , said it was outrageous that civilians were at the controls of the submarine japan s foreign minister , yohei kono , called secretary of state colin l powell to demand more information about what the civilians were doing at the time of the incident and defense secretary donald h rumsfeld met yesterday at the pentagon with a japanese envoy to discuss japan s concerns about the accident navy officials have insisted that the civilians did nothing to contribute to the accident the navy has long taken civilians , as well as government officials and journalists , on such outings to build support but navy officials said yesterday they would no longer conduct emergency surfacing drills with civilians on board or let them sit at controls mr hall said he did not see any sign that the visitors distracted the officers from their jobs he said the sub had been at sea for more than six hours before the accident , and most civilians had already taken turns operating the levers that control the submarine s depth and direction when he passed through the sonar room earlier in the day , he said , the operators were tracking five vessels but mr hall said he did not know if they ever detected the trawler mr hall , an energyindustry consultant , served as a marine in vietnam he said he had lobbied for nearly a year to get a ride on a submarine , which , he said , he viewed as the opportunity of a lifetime he said he met retired admiral richard c macke , who suggested the civilians for the greeneville cruise , last spring while they were both involved in a golf tournament to raise money for restoration work on the uss missouri , the world war ii battleship on which the japanese surrendered in 1945 mr hall was then the chief executive of fossil bay resources ltd , an oil and gas company in texas that paid 7 , 500 to the uss missouri memorial association in honolulu to be a sponsor of the golf tournament earlier this week , admiral thomas fargo , the commander of the pacific fleet , told several congressmen that most civilians on the greeneville were donors to the missouri restoration fund but mr hall said that was incorrect he said he believed only one couple on board , michael and susan nolan of honolulu , had given money to the memorial he said the others were just a social group that we put together mr hall s wife , leigh ann , was on board , as was another former fossil bay executive , todd thoman and his wife , deanda mr hall would not identify any others in the group he said that none of the civilians were politically active or had any business ties to admiral macke when a hell of an opportunity like this comes up to go on a submarine , you get a group together , he said it s just that simple

wells , nev , aug 13 like so many truckstop towns along the nation s wideopen stretches of highway , wells is one blink away from the rearview mirror , a pause between interstate 80 and us 93 , with more big rigs than cars , more cows than people , and a family restaurant that doubles as a casinosaloon what makes wells different from other small towns outside rural nevada is its two brothels they stand across the railroad tracks from the remains of wells s historic downtown , a dusty street of nearly abandoned twostory buildings built in the gold rush the squat , motellike brothels are not hiding signs on highway 93 point the way to both but donna s ranch and the hacienda ranch brothels in nevada are always ranches do not flaunt themselves , either travelers stopping by wells from i80 are likely to miss them altogether for nevada s 30odd licensed brothels , most of them in rural outposts like wells , this unassuming approach to business is the way to survive as the only state where brothels are legal , nevada is sensitive to the possibility of upsetting the public s sense of decorum as long as the brothels are lowkey and out of the way \( they are banned in the state s biggest cities , las vegas and reno \) , the general wisdom here goes , everyone is happy the average resident accepts it , said neil harris , the sheriff of elko county , a swath of northeastern nevada that has five brothels , including the two in wells it s an accepted practice but lately , the brothel industry has been nervous in an example that proves the industry s thesis about undue attention , last month a brothel owner in pahrump , 60 miles outside las vegas in nye county , announced plans to turn sheri s ranch into a fullscale resort with an 18hole golf course , casino and steakhouse this idea for a new kind of brothel did not square with nevada s tradition it attracted criticism all around , from irate editorials \( the brothel industry cannot survive in the spotlight , said the reno gazettejournal \) to a slap on the wrist from the nevada brothel association , the industry s main lobbying group things are very bad right now , said george flint , the association s executive director , referring to the recent publicity the brothel association may be one of the few lobbying groups that considers any publicity bad publicity , and whose job it is to stay out of the news , rather than in it as mr flint sees it , just because it s legal does n't mean it s always going to be legal so as for sheri s , he said , no one s going to talk about the resort the owner of sheri s ranch , chuck lee , a retired police officer and car dealer from las vegas who bought the brothel in january , does not want to talk about it either i'm referring all calls these days to george flint , he said this week even so , everyone from the sheriff to the pahrump city manager says mr lee s plans for sheri s ranch are going nowhere and the criticism he endured shows why nevada s brothels , which began opening in the gold rush and became legal and regulated in 10 of the state s 17 counties beginning in 1971 , have remained virtually unchanged for decades most even look as they did decades ago like 1970 sera roadside motels , with d cor out of the days of discos and most follow the rule of having customers buzzed into the brothel to a lineup of 5 to 15 women in stilettos , hairpieces and negligees the brothel managers , or madams , are usually older women \( at donna s ranch , the manager , known as mom , is in her 80 s \) , and the customers are usually truckers or hunters just passing through over the years , the industry has fought off its share of enemies , most prominently the internal revenue service , not exactly a favorite institution for many governmenthating nevadans in 1990 , the irs went after the most famous brothel , the mustang ranch , and its owner , joe conforte , for failure to pay taxes he fled to south america , but in 1999 federal prosecutors succeeded in padlocking the mustang ranch , just outside reno , after a jury decided that mr conforte with cohorts , including a former sheriff , as fronts was still running the brothel from his hiding place abroad other foes have included politicians and antiprostitution citizens' groups that surface now and again and declare a mission to outlaw the industry , but none ever stick that has dismayed most big city editorialists the reno gazettejournal suggested recently if they get a chance to see what it s really like , nevadans just may turn against it and ban prostitution history suggests we 'd be better off but in rural counties , most local officials have nothing but pleasant things to say about the brothels mike franzoia , the mayor of elko , where two brothels are within walking distance of the heart of downtown , said they were quiet neighbors they 're good they 're innocuous , he said nobody really knows they 're there as for problems , i 've been in elko 21 years , never read up on any trouble , and i 've been mayor for 6 years and have n't seen anything it s pretty well regulated the city manager , linda ritter , agreed it s a very quiet business we really do n't have any issues , any problems the brothels have been here for a very long time mr franzoia even sees them as providing a needed service it provides a discreet service to the community , in a unique way , obviously we do n't have as many , i would think , sex crimes as would be normal because there is an outlet to take care of those issues gray woodbury , the elko county district attorney , said brothels had not been much of a law enforcement problem the community seems to tolerate them , he said , and there is no advertising and the girls are n't allowed to solicit on the street or anything like that so they essentially keep to themselves in nye county , which includes the two brothels in pahrump and a handful of others , the sheriff , wade a lieseke jr , said the brothels were a relief to law enforcement , with very , very , very few problems as a law enforcement officer , i do n't have a problem with brothels because i do n't have to spend money to police prostitution , mr lieseke said reno and las vegas spend millions policing prostitution because it s illegal there our county actually makes money off the licensing of brothels brothels pay registration and licensing fees , sometimes adding hundreds of thousands of dollars to county coffers each year chuck stidham , the town manager of pahrump , said the local ambulance services received 60 , 000 from the licensing fees for its two brothels , about half the fees the brothels pay to nye county it s a pretty good chunk of change , he said not to mention that the prostitutes , who work as independent contractors , pay the counties for their required weekly tests for sexually transmitted diseases mr flint of the nevada brothel association likes to point out donna s ranch here , billed as nevada s oldest brothel , as one of the best examples of the business the brothel , once owned by jack dempsey , gives out free coffee or tea , and the prostitutes give tourists tours of the rooms but even the best sometimes have problems not long ago , a feud broke out between donna s and the hacienda when one put a sign on the access road advertising free parking the other complained that the free parking was in its parking lot the wells city council told them that they had to work out their problems and sort out this nonsense or they would obviously be shut down , said mr woodbury , the district attorney things have been quiet ever since photos like other legal brothels in nevada , donna s ranch , on the outskirts of wells , does not try to hide itself on us 93 near wells , nev , a sign points toward a brothel \( photographs by monica almeida the new york times \) map of nevada highlighting wells nevada has 30odd legal brothels
in its long and sometimes sordid history , suffolk county has witnessed its share of highprofile feuding and fighting among its top officials one of the bitterest battles is scheduled to spill over into a courtroom in central islip on monday that s when the suffolk county sheriff , patrick a mahoney , will go on trial on misconduct , fraud and corruption charges that could send him to jail for four years mr mahoney says the authorities have the wrong man he says it is his chief accuser , district attorney james m catterson jr , who really must be brought to justice and in this opinion mr mahoney is not alone over the years , there have been officials , lawyers and probably a few judges in suffolk county who wanted nothing more than for mr catterson to stand trial or be removed from office for abusing his powers as chief prosecutor mr catterson and prosecutors are letting the indictment talk for them it depicts a flagrant , yearslong pattern of abuse by mr mahoney the 90count indictment , returned in june by a grand jury that heard more than 130 witnesses over 15 months , charges that mr mahoney , in concert with former undersheriff edward j morris , ran his election campaigns out of the sheriff s office , using onduty county workers as his campaign staff and squeezing subordinates for contributions in exchange for good job assignments and promotions the indictment said that in one instance in 1994 , mr morris told union officials to contribute 30 , 000 to the mahoney campaign in return for better labor relations william j maggi , president of the 714member suffolk county correctional officers association , said the pressure for officers to contribute to mr mahoney s campaigns was the worstkept secret in the world and began almost as soon as mr mahoney was elected he said mr morris was the conduit we were told it was a twoway street , you scratch my back i scratch yours , and that it was a show of loyalty , mr maggi said it was the perception among the majority of members that giving was the way to move ahead mr maggi said officers also received political flyers and invitations to mahoney fundraisers that were mailed to their homes it made you uncomfortable , he said but he said it was hard to say whether officers who declined to contribute suffered as a result mr mahoney , 58 , a former police detective and county legislator first elected sheriff in 1990 , said he and mr morris never put pressure on anyone to contribute it s absolute rubbish , he said anyone who testifies that they have been forced to make donations to our campaigns for better jobs or better positions is an outright liar among those who know the county and its ways , there were murmurings that mr mahoney may have only followed common practice in a paytoplay environment , and that mr catterson had selectively cracked down on what was , after all , just another hand in the cookie jar jury selection begins on monday , with state supreme court justice richard buchter , who normally works in queens , presiding as part of an effort to avoid any suggestion of judicial bias mr mahoney has cast himself as the victim of what he called ludicrous charges trumped up by an outofcontrol district attorney relentlessly bent on payback , but so powerful and vindictive that none dared try to stop him everybody in county government is in fear of this man , mr mahoney said in an interview last week they all know what he is the man is psychotic it s frightening that he can get away with this kind of terrorism mr catterson , 70 , who is seeking election to a fourth fouryear term , has said that the notion of a feud between the two men is all in mr mahoney s mind he declined through a spokesman , drew biondo , to comment further in view of the pending trial in announcing the indictments in june , mr catterson said in a statement that he was deeply saddened to bring such charges against a law enforcement official it is a very unpleasant chore and i am sorely burdened by it , he said but , he said , he believed very strongly that one of my duties is to protect decent government workers from intimidation by any superior it is mr catterson who is often accused of being the intimidator in the early 1990 s , five top county officials , including mr mahoney and other prominent republicans , said mr catterson had threatened during the course of various disputes to bring them in front of grand juries one dispute involved an investigation by the county legislature into a county carleasing deal that mr catterson s son , james m catterson , then an assistant county attorney , had played a leading role in negotiating donald r blydenburgh , then the presiding officer of the county legislature , said at the time that the senior mr catterson told him to drop the carlease investigation or be hauled before a grand jury mr mahoney said mr catterson made a similar threat during their first public dispute the 1993 case of katie beers , a 10yearold who survived 16 days of imprisonment by a pedophile in an underground chamber in bay shore in a story that drew national attention each man accused the other of trying to invade miss beers s privacy by arranging a press photo opportunity of the child reuniting with her mother mr catterson has said he was particularly irked by the charge and had gone to extraordinary lengths to protect the child
oklahoma city , aug 31 the rev charles story has been a spiritual adviser for several death row inmates in oklahoma , counseling them in the hours before their executions in all but one of those cases , mr story said , the inmates confessed their crimes and asked for forgiveness the exception was malcolm rent johnson he said , 'i'm innocent , and i 've got peace in my heart , and i'm ready to go home , ' said mr story , a parttime chaplain who was among the last people to speak with mr johnson before his execution on jan 6 , 2000 the question of mr johnson s guilt or innocence , and the possibility that he was wrongly executed , is one of the issues arising from a broad investigation of joyce gilchrist , the oklahoma city police scientist whose work in roughly 1 , 200 cases is being scrutinized by state officials ms gilchrist , who has denied any wrongdoing , has been the focus of the expansive inquiry since march , when a report by the federal bureau of investigation criticized her work in may , jeffrey pierce , who was imprisoned for 15 years on a rape conviction , was released after dna testing disproved ms gilchrist s pivotal testimony against him mr johnson is one of 12 people who have been put to death in oklahoma after ms gilchrist s testimony helped convict them another 11 inmates she testified against remain on death row attorney general drew edmondson expressed confidence in may that none of the executed inmates had been wrongly put to death , with one exception he said he wanted to review mr johnson s case he later said the evidence had convinced him that mr johnson was guilty , too this week , though , internal police memorandums have raised questions about ms gilchrist s testimony in mr johnson s 1982 trial during the trial , ms gilchrist said mr johnson s blood type matched sperm collected from a bedspread and a pillowcase in the victim s apartment the samples were on six slides but an examination of the slides on july 30 contradicted ms gilchrist s findings , one memorandum said , and concluded that the slides actually contained no sperm at all the memorandum , first reported by the daily oklahoman and the associated press , was written by the oklahoma city police department s dna laboratory manager , laura schile , and was endorsed by three other chemists in the laboratory ms schile resigned this month because of what her lawyer has described as a hostile work environment it certainly does concern me when you have different chemists saying different things , said mr edmondson , who played down the significance of ms gilchrist s testimony in winning the conviction it does not shake my confidence that malcolm rent johnson was guilty of that murder the other evidence is overwhelming however , robert ravitz , who represented mr johnson during his trial , said ms gilchrist s testimony was essential because the other evidence was largely circumstantial i do n't know if malcolm johnson committed the crime or not , said mr ravitz , who now leads oklahoma city s public defender office i know that absent of gilchrist s testimony , there would have been no way he would have been convicted the crime in question was the rape and murder of ura alma thompson , a 76yearold woman who lived alone in an oklahoma city apartment her nephew discovered her body in the apartment on oct 27 , 1981 initially her death appeared to have been from natural causes , but the medical examiner ruled that it was a homicide after discovering bruises and evidence of rape mr johnson was arrested the same day on a weapons charge in his apartment , officers discovered two sets of keys , a wristwatch , a necklace and a handpainted vase all items that belonged to ms thompson investigators also learned that mr johnson had twice been convicted of rape in illinois finally , two other elderly women identified him as the man who had raped them , while three other people said he had attacked them it was a seemingly strong case , but circumstantial ms gilchrist s testimony , however , enabled prosecutors to put mr johnson inside the apartment during the rape she said that the semen samples matched mr johnson s blood type and that hairs found at the apartment matched his she also said a blue coloration on hairs found at the apartment matched cotton fibers collected from mr johnson s shirt in his closing argument , the oklahoma county district attorney , robert h macy , defended ms gilchrist s testimony , saying mr ravitz had unfairly sought to undermine her credibility he had to attack joyce gilchrist , because joyce gilchrist gave him the testimony that firmly erased any reasonable doubt , any doubt at all in this case , mr macy said you look at her testimony , he added and sure she s young you 've got to start sometime but she s good and she s thorough , and you heard her at the time , ms gilchrist was in her second year as chemist for the police in 1994 she was promoted to a supervisory position and stopped doing laboratory work mr ravitz asked the judge to authorize money for the defense to hire a forensic expert to counter ms gilchrist s testimony he was denied at the time , oklahoma law did not authorize such expenditures , though it does today during mr johnson s later appeals , two forensic experts hired by the defense were harshly critical of ms gilchrist s conclusions , particularly on the bluecolored hairs an assessment such as this has little value due to the ubiquitous nature of blue cotton , one of the experts , dr peter r deforest of ardsley , ny , wrote in 1997 inexplicably gilchrist s testimony seems to confound , confuse , dr deforest added , noting that matching the shirt with bluetinged hairs seems doubtful evidence in mr johnson s case is expected to be analyzed by a private laboratory in july , a local defense lawyer , douglas parr , sued the police department on the johnson case , seeking to open additional records , and he has requested that dna tests be conducted on the evidence for now , mr parr and city officials are sparring over which private laboratory will analyze the evidence , assuming there is enough evidence to analyze mr edmondson , the district attorney , said he did not think we 're in disagreement that there needs to be some testing he said the local police would turn over the evidence to the oklahoma state bureau of investigation for safekeeping the immediate emphasis , mr edmondson said , was to examine current cases to make certain that no inmates are wrongly incarcerated today , state officials announced that 600 of the roughly 1 , 200 cases linked to ms gilchrist had received initial reviews of that total , 99 have been marked for further examination , including the cases of three death row inmates meanwhile , ms gilchrist , who is on administrative leave , is in the midst of a confidential personnel hearing to determine whether she will be fired it is expected to last until next week she was extremely important to the oklahoma county district attorney s office , mr parr said she was one of their star witnesses photo joyce gilchrist , the police scientist who is under investigation , returning to a hearing last month in oklahoma city with her lawyer , melvin hall \( associated press \)
albany , feb 5 as the push to ease new york state s mandatory drugsentencing laws has drawn the onceimprobable support of leading republican lawmakers lately , one influential interest group has refused to join the chorus prosecutors across the state , who regard the socalled rockefeller drug laws as their most powerful weapon against drug dealers last week , the prosecutors , a politically potent cadre , spoke up and intensified its lobbying against softening the mandatory sentences the new york state district attorneys association , representing all 62 county prosecutors , wrote a letter to gov george e pataki , who has pledged to ease the laws , as well as to assembly speaker sheldon silver and the senate majority leader , joseph l bruno the district attorneys association has put in calls to lawmakers and has selected a panel of prosecutors from rochester to queens to meet with the governor it has scheduled a briefing with members of the republicancontrolled senate , perhaps the prosecutors' strongest allies here and it has been invited to meet with mr silver , a democrat , who in the coming weeks is expected to release his own proposal to soften drug laws under current laws , judges have little discretion over whether a drug offender will be imprisoned , and if so , for how long instead , they must operate within a range of minimum and maximum sentences that take into account only the amount of the drug seized and the defendant s felony record not whether the crime involved violence two weeks ago , governor pataki announced his intention to change this his plan would allow for shorter mandatory terms for drug offenders serving some of the longest sentences , treatment instead of incarceration in some cases and some sentencing discretion for judges the judicial restrictions now effectively give prosecutors far greater control of cases , allowing them to use the threat of long sentences to squeeze plea bargains from some prisoners and to force others into drug treatment my concern is that we not go too far in giving away our discretion , the bronx district attorney , robert t johnson , said in an interview this is the first year where i 've sensed something is going to happen political activism is unusual for the state s prosecutors , who are only occasionally outspoken on legislation none of the state s other law enforcement groups with a stake in the issue police chiefs , sheriffs , the state correction officers union have been as outspoken the most radical part of the governor s proposal reducing the mandatory terms for those serving the longest is not entirely objectionable to prosecutors , since it addresses a symbolically important but relatively small clutch of drug offenders a bill has yet to be introduced , but once it is , both sides say privately , the real fight will be over the fate of the lowerlevel drug offenders and whether judges , instead of prosecutors , will decide who goes to treatment and who goes to jail , and how long the sentences will be we ca n't live with a system that takes out of prosecutors' hands the right to send predatory drug dealers to prison , said the schenectady district attorney , robert m carney , who is president of the statewide association over the years , mandatory sentencing laws have been credited for locking up some of the biggest drug dealers for long periods of time , and blamed for imprisoning , also for long periods of time , drug addicts who turned to crime only to fuel their habits it is widely acknowledged that the drug laws , enacted in 1973 , crammed court dockets and state prisons \( new york s prison population has begun to drop only recently \) among the 70 , 000 inmates in the state , 21 , 000 are there on drug charges , and of those , about 4 , 200 are firsttime felons and although national studies have shown that drug users are mostly white , 95 percent of the drug offenders in state prisons are black or hispanic advocates for easing the drug laws , from catholic bishops to prisoners' rights groups to politicians representing the black and latino communities that bear the brunt of drug crimes and drug laws , point repeatedly to issues of cost , effectiveness and fairness the rockefeller drug laws , their argument goes , imprison scores of lowlevel drug offenders who need treatment , not jail a report promoting the benefits of treatment was released last week by the correctional association of new york , the main group beating the drum to overturn the drug laws citing outside research , the report found that treatment as an alternative to prison and treatment programs inside prison were less costly and better at reducing repeat offenses than incarceration alone as those hoping to change the stringent sentencing laws have gained political will from the decline in violent crime , the other side , too , has used the decline to assert its case violent crime is down dramatically in new york state and , in our view , one of the main reasons for the decline is the vigorous enforcement of our drug laws , says the letter from mr carney , sent to the lawmakers last wednesday it would be extremely shortsighted to respond to these outstanding reductions in violent crime by taking away the very tools we have used so effectively to make our communities safer

lattes flowed at starbucks with no sign of a big , silverhaired man compulsively shaking hands the grand union bustled with the ebb and flow of suv s , none toting a satellite dish from a tv news crew the question , however , is what will become of the first hamlet come saturday , when george w bush is inaugurated as president the clintons are expected to arrive here , at least for the night , after a rally at kennedy airport but whether they will put down roots and whether chappaqua will remain chappaqua is fodder for speculation and some skepticism what kind of greeting the clintons will get is unclear , with the news today that he had suffered the final indignity of his two terms with the suspension of his law license for five years and a 25 , 000 fine to end disbarment proceedings against him i really ca n't tell , said janet conkling , a member of chappaqua neighbors , a social group you 've got people who do n't really care what he did personally and for some that is important to them but then , in the year or so since the clintons moved into their house , people in town have always juggled conflicting feelings toward them , doubts about how much time they will spend here and questions about what their residency will mean it s been exciting , knowing that they are there , said lisa cardwall , waiting for lunch at the chappaqua restaurant and cafe , which the president has visited but at the same time , ms cardwall confessed , she has never seen either of the clintons and has detected few signs that they live here it seems surreal , she said i do n't think i will believe it until i see them in a way that looks like they live here and are not just visiting , like when i see bill clinton jogging downtown or something it has been hard for many to absorb the notion of chappaqua as a hometown for the clintons , since they have been seen mostly on occasions that were extensively covered by the media the first couple moving in , the president getting coffee , hillary rodham clinton reading at the library and the senate candidate and her husband voting during mrs clinton s campaign for the senate , detractors , including her opponents first mayor rudolph w giuliani and then representative rick a lazio openly joked about a house in chappaqua going up for sale when the race was over well , she won and aides to the clintons insist they will keep the chappaqua house , contrary to speculation that they will sell it and buy a condominium in manhattan both the former president and senator clinton will have offices in manhattan , and they bought a 285 million house in washington , where mrs clinton plans to live when congress is in session white house officials have said the chappaqua house is developing a more homey feel , but the clintons have not shaken the perception that they are only occasional suburbanites residents say the hamlet , part of the town of new castle \( population 17 , 000 \) , derives much of its excitement from youth sports leagues , making it seem an odd fit for a sometimes restless former president there are a handful of modest restaurants in the immediate area , and a single main commercial strip that boosters liken to a new england village while it is just a 45minute drive from manhattan , the downtown here is all but deserted after dark still , mr clinton has made it known he would like to relax a bit , and that is a practice chappaqua can accommodate , says marion s sinek , town supervisor of new castle we certainly give people the opportunity for privacy and lowkey living , mrs sinek said she also noted wryly that there was a vacancy on the town board all four members and mrs sinek are democrats but said she would understand if mr clinton saw debates over expanding the local water district as a step down , compared with , say , middle east peace negotiations hewing to its lowkey approach to celebrity residents , the town is not planning any kind of reception marking the clintons' arrival today and it may be just as well chappaqua has long been divided between those who relish the cachet the first family has brought to an already exclusive address and those who find the hullabaloo over the clintons absurd and the traffic congestion their motorcades bring deplorable you would n't believe the circus they create on these narrow streets , said alexander tate , who moved here 10 years ago from manhattan , in part to escape the hubbub of city life the traffic stops , mr tate said people come out of nowhere he gets out of his car and everything is tied up until he decides to leave when they are in town , people do tend to notice the press corps uses the grand union parking lot as a staging area mr clinton frequents lange s little store and delicatessen , across the street , and the starbucks a little ways down the road in the heart of downtown although his motorcade with an suv usually standing in for the presidential limousine usually stops for red lights and eschews sirens , police do block off some roads to ease his path
walk into the local video store and ask for the film koyaanisqatsi and you will likely get a blank stare in response even if you have managed to pronounce it correctly walk into best video in hamden and ask for the film and they will tell you they have it chances are , however , they will also tell you to try back later because it is currently being rented to someone in another time zone koyaanisqatsi , a 1983 film without actors or a traditional plot , but with a score by philip glass , is the most popular video among best video s newest breed of customers mailorder renters since 1995 , the store s vast collection of videos has been available to customers across the country through mailorder service hank paper , the store s founder and owner , said he has around 30 , 000 videos sixteen years ago , mr paper , who has taught film and written several screenplays , opened best video hoping to parlay his knowledge of movies into a successful business because of a limited budget , the business started small my idea then was to choose movies i really liked , he said in lieu of quantity , i would have a very select group of videos despite strong competition , the company took off , and that select group of videos ballooned into what mr paper thinks is one of the biggest collections of rare videos in the country as the collection grew , so did the number of outoftown and eventually outofstate visitors we 've always had people who went the extra mile literally for our collection , mr paper said we 'd get customers from rhode island and massachusetts coming in to rent videos and asking if they could return them by mail we also had local customers who would come in and say 'my cousin in dubuque ca n't get a hold of cary grant in none but the lonely heart ' so eventually we started the mailorder service it works like this customers browse best video s collection on its web site \( www bestvideo com \) , or call the store to check on a film s availability they then place their order via phone , fax , or email messages best video ships the order using secondday air and provides the customer with a prepaid return mailer from the united states postal service the price of a threenight rental of one tape , including shipping , is 1725 if a customer rents four or more videos , the price per tape decreases and the rental period increases four videos for seven nights costs 31 , and each additional tape costs around 5 the store will ship anywhere in the country shipments to hawaii and alaska cost an additional 10 aviv hassid , 55 , is a professor of physiology at the university of tennessee medical school in memphis and uses the service once a week i have rented many , many tapes a lot of them are foreign films , especially french , but i have also rented german , italian , indian and spanish films , said mr hassid , one of several mailorder customers reached via email messages the tapes i have requested are not available in memphis remarkably , best video almost always seems to have the tapes i request the most popular genres among mailorder renters , said chris lasala , who runs the mailorder operation , are classic films from the 40 s and 50 s , foreign films and gay films , all of which may be poorly represented or not represented at all in the average video store best video does n't advertise the service mr lasala said , the best advertising for us has always been word of mouth many customers have found the store while searching for a particular video for example , koyaanisqatsi , extremely rare on video , has attracted customers nationwide simon kitchendunn , a consultant from healdsburg , calif , and margaret reed , a media services coordinator at the ouachita baptist university library , in arkadelphia , ark , both found best video as a result of a search for koyaanisqatsi i located an individual s web site that said best video was one of the only places to rent the video , ms reed said aaron clow , a 32yearold systems administrator from holbrook , ny , found best video while searching for a different rarity the tripods , a bbc miniseries in the past mr clow had been able to locate copies of rare videos on ebay or other online auction houses , but he could n't find the tripods anywhere eventually , however , he discovered a web site that mentioned that best video had the series best video is the only place that had what i was looking for , said mr clow , who has been pleased with the service the only way it could 've been better would be if they showed up at my house to pick them up not all of the mailorder requests come from people seeking rare films , however when mr lasala received an order for the seemingly ubiquitous the blair witch project , he realized that there must be other reasons to rent through the mail mr lasala thinks some of these anomalous orders come from people who live in extremely remote places , where there are no video stores he also thinks that some people are just plain lazy in january , he found himself dumbfounded when he received an order for the mummy , a 1999 movie starring brendan fraser that is seemingly on every video store shelf in america the customer was from brooklyn on another occasion , he received an order from a yale student i called him up and said we 're 10 minutes away , mr lasala said he said , 'yeah , i know' so we sent it to him best video is not the only company that offers mailorder rentals video library , which has two stores in philadelphia , has provided mailorder access to its collection of 20 , 000 films since 1990 video vault , a store in alexandria , va , that boasts having the guaranteed worst movies in town , also offers its eclectic collection to renters nationwide still , mailorder rental remains rare according to marcy magiera , editor of video business , a trade publication , rental by mail is by no means a popular practice in the industry there are stores here and there that do this , but it s not common , she said video rental is by and large an extremely local business there is some demand for less mainstream products , but it s more common for stores that have a love of movies and have expertise to do sales rather than rentals best video tried doing sales through its web site for a while , but found it could not compete with retail giants like amazoncom rental by mail has been more successful , producing about 20 orders each week , but best video has no plans to abandon its store for the world of online distributing it s a service it s not a huge money maker , mr lasala said with mailorder rentals , the profit margin is greater on each rental than with a local rental , but the videos are out of the store for longer , so it is difficult to gauge its profitability mr paper , however , seems less concerned with losing money than with losing videos many of the videotapes the store sends out are very difficult to replace , and he sometimes finds it nerveracking sending those videos out to unknown customers it does worry us , but business is n't without its risks , he said we do n't want to lock these videos up basically , we like movies , and we want to spread the word about good ones photos hank paper , right , owner of best video , opened the store 16 years ago in hamden mr paper , who said his store has 30 , 000 videos and he believes he has the largest collection of rare videos in the country his rare videos are popular among mailorder customers who pay 1725 for a threeday rental \( photographs by thomas mcdonald for the new york times \) \( scene

ogallala , neb , nov 9 there are many rules aboard greyhound bus no 6235 as it rumbles through the cornfields along interstate 80 from omaha no drinking , smoking or drugs no singing , whistling , gumcracking or cursing music must not spill from earphones spray your perfume somewhere else no matter what , do not cross the fresh yellow line painted on the floor , do not sit in the nowforbidden front seats , and do not absolutely do not talk to the driver while the bus is moving if you approach the driver and i jump , he warned , sounding like a cross between fieldtrip chaperon and prison guard , we might jump into a ditch the stern admonitions and strict rules are new , one more way the world has changed since sept 11 and , for greyhound , since oct 3 early that morning , a passenger slashed a driver s neck in tennessee , causing a crash that killed six people and bringing a sixhour halt to bus service nationwide that was the first of three serious attempts in a month to commandeer a greyhound bus , a rate far beyond the norm , though neither the company nor anyone else sees a clear reason for it just last weekend , a passenger craving a cigarette grabbed the wheel and sent a greyhound rolling onto its side south of phoenix , injuring 33 worried drivers like bus no 6235 s terry , who does not give out his last name but is known on midwestern highways as the irishman , have started packing pepper spray some , terry said , are even carrying handguns , which the company forbids ridership , which dropped by half immediately after sept 11 but returned to full strength within a week , has been stuck below normal since oct 3 but a greater percentage of riders are taking long trips and buying tickets in advance , as people afraid to fly try the bus greyhound has begun searching travelers and bags in 30 cities with handheld metal detectors , has issued emergency cellphones to hundreds of drivers and is looking into whether to build booths to enclose them for protection though most passengers go greyhound because they have more time than money or because it s the only way to get from , say , walcott junction , iowa , to grand island , neb some who were scared out of the skies by the terrorist attacks now find themselves nerveracked on the road as well in the airplane , 50 percent secure in the bus , 80 percent , enrique galindo , 28 , said in spanish as his crosscountry coach pushed through the dark emptiness west of des moines near midnight i am scared in the plane or the bus but i have to travel when mr galindo , a mexican immigrant who works as a cook , left san francisco for kenosha , wis , in april in search of lower rent and higher wages , the trip , by air , took four hours his return this week took 48 it s too slow , but it s safe , he said , then paused well , it s a little bit safer none of the recent greyhound incidents have been linked to terrorism , though there are rumors among drivers that a man on the fbi s watch list was recently tossed from a bus in wyoming \( a company spokeswoman said she had no record of this \) greyhound officials said that last year an average of about one passenger a day among 70 , 000 crisscrossing the 2 , 600 stops was removed for unruly behavior drivers and riders have seen that number rise in the last few weeks in chicago on tuesday , new security screeners stopped a 16yearold as he tried to board a bus with a loaded 357 magnum a driver at the omaha bus terminal said he had recently ousted a man carrying a knife , something he never would have bothered with before sept 11 in wednesday s wee hours , a woman bound for los angeles on bus no 6235 , whose back seat had terrorism scrawled in black marker on the upholstery , was dumped in iowa city because she had breached the yellow line to ask the driver to turn down the heat i watch everyone a little more than i used to , said terry , 56 , who has been driving for 26 years and said he would quit because of the recent incidents if he were not so close to retirement you get your goofballs using this as an excuse usually the crazies do n't do much other than go nuts , but now they 're starting to grab the wheel used to be , anyone could walk up to the counter , slap down cash and board a bus a few minutes later , no questions now the ticketbuyer s name is entered into a computer , and checked items are tagged with the rider s name and destination in chicago , inspectors took disposable razors from 31yearold jason waters , who , after suffering nervous breakdowns , is moving from chicago heights , ill , to portland , ore , because he likes computers and coffee they also ordered abijah morris , 21 , a navy recruit fresh from basic training and heading home to ventura , calif , to stow his bottle of crown royal \( mr morris nonetheless managed to get the bottle aboard , sneak nips in the bus bathroom , mix it with cherry coke in des moines and replenish his supply during a layover in omaha when he failed to find a strip club \) but there are no such searches at smaller depots like omaha s , and certainly not 341 miles down the interstate here in ogallala , the cowboy capital of nebraska , where a dozen buses stop daily at the country kitchen all day buffet \( 589 plus tax \)
new bern , nc when you 're down and out , lift up your head and shout at least nobody s building a hog lagoon in the neighborhood i found out at college , in class , says eva iyotte , a member of the rosebud sioux tribe who was happily studying native american culture when her instructor casually mentioned that the rosebud reservation was about to become the home of 860 , 000 hogs and their lagoons , which are basically lakes full of animal waste since then ms iyotte and her friends have organized , hired a lawyer and tossed out the old tribal leaders who invited corporate hog farming in but they have not managed to get rid of the several thousand pigs that now live within sniffing distance of her home the hog fights are one of the more interesting public policy debates in the nation today , and definitely a nice break for anybody who happens to be tired of thinking about john ashcroft this week both the hog growers and the corporatehoghaters held meetings at the same convention hall in north carolina on the banks of the neuse river , a body of water that the antihog forces say has been plagued with flesheating parasites because of the youknowwhats the north carolina pork council arrived first , its members waving fat notebooks full of environmental rules that they say have been imposed on them over the last five years we 're the most regulated in america , i think , said state senator john kerr , a man who has clearly never met a nuclear reactor or a new york city homeowner who wants permission to put in a second bathroom then , hot on the pork council s heels , came the hog summit , convened by rick dove of the water keeper alliance , who keeps a stack of photo albums bearing titles like sores and dead fish and things ms iyotte was there the featured speaker was robert kennedy jr i think there s way too many bridges down here for those kennedy boys , a state representative named leslie cox told the hog farmers on tuesday , to general merriment have i mentioned that there s quite a bit of bad feeling all around \? north carolina is the secondlargest pork growing state in the nation , after iowa , and over the last decade virtually all of its independent hog farmers have been driven out of business the pigs are now owned by the meat packers or their middlemen , and boarded out at what used to be called farms but are now known as concentrated animal feeding operations , or canfo s to the initiates thousands of swine live in buildings that look like lowrent industrial parks , fed by machines , segregated by age and impregnated through artificial insemination it s not precisely the way it looked in babe the factory farms did great things for the profit margins of the packers , who made sure that while they retained ownership of the pigs , they had no responsibility whatsoever for the manure almost overnight the poor , rural counties of eastern north carolina were covered with lagoons the smell drove the neighbors crazy the runoff went into the rivers and the wetlands it s an article of faith among the hog opponents that the state legislature did not begin to clamp down on the industry until somebody tried to put a canfo next to the pinehurst golf course the rules changed , said marion howard , who still thinks of himself as a family farmer even though he now raises somebody else s pigs on contract like many of the farmers , he s bewildered and angry that some people now seem to regard him as an environmental hazard none of his lagoons smell his son is operating an experimental farm that draws off the solid part of the hog waste and sells it to a worm farmer but the water keepers , who believe there s no such thing as a good lagoon , have named him as a defendant in their civil action suit the north carolina farmers have to deal with the problems the packers prodded them into creating but the hog industry , meanwhile , has gone trotting off to find new locations with cheap land and fewer rules idaho , utah , canada , poland , indian reservations the people in south dakota voted to not let corporate farming in the state , so they came in the back door to our reservation , says oleta mednansky of the rosebud sioux moral if there s a back door in your neighborhood , get a lock
nearly four weeks ago , stuart varney , the coanchor of cnn s moneyline news hour , left the network since then , the chair next to willow bay s has been empty cnn executives are looking for a big star to fill it and high on their list is none other than lou dobbs , people close to the situation say mr dobbs , the onetime anchor and mastermind of financial television news , left cnn in frustration with its management nearly two years ago since his departure , the show has lost more than 25 percent of its audience but mr dobbs , who now writes a financial newsletter and produces radio spots in a joint venture with nbc and heads the spacecom web site , ultimately declined an invitation to return to cnn last year cnn executives are said to understand that there is a good chance he would do the same this time around there is , however , a way he could factor into the future of his former network , even without returning cnn executives have privately expressed interest in stealing away a star from its financial news competitor , cnbc , like ron insana or david faber , for the moneyline position the problem is that all of cnbc s big stars are contractually bound to the network for some time one possibility that has emerged is a contractual swap between the two networks nbc has been eager to have mr dobbs appear as a regular presence on cnbc , but has been frustrated by a clause in his old cnn contract that prohibits him from appearing on a competing network through next spring in one possible series of events , cnn would allow mr dobbs out of his contractual obligations early in return for cnbc allowing one of its stars out of his or her contractual obligations early for cnn that is , if cnn can persuade one of them to join them mr faber s contract has less time left in it than do those of other contenders , and several executives said he was likely to be a person recruited by cnn a cnbc spokesman , paul capelli , said , we are not negotiating over any of our talents' contracts mr faber s agent , david fishof , had no comment nor did mr dobbs the only comment from cnn came from brad turell , the new executive vice president for communications at the turner broadcasting system , which oversees cnn all he said was , ever since stuart varney left 'moneyline' there has been lots of speculation about who might replace him jim rutenberg
baoding , china for more than three decades after it was founded in 1958 , the baoding no 1 paper mill seemed a model of chinese socialism if none of the workers got rich , at least they were provided decent housing medical care was nearly free and the growing force of retirees from the cityowned mill received livable pensions faithful workers , a number of whom gained coveted membership in the communist party , spent their careers at the mill and their children often entered it too this was a family affair , is how one worker described it today , the factory is dismantled its workers , onetime masters of the nation , are mostly destitute and feel betrayed they say the mill exemplifies some of the darker sides of china s economic transition the dismemberment of old state enterprises under shady circumstances and the virtual abandonment of lifelong employees many bettereducated chinese look forward eagerly to the opportunities provided by the growing private sector and by china s imminent entry into the world trade organization but millions of middleaged and older workers in state enterprises whose own schooling was often cut short by maoist turmoil have been left feeling castoff and afraid they include many in baoding , an aging industrial city of a million or so about 80 miles southwest of beijing where failed state industries and unemployment have proliferated in a chilling reflection of a community in despair , three elderly male retirees have committed suicide in the last three years , despondent because they became such a burden on jobless children with families of their own to support , workers said the case of this mill is by no means an isolated one , and the government s promises of training and even minimal income support have not been kept i never imagined it would get this hard , said chen yinglan , 72 , who wears the haunted look of someone whose world has fallen apart her husband worked for 40 years in state industries , proudly joining the communist party and rising to foreman at the baoding paper mill he died in 1994 , when the plant s fate still seemed uncertain , but she has rarely received the pension she is due last year , she said , she got a total of 6 a month to live on , and this year she has not received a penny like most of the former mill employees and their spouses , she lives in the increasingly decrepit company apartment blocks she shares her room with two cats and spends her days rummaging through garbage for sellable materials adding to her grief , her oldest son , laid off from the same mill , died in 1999 , perhaps from heart disease the ailment was never diagnosed , she says he had no money to see a doctor even as he began to feel sick her two other children have been laid off from other state enterprises , and they too have rarely received the stipends they are legally owed zhang shufen , 48 , who lives in the same compound , is not as hard up because she has kept her job at an outside store still , she fought back tears as she described how her husband who had been a foreman at the paper mill and a member of the communist party for 20 years was arrested last month for disturbing public order he really believed in socialism and would never do anything to hurt the party , she said of her husband , zhang xiaoying , who is 46 he had n't had any real work for 10 years and he took it hard i think he just got so outraged when he saw that they had beat up workers , and nobody cared , she said by way of explaining her husband s role in the angry demonstrations on nov 12 and 13 that led to his arrest she has not been able to visit him in jail and is waiting to hear his fate the paper mill was still doing a good business but was closed in 1992 to halt pollution of a nearby lake the national government provided 33 million for upgrading but that money disappeared , former managers say , and the mill s 1 , 036 employees , including 400 retirees , were left with nothing the plant never reopened and workers watched as valuable equipment was sold off , sometimes covertly and illegally by managers the laidoff workers received living allowances or pensions only sporadically and medical reimbursement stopped , leading to deaths and disabilities that perhaps could have been prevented in 1999 the city had the mill declared bankrupt and sold it to an enterprise that is also mainly owned by the same city government , but in addition sells shares on the stock exchange the new owner , the bao shuo corporation , put a new plastic piping plant on part of the land , and sold another large part to a commercial developer in return for 10 million and a share of the new development under the terms of the bankruptcy sale , bao shuo was supposed to meet past and future financial obligations to former employees and help them find new jobs only after years of bitter agitation , the workers say , did they receive a good share of the past money owed most of which went to pay off accumulated personal debts now the company , which appears to be having financial problems of its own , has refused to pay living allowances and pensions the bankruptcy was bogus , said a retired official of the mill all they wanted to do was to strip the mill of its land and assets under the very eyes of china s capital , our workers are living a subhuman existence photo chen yinglan , 72 , whose husband was a foreman at the paper mill in baoding and who died in 1994 , is reduced to rummaging through garbage for things to sell i never imagined it would get this hard , she

one telephone caller made the sound of a gun , leaving the message , bang ! bang ! bang ! on the answering machine dozens of invitations were extended to roman catholic churches and schools across queens , but only a handful were even acknowledged finding a priest from queens willing to give the opening invocation has been an impossible task tomorrow , for the second year in a row , a st patrick s parade that includes gay and lesbian marchers is to be held in the traditionally irish neighborhoods of woodside and sunnyside , queens the event was conceived last year as an inclusive alternative to the annual st patrick s day parade on fifth avenue in manhattan , which was beset by highly charged clashes over the exclusion of openly homosexual groups throughout the 1990 s but the organizers of the alternate parade have discovered that while queens may not be manhattan , they still must battle the same deeply held sentiment among many irishamerican catholics that homosexuality and st patrick do not mix the first posters for the parade , which will start at 43rd street and skillman avenue in sunnyside and run to 61st street in woodside , were hung only late last week because of fears that they would be ripped down when we moved to queens , we decided to build the kind of parade we were hoping for in manhattan , but it has been quite the challenge , said brendan fay , 42 , who is part of the parade s organizing committee and a founder of the lavender and green alliance , an irishamerican gay group that will march in the parade it seems like every halfhour something happens with this parade as the opposition really comes out mr fay and other members of the organizing committee , most of whom are not gay , have gone to great lengths to play down the event s gay and lesbian ties the theme is cherishing all of the children of the nation equally , a phrase taken from the proclamation of the irish republic in 1916 the lineup is expected to include scores of groups not associated with homosexual causes , including labor unions , native americans and postal workers also to be featured prominently will be a band from ireland , de jimbe , whose participation is being subsidized by the irish government it is a diverse parade , not a gay parade , and there is a big difference , said barbara ann heffernan mohr , 67 , a former nun and member of the organizing committee the naysayers have the right to their feelings , but hate is not going to win the day yet it is all but certain that the parade will be missing what most irishamericans , including both mrs mohr and mr fay , see as an essential element of a st patrick s parade the local representatives of the catholic church none of the parishes or catholic schools in queens have agreed to participate a branch of catholic charities in woodside had offered to serve tea and open its restrooms to the marchers , but the organization withdrew the offer last week harriet herman , the program manager for the charity in woodside , said that she had been unaware of a scheduling conflict when she extended the offer mr fay said he did not believe the explanation and blamed pressure spoken or unspoken from the diocese i was appalled when they changed their minds , said mr fay , who lost his job at a catholic high school in queens after marching with a gay group in the 1991 parade in manhattan people expect catholics to participate in a st patrick s parade while several individuals and clubs associated with parishes have expressed an interest in the parade , mr fay said , the only parish that has formally committed to sending a delegation is st paul the apostle church on manhattan s west side , which has a history of ministering to gays and lesbians because of the poor response by catholic groups , plans to hold an irish fair after the parade have been dropped a spokesman for the diocese of brooklyn , which includes the parishes in queens , said the diocese had not become involved in the debate the decision of a parish or school to take part in a parade is made at the local level , and the diocese supports any decision a parish or school makes , said the spokesman , frank de rosa the decision by most catholic institutions to stay away has been supported by some prominent irishamericans two republican party leaders in woodside recently issued a stinging condemnation of the event , labeling it an extremist gay and lesbian exhibition hopelessly and ignobly disguised as a celebration of irish culture the two republican officials , patrick hurley and ed coyne , appealed to groups marching in the parade to consider how hurtful their participation would be to irishamericans in the area we have a lot of young irishamerican families here in woodside and sunnyside , and the social agenda that this group is trying to promote obviously is at odds with the accepted family values , said mr hurley , president of the regular republican club in woodside if they want to exhibit or express their sexual identity , why not call themselves the irishamerican gay and lesbian parade , or the irishamerican hardline left parade \? because that is what they are
moses malone received the astonishing news from john lucas , who was nearly his teammate at the university of maryland he said , 'mo , you got drafted , ' malone recalled i said , stop playing , luke' no , you got drafted i'm serious for real \? for real that s cool , malone said let s go eat riding around college park , md , in lucas s cadillac 27 years ago , malone and lucas were about to grab a sandwich before scrimmaging i think i had on jeans and a tshirt , if i was dressed that nice , malone said on the day lefty driesell s terrapins lost a prize prospect , pro basketball gained its first teenager tonight at madison square garden , a few more youngsters will join a bustling new basketball world when commissioner david stern calls his name , tyson chandler , 18 years old , will trudge to the podium in one of two tailored suits hanging in his hotel closet , either blue or tan , i'm not sure yet , he said david rickey designed one of them michael jordan s personal trainer has already spent a lot of time with 18yearold eddy curry , another probable firstrounder kwame brown , who is projected to go no 1 , to the wizards , has turned to yoga to increase his flexibility they 've come a long way so far , so fast , that the landscape today is almost unrecognizable never mind their games , i do n't even know most of their names , malone said yesterday by telephone from his home outside of houston eugene moses malone is the first player in nba history to go from high school to a bronze bust in springfield , mass , without a stop at college he broke in with the utah stars of the american basketball association in 1974 , had very good years in houston , won a championship in philadelphia and did not retire until 1995 twenty seasons , 17 , 834 rebounds and 1 , 560 games later , he will be enshrined in the naismith memorial basketball hall of fame this fall the only player in the 2001 class these guys got it much better today than me , bill willoughby and darryl dawkins , malone said of the three most prominent players who skipped college in the 1970 s you used to have to average 30 points , 20 rebounds and 10 blocked shots it s gotten to the point where every kid who averaged 15 points and 10 rebounds is saying , 'why should i even go to college \? ' an agent , marc cornstein , agreed it s unfortunate , he said , but there is a feeling out there if a guy stayed in school , how good can he be \? no matter who drafts him , shane battier never regretted staying at duke the life experiences , the bonding i mean , you figure out how to get food at 3 o'clock in the morning when you 're locked out of your room and you do n't have a phone , he said not one of the teenagers who is expected to be drafted ahead of battier was a consensus national player of the year nor did any of them lead his team back from a 19point deficit in a final four game none of that matters anymore nba apprenticeships today begin at 14 and younger if you can hold court on a rugged playground at that age , the shoes , sweats and free trips materialize soon , the cattlecall summer camps begin , and you 're on your way it is not right or wrong it s just the way it is rodney white , the north carolinacharlotte freshman , who could be a top five pick , attended five high schools when asked why yesterday , he was very matteroffact each was a steppingstone , white said i did the public school as a freshman then i heard to get noticed in jersey , going to a catholic school is the thing to do one of my assistants there knew about mount zion , which is a basketball factory in north carolina i just looked at each one as taking another step malone is not in favor of a proposed age limit , no matter how oldschool he sounds and however noble stern s intentions may seem , malone said he understood the economics and marketing involved he wants to make sure college ballplayers get picked first , he said without a working agreement or compensation , the ncaa has been marketing the nba for four decades , helping michael jordan and magic johnson and shaquille o'neal morph into popculture icons but now the rules have changed , and the class of 2001 is much like other recent draft classes a group of mostly unknown and unproven youngsters mixed in with a few talented foreigners and the occasional senior tonight stern will smile and shake the hands of some of the very players he does not want in his league for at least another two years this could be one of the greatest bigman drafts in history , but no one has heard of any of these players next to some draftees , battier sounded like a 10year veteran i might give them some oldman advice real quick , he said , laughing like , 'tuck in your shirt' or something if they want to go out and institute an age limit for just this year , i 'll go out and carry a banner i'm for that asked what he drove around as a senior in high school , he said proudly , a 1982 powderblue chevrolet celebrity the best car i ever had chandler and curry have been driving cadillac escalades , custom sportutility vehicles , for a while everyone in this draft has an escalade , curry said , as if it came with the league s rookieorientation program it s the newest , hottest car curry , the 6foot11 , 285pound senior from thornwood high in south holland , ill , said he knew a little about malone he was a pretty good player after the smiles around the table emerged , he corrected himself he was a great player , he said in 1974 it was extremely unusual for a player to go straight from high school to the nba but since kevin garnett was drafted in 1995 , 11 high school players have been taken in the first round today it s commonplace today moses malone would not have had to hitch a ride to eat lunch in john lucas s noisy cadillac the hall of fame inductee would have had an escalade months ago
six weeks after the twin towers collapsed , the companies and organizations feared to have sustained the greatest losses of life have completed their official count of their missing and presumed dead but the total , which includes those lost by cantor fitzgerald , the new york fire department , the more than 165 diners and staff at windows on the world , as well as the passengers on the two planes , comes to only 2 , 405 even when the unofficial and singledigit losses suffered by 135 other companies at the world trade center are added , as well as a group of victims not connected to any particular company , the total dead in the disaster only reaches about 2 , 950 , according to a count by the new york times that figure , sure to change in the days to come , is nonetheless about 1 , 800 fewer than the list of the dead and missing kept and updated daily by the city , which as of tuesday stood at 4 , 764 city officials , who have lowered their number by about 500 over the last three weeks , refuse to offer projections on a final number as they continue to identify bodies , confirm deaths and sift through duplications and errors but explaining this still yawning discrepancy a month and a half after sept 11 has become increasingly difficult for the new york authorities involved , as news organizations , government agencies and officials from the american red cross and new jersey create their own lists of losses for some , including relief officials and researchers studying the disaster , the lingering puzzle of the numbers of dead and missing raises the question of whether the final total of the dead could be much closer to 3 , 000 than the once anticipated highs of 5 , 000 to 6 , 000 , figures that in many ways have taken hold in the public consciousness where are these people \? asked luis garcia , the american red cross administrator in charge of the grants being given to families of victims it is a question that many walk around carefully , because no one precisely knows what the historical total will be , and also because many are not inclined to risk being perceived as viewing a lower figure as some kind of victory to be sure , many people who died in and around the center bystanders , visitors , undocumented day laborers or deliverymen are not apt to quickly show up on anyone s formal list and not all of the hundreds of businesses that operated in and underneath the towers might have publicly issued their list of the dead but no one involved in the process of accounting for the dead the new york police department , and the port authority of new york and new jersey knows of some additional company based at the world trade center that is likely to produce another significant number of losses , much less anything on the scale of the hundreds lost by cantor fitzgerald or marsh mclennan there has also been no report of a large tour or other organized group of visitors that would number in the hundreds and given the considerable success before the collapse of the towers in evacuating the ground level of the trade center complex and the concourses below , there have been no indications that hundreds of people died who just happened to be passing though the area in new jersey , officials first feared that the state might have lost 1 , 500 residents , or even more but state officials today say that their official list of those from new jersey dead or missing in the attacks stands at 525 it is possible that the casualties are fewer , said rae hutton , a spokeswoman for donald t difrancesco , the acting new jersey governor from the start , the city has collected all reports of possibly missing people and taken them seriously and since then , while its working number has fluctuated wildly , the new york police department has worked to confirm cases and rule out duplications and errors that effort in recent weeks has sliced the number of dead and missing from 6 , 700 to just below 4 , 800 but throughout , citing privacy among other concerns , the city has said that it will not release the list until its work is completed , and officials will not guess when officials have even denied their list to relief groups eager to get money to confirmed victims as long as the process is under way , the numbers are going to be refined on a daily basis , said thomas antenen , deputy police commissioner our primary goal is not to be fast it is to be accurate any counts outside the official police department tally may be inherently flawed , mr antenen said , because no one has accumulated information on the missing from as many sources as the city or had 200 police officers dedicated to confirming the accuracy of this list several weeks ago , officials said that while the work was still under way , they felt they were closing in on a final count , putting the likely total of deaths between 4 , 500 and 5 , 000 the city s count is still within that range , but officials are not sure that it will remain there the new york times , the associated press and usa today each have lists that show totals in the 2 , 600to2 , 950 range for people missing or dead from the trade center attacks , including the 157 on the two planes the ap and usa today have used a variety of sources to arrive at their totals , from company lists to obituaries to news accounts but none of these news organizations have accumulated a total count that gets near to the city police department s tally it has seemed to be odd , said anthony debarros , a computer database editor at usa today , who is helping maintain the newspaper s count i do n't want to discount the possibility that there were large numbers of people who were just visiting or working in the building that day , or people like carpenters or electricians but still , even so , it is hard to understand where they are going to come from to reach the numbers the city is reporting some of the reductions that have occurred on the list have resulted from more thorough accountings by companies that lost a large number of employees aon , for example , feared for weeks that it had lost 200 employees , but upon completion of its staff review , that number now stands at 176 the american red cross , which is giving checks to families of victims , figured that it would hear from most of the families but at least so far , it has only processed 2 , 563 cases from the new york attacks steven stehr , a professor of political science at washington state university , who is studying the process of counting the missing and the dead , said that while there is typically great emphasis placed on exactly totaling the numbers of dead in major disasters , it may not be possible in new york city police officials say that no one should underestimate them what will allow them ultimately to arrive at an accurate number will be oldfashioned police work , culling through the final numbers of unconfirmed deaths by sending out detectives to root out any possible mistakes or even fraud everyone wants to have the lowest number possible , mr antenen said chart the count number , as of yesterday , of people reported dead or missing as a

cheyenne , wyo , may 31 the first thing jack miller did to offset rising electricity bills at his spacious cowboy theme store , wyoming home , was to replace all the 150watt and 250watt bulbs with fluorescent lighting next , he said , the basement boiler goes in favor of a forcedair heating system , a 15 , 000 changeover that could save him 1 , 000 a month throughout the west , not just in california , record energy costs are squeezing family and business budgets of millions of people like mr miller mr miller s recent bills for wyoming home have soared as high as 2 , 200 a month from a previous peak of 1 , 400 but the annoyance over soaring energy costs here is magnified by a glaring paradox wyoming has so much coal , natural gas and uranium reserves that gov jim geringer , a republican , recently told congress that the state could match the energy output of the opec nations for the next 41 years it s not a rare observation on the part of our customers , bryce freeman , the leading rate analyst for the wyoming public service commission , said people look out their windows and see 15 drilling operations , and they 're still paying some of the highest rates in the nation the cause of that incongruity is simple , energy officials say , and it is one reason energy prices in many other parts of the west are expected to rise for several more years before they stabilize the electricity grid in wyoming cannot carry any more electrons , they say new lines must be strung or existing lines improved the state expects to gain perhaps four new power plants in the next few years , but far more critical , governor geringer said , is adding high voltage lines to carry more electricity generated by the state s oil , gas and coal reserves wyoming has none of the 500 kilovolt lines that loop through the pacific northwest south into california , then east into arizona this means that wyoming s lines play a limited role in supplying energy to the points of greatest need , because most can carry only 230 kilovolts but plans for more transmission lines remain largely in the talking stage wyoming s own energy demands and operations are limited its population of about 490 , 000 is the smallest of any state energy companies in wyoming export about 80 percent of what they produce , sending natural gas , oil , uranium and windgenerated electricity to 32 other states we have even more energy supplies than texas , alaska or venezuela , said mr geringer , who supports the bush administration s policy of developing more domestic fuel sources and building new plants and lines to carry the energy to market much more energy lies dormant , as wyoming , through a new energy commission , contemplates ways to attract investors to build more power plants and new transmission lines to help supply the growing demands in other states running a highvoltage spur from wyoming into central california would start a domino effect of benefits throughout the region , mr geringer said he believes that by helping satisfy the demand in california and other populous regions , generators could wean themselves from the expensive spot market for electricity and sign more longterm contracts , which would help stabilize prices all across the west , including wyoming only by adding energy to the total grid can an individual state draw more energy for its own growing demands environmentalists in wyoming and elsewhere generally oppose the solutions proposed by mr geringer and the bush administration they urge conservation , rather than construction , as the best approach to lowering energy costs but mr geringer and other officials insist that conserving energy is only a small part of the longterm solution , which they say must include developing new energy supplies to bring prices down and keep them down for now , that offers little solace to many wyoming residents , like mike straw , of pine bluffs , who is a planner for vae nortrack , a railroad company eating lunch today at the diamond horseshoe cafe , mr straw said his residential electricity bills had doubled , to about 100 a month , which meant he had to postpone buying a van for his family , which includes five children , to replace his 1976 model i feel victimized , he said we used to have among the absolute lowest rates in the country i do n't think there are any shortages i guess it s just easier to let wyoming suffer like many other hotel owners around the west , paul smith , who operates the 260room hitching post inn here , has begun to pass the rising energy costs to customers in a 4anight surcharge to cover a 7 , 000 jump in his monthly electricity bills a similar increase is expected next january , but mr smith said he had not decided whether to pass that on he fears it might drive away business at her small general store not far from the hitching post , linda romero does not have the luxury of passing on her energy costs , which have surged to 400 a month , from 125 she now sells only small , inexpensive items after the increase forced her to close a building she used for selling furniture and antiques it was costing her too much for heating and light , ms romero said next to go , she said , may be the cart she uses to cook hot dogs and mix slushy drinks standing on the sidewalk out front , she said wistfully that the simulated wild west gunfights staged daily for tourists , starting this weekend , might attract some business i sure hope things get better , she said , looking into the distance if not , next year i might not be here photo linda romero , who runs a store in cheyenne , wyo , has seen her energy costs rise to 400 a month , from 125 she closed a building in which she sold furniture and antiques because it was too costly to heat and light \( kevin moloney for the new york times \)
washington , nov 3 four weeks after the united states began its military campaign to unseat the taliban in afghanistan and to destroy osama bin laden s terrorist network , there is an increasingly vigorous debate about whether substantial numbers of american combat troops will be needed to seal the victory in afghanistan in congress , some lawmakers say the pentagon s strategy of relying on the opposition northern alliance in afghanistan , bombing around the clock , and mounting sporadic raids by american , and eventually british , commandos is all well and good but unlikely to guarantee a decisive win i am glad that the pentagon has not thrown us troops in willynilly , said senator max cleland , a decorated vietnam war veteran and a prominent member of the senate armed services committee we have been extremely cautious in hoarding our precious personnel resources and that is wise and good but ultimately to obtain our objectives we will have to use ground forces this view has not been embraced by defense secretary donald h rumsfeld or the military officers who brief reporters they have been careful not to exclude a substantial ground force but are clearly holding out the hope that it will not be needed but it is a refrain that can be heard from some senior army officials as strategy and tactics are debated at the pentagon these are still early days for the complex american campaign , and there is no need to rush to a decision on ground troops the steady and patient application of force that mr rumsfeld has touted may yet pay off , particularly if mr bin laden or mullah muhammad omar , the taliban leader , slip up and are caught by allied special forces or in the cross hairs of an american gunship friction , the inevitable mistakes or complications of war identified by karl von clausewitz , the celebrated prussian military strategist , affects both sides but just as the nato nations during their 1999 war with yugoslavia began arguing about the need for ground troops even as they sought to deliver a knockout blow from the air , the ground troops debate about afghanistan is intensifying the debate turns on the pentagon s threepart strategy the american military is beginning to work with the northern alliance to put pressure on the taliban from the north it is also using small groups of commandos to take the fight to the taliban and terrorist leaders , and it is carrying out day and night bombing raids none of these elements are decisive alone the northern alliance is a loose coalition that has yet to demonstrate it is capable of fighting as a disciplined and wellcoordinated force its operations may be hampered by the winter , which is harsher in the northern part of afghanistan because the alliance is dominated by ethnic uzbeks and tajiks it will not be embraced by the pashtun , afghanistan s dominant ethnic group american and british special forces can be pivotal , providing the united states obtains good intelligence on the whereabouts of mr bin laden and the taliban leadership , which is a big if as for bombing , it was mr rumsfeld himself who proclaimed that afghanistan lacks a large number of highvalue targets in essence , the pentagon s calculation is that the combination of these elements will fracture the taliban , assuming the united states is prepared to keep up the campaign for many months and even years this week , mr rumsfeld gave a hint of just how much time might be required , invoking comparisons from world war ii consider some historical perspectives , he said after the dec 7 , 1941 , attack on pearl harbor , it took four months before the united states responded to that attack with the doolittle raid in april of '42 it took eight months after pearl harbor before the us began a land campaign against the japanese , with the invasion of guadalcanal in august of 1942 the us bombed japan for three and a half years , until august 1945 , before they accomplished their objectives but the critics say the united states cannot drag out the campaign , especially since there are already protests by muslim leaders in pakistan and other cooperative islamic states i do not think we have years , senator cleland , who has close ties to senior army officers , said in an interview we ca n't put those countries on the ropes for that long instead , he says the united states should be thinking about using helicopterborne air assault units or paratroopers in afghanistan this would entail using thousands of army troops , which would have the firepower that small units of special operations forces lack it could also involve marines , 2 , 200 of whom are currently off the pakistan coast the purpose would not be to occupy the country , but to seize bases temporarily and then carry out attacks to root out the taliban and the terrorist network , al qaeda this does not necessarily mean having four divisions up on the line , sweeping across the line of departure and triggering every mine in afghanistan , said senator cleland it means airborne or air mobile forces along with special operations it may mean airdrops or vertical envelopment to hold key points of terrain some united states army officers agree the sooner conventional forces are introduced , the sooner we will have a favorable outcome , said one army official conventional forces are needed to root out the taliban and exploit the full power of precision weapons senator john mccain , the arizona republican , has made similar arguments , saying the pentagon seems to be waging a war with one hand tied behind its back but this would mean additional american casualties haunted by the ghosts of vietnam , it is far from clear that the majority of lawmakers agree the white house has been wary it has not ruled out the use of major ground units , the mistake president clinton made early in the kosovo conflict and which he later moved to reverse but the bush white house has been hesitant to commit itself to using them last week , andrew card , president bush s chief of staff , was asked by nbc news if the united states was prepared to dispatch a significant number of ground troops his answer was brief but spoke volumes well , let s not go there yet , mr card said

shandon anderson could laugh yesterday but it was not so amusing on tuesday night when he endured a miserable knick debut at madison square garden , or even in the locker room after the game when teammates perused the stat sheets and offered some subtle jibes a couple of guys afterward were asking , 'you make a shot \? ' anderson said with a smile after the knicks' workout at sunypurchase you 're going to get that you 've got to take it it is the price that anderson had to pay for his performance against the washington wizards wanting to make a good first impression with a packed house , a huge news media contingent and an international television audience , anderson , a sixyear swingman , found himself in a nightmare scenario besides assuming the task of having to defend michael jordan in the first game of his comeback , anderson had an 0for5 shooting night that might have even been worse than the numbers indicate all five shots , four of which came from 3point range , were wide open , the kind that gets the crowd to hold its breath by the time the fifth miss came , the exhale was part of a loud jeer i am waiting to get out there and get in the knicks' book , anderson said you want that first one you want to get off the slide some way but that s just it , mentally , you 've got to push through that i'm still waiting for my first basket going into the second game i would have loved to have got it last game but you know , i 'd rather learn from a win than a loss if i 'd gone out and shot 0 for 5 in a loss , i 'd have been angry but in terms of us winning , i feel like i can learn anderson s nerves can be explained by both the assignment of focusing on jordan and trying to prove himself to the new york crowd with howard eisley stuck on the bench for the time being , anderson is the only player the knicks have to show for the deal that sent glen rice to houston this summer anderson inherited rice s role as the backup behind latrell sprewell and allan houston , but anderson , a career 474 percent shooter , displayed none of rice s shooting touch it was just rushing , not taking your time , anderson said you want to produce , and when things do n't go as well as you want the first time , it s just a matter of settling down everything else was fine i knew my defensive assignments i just think the shots did n't fall i did n't use my skills to my advantage i just stayed out on the perimeter whereas i should have been putting the ball on the floor a lot more i started settling for the outside shots but they were good shots , so it s just a matter of stepping up and knocking them down when i do take them anderson was not alone in the openinggame troubles clarence weatherspoon , another new acquisition , struggled through a 1for7 shooting night , but at least he was able to pull down eight rebounds in 25 minutes the thing is , any time you come into a new situation there is an adjustment period , weatherspoon said i did n't expect to come out and shoot 5060 percent right off the bat but i did expect to come out , work hard , rebound the ball , have a good rebound ratio for the minutes played i did that , but the shooting is going to come around the next chance for anderson and weatherspoon comes in charlotte tonight expect the first basket from anderson to be accompanied by a smile , or at least a sigh of relief
southern pines , nc , sept 25 this is as placid and pretty a town as anyone could imagine , complete with stately old homes , antique shops , a store that sells homemade fudge and an ice cream parlor across from the clapboard train station people here say they believe it is also home to some of america s most fearsome commandos more than a few of these soldiers have disappeared in the days since the terrorist attacks on new york and the pentagon no one knows for sure where they are , but neighbors guess that some belong to the elite special operations unit called delta force , and that they have made their way to places near afghanistan delta force is thought to be based at fort bragg , just a few miles down the road chris musto , a college student who works at a local cafe , said some of his regular customers had suddenly stopped showing up one guy i used to see all over the place , mr musto said i saw him at the bar , at the gas station , at the grocery store but i have n't seen him since all this started , or even his truck others have also noticed unexplained disappearances here there s a group of younger people who used to come in late at night who are n't around anymore , said patrick o 'donnell , owner of o 'donnell s pub , a popular tavern who these soldiers are and where they have gone will always be a matter of speculation the army does not release information about delta force or even acknowledge its existence asked if it trains at fort bragg , a spokesman for the army s special operations command , sgt amanda glenn , replied , we do not comment on that unit many people around here , however , not only say that delta force is based at fort bragg but take it as a point of pride some say that over the years , many of its members have gravitated to idyllic southern pines i'm sure there are delta force people here , said joe monroe , manager of the local bookshop this is a place that gives you a relaxed feeling that s probably something they need after all the time they spend practicing the awful things they do army publications do not mention delta force , but for a time in the 1990 s the army personnel web site had this notice delta is organized for the conduct of missions requiring rapid response with surgical applications of a wide variety of unique skills , while maintaining the lowest possible profile of us involvement col charlie a beckwith , who was the first commander of delta force , published a memoir in which he identified fort bragg as its headquarters colonel beckwith , who died in 1994 , wrote that its members were trained to put two head shots in each terrorist that makes them perfectly suited to the war the united states is now preparing to wage if men like osama bin laden are hiding in remote caves or underground bunkers , military experts say , no one is more likely to overpower them than the commandos of delta force they do not serve warrants and they do not make arrests , said eric haney , who says he served with delta force for eight years and who now lives in georgia their job is to kill people we want killed that makes them ideal for the situation our country is facing right now at this moment , i suspect a lot of them have already been prepositioned in places that are a lot closer to afghanistan than they are to the east coast of the united states military historians say that delta force was created in 1977 after a series of terrorist attacks in various parts of the world , including the murders of olympic athletes in munich those who want to join the unit face a grueling selection process it includes living for days without food in hostile terrain and training with weapons including bamboo sticks and flashbang grenades that temporarily blind and stun adversaries according to colonel beckwith s memoir , successful applicants are audacious , freethinking individuals who can be at times extremely patient and at other times extremely aggressive delta force is believed to have fewer than 2 , 000 members that is a small fraction of the 30 , 000 men and women on active duty with all special operations units , among them rangers , navy seals and special forces , who are sometimes called green berets officers close to delta force say that several hundred members of other elite military squads apply to join each year only a few dozen are ultimately accepted unlike other elite units , delta force commandos are trained to operate in small squads or even alone they may dress as they please , wear their hair as long as they please and make decisions in the field that normal soldiers may not these are trained killers , said daniel goure , a former defense department official who is now a senior fellow at the lexington institute , a policy research group based in virginia they 're just right for the kind of tactical operation we 're looking at , like going into a cave or bunker network full of armed people and making sure none of them get out alive they 're perfect for taking out bin laden and all the people around him because delta force operates in great secrecy , no outsider knows the names of its members , much less where they live many members do not even tell their families the name of the unit to which they belong but people in southern pines cannot help noticing that something here has changed people you used to see , you do n't see anymore , a waitress at mac s restaurant said today they 're here one day and just gone the next one of the absent may have been the anonymous parishioner at st anthony s roman catholic church who last week wrote a note in the prayer book requesting blessings for the military and our families as we obliterate evil at the stationery store , carol sylverstein , who works behind the counter , says she assumes that some people who live here are military commandos but prefers to think of them simply as people who shop and go to church and bring their kids to school just like anyone else you hear words like 'delta' and you know more or less what s behind it , but to us , these men as just part of our community , ms sylverstein said now they 're off doing something we ca n't even imagine
the last several years have been difficult for those seeking to rent large blocks of office space in a single building in manhattan yet getty images , which calls itself the world s biggest provider of photographs and other visual materials , is moving its approximately 500 new york employees from seven scattered locations into almost 225 , 000 square feet in a 17story building in tribeca in a further twist , the space had not been listed with brokers or otherwise advertised for rent the space is on the fourth and fifth floors in a triangular , 11 millionsquarefoot building , at 75 varick street , renamed 1 hudson square getty images has also acquired 36 , 000 feet more across the street , in adjoining buildings at 1216 vestry street and 200 hudson street getty images also has an option on an additional 72 , 000 square feet of space on the third floor at 1 hudson square , effective at the end of january 2002 , but meantime , since its consolidation did not require as much space as it thought , it has put its 73 , 000 square feet on the sixth floor on the market founded in london in 1995 but based in seattle since 1999 , getty images at first wanted 35 , 000 square feet for a new york office but it acquired five new york companies scattered across seven locations in manhattan in the last six years , and its space requirements soared the new york companies include the image bank and the visual communications group , previously getty s two biggest competitors getty s search and negotiations took more than a year before the final lease was signed last april it took time , effort and determination to put it all together , said james meiskin , the president of plymouth partners , which represented the new york real estate operations of getty images , because it involved consolidating the seven getty locations , and the landlord had to buy out and relocate 13 companies that occupied the space that getty moved into because none of that space was on the market , mr meiskin said he and tim kucha , a director of plymouth partners , had to convince the building s landlord that it was worth many millions of dollars for it to negotiate the early end of the 13 leases getty s lease , for 15 years with options , is valued by real estate executives at 175 million to 200 million getty s new landlord is trinity real estate , a unit of the parish of trinity church , which owns extensive property in the hudson square area like many other landlords , in the last several years trinity has not been renewing the leases of its lowestpaying tenants so that it can replace them with higherpaying ones simultaneously , it is upgrading its buildings , including a revamping of at least 1 million at 1 hudson square most of trinity s lowestpaying tenants in recent years have been printers or related businesses all but a few of the 13 companies that have been moved from 1 hudson square , or soon will be , were affiliated with the printing industry none had their leases ended involuntarily , said stuart a christie , a former real estate lawyer who has been leasing offices for trinity for three years in addition , mr christie said , five of the 13 who accepted buyouts moved into other trinityowned buildings in the surrounding area mr meiskin , mr kucha and marshall j cohen , a lawyer with the manhattan firm of stadtmauer bailkin who represented getty images , each said that trinity was as concerned about honoring its existing contracts as about the additional rent it would get from getty they were terrific , mr cohen said of trinity they 've worked hard to turn the building into a beautiful piece of real estate , and they were honorable in our dealings mr meiskin contrasted the trinity negotiation with an earlier one on behalf of getty images involving 68 , 000 square feet in a building on eighth avenue we had a handshake with the owners and told them to prepare leases , he said but after we agreed on terms , we learned the owners decided to lease it to others for more money while the search for space and subsequent negotiations were long and complicated , getty images had no complaints jonathan klein , the company s cofounder and chief executive , said it was well worth the wait , adding cheerfully moving is always complicated show me one that is n't the company s other cofounder , as well as president , is mark getty , a grandson of j paul getty , the oil magnate , who died in 1976 getty images has 2 , 600 employees consolidating its new york operations meant that certain companies that getty images acquired had to go through more than one move before settling in at hudson square but we took the view that it was important to consolidate , mr klein said , important financially , culturally and for an easier flow of expertise having acquired companies in many lands with many cultures , he added , when we put people together geographically , we find they have more in common than they think
friends call from out of town and say , so apart from that , how are you \? i tell them that , generally speaking , there is no apart from that as on a recent friday morning i was boarding , reluctantly , the c train for chambers street reluctantly , because i do n't like subways , never did i like ground level but i was late for jury duty downtown , and i live uptown , and a cab would have been too costly and a bus too slow so at 86th street and central park west , i went underground the train was not crowded beside me a preppylooking fellow sipped coffee opposite , a young woman smiled into space , a hundred miles away a big , heavy man was lost in his walkman , head subtly bopping to the beat others were reading newspapers , their headlines reporting the california governor s warning that terrorists might soon attack a major bridge we drew into the west fourth street station the doors opened suddenly , an uptown train roared past us making a horrendous noise , like an airraid siren reverberating through the tunnel the preppy cried , oh , god ! then jumped up and lunged onto the platform the young woman screamed and followed him i followed her the man with the walkman barreled out , shouting , what \? what \? and others came after we stood there for maybe 10 seconds , an eternity , nobody making for the exits just standing there , paralyzed dominos what had panicked me , made me leap up and take that insensible plunge through the door , was not the screech of the passing train , for in fact it may not have been much louder than passing train noises that i had heard before it was the preppy s reaction aha , he is terrified he must know something i do n't all this racing along my synapses , light years ahead of consciousness and if he in his flagrant fear is that desperate to get out , i 'd better get out too so i got the noise stopped there was a sort of communal exhalation , a grimacing in implicit acknowledgment of what perhaps none of us could have articulated , a stew pot of embarrassment , relief , grief , rage rage at the faceless other and shame , i think , for ourselves , for what we had allowed , in that moment , to become of ourselves we shuffled back into the car , back to our original places , like schoolchildren after a fire drill we sat halfgrinning at each other and shaking our heads , as in can you believe this \? can you believe us \? the cup shook in the young man s hand he said , is it always that loud \? i said i was n't sure he asked the woman across the way , do you think it s always that loud \? and she said oh , no never a man standing nearby said it always sounds just like that when the express goes through we 're just a little more conscious of it now silence then the young man switched to sotto voce i was at the world trade , he said to me , so anything , it just sets me off , i just go oh , my what does one say \? condolences on being there congratulations on being here you worked there \? no i was at a business meeting where \? how high up \? rubbernecking , post facto the fifth floor so you just yeah right out but now any little thing he sighed i just moved here from san francisco since it happened , i 've been thinking i might move back but now we 're hearing about those bridges so i do n't know he laughed i laughed the woman across the aisle joined in and said , are n't we the jumpy ones now it was chambers street it felt as if no more than three minutes had elapsed since west fourth street i rose , told my neighbor good luck and moved to the door i looked over to signal goodbye to the young woman too but she was again smiling into space the man with the walkman was hopping again , and the passengers with newspapers were all , as far as i could tell , back to the morning s news drawing \( tom bloom \)
three years ago , white plains was a city in decline the tax base had been dropping for more than a decade , and the office vacancy rate was more than 30 percent the highest in the world for cities of its size you could fire a cannon in the downtown area at night and not hit anybody , said joseph m delfino , who became mayor in 1998 so the mayor and his aides looked for a model to help guide their efforts to bring the city back to life they found one 15 miles northeast , in stamford the connecticut city , after all , had been in similarly dire straits only a few years earlier , with its vacancy rate close to 30 percent , and the streets around its gleaming office towers empty and forbidding but it had risen from the ashes with amazing speed , in part by building new highrise residential towers and adding dozens of restaurants and bars in the downtown area we looked very closely at what they did in their downtown , said paul wood , an aide to mr delfino the renewal plan white plains arrived at rooted in new housing and entertainment in the downtown area is straight out of the stamford playbook there were other models , mr wood said , but stamford was the clearest , because it was so close and because its history has so paralleled that of white plains although stamford is much larger 377 square miles as opposed to 99 the two cities' downtown areas are of comparable size their demographic makeup , median income and daytime population roughly 200 , 000 are virtually the same both cities are viewed as the center of their respective counties , and both fall under the shadow of new york city , from which they began to draw corporations looking for safer and more suburban settings starting in the 1950 s and 60 s both underwent a similarly dramatic urban renewal , bulldozing large sections of their downtown areas and rebuilding them with vast office towers in the 1970 s and 80 s both built enclosed malls at roughly the same time and those malls helped destroy the existing retail outlets on the city s main retail street , which was known , in both cases , as little fifth avenue both cities have also been held up as examples of what the architecture critic joel garreau has called the edge city , a hastily built agglomeration of office towers and parking garages designed to accommodate the needs of cars more than pedestrians but they also illustrate the ways city planners have tried to revitalize what had been viewed as cold , hostile settings on that front , even a casual visitor can see that stamford has come further than white plains on a weeknight after 8 , white plains is virtually empty , its audible pedestrian signals designed for the blind chiming eerily in the silence in the heart of the downtown , the old macy s building remains vacant , and across from it are discount stores like the 1 limit there are few young people on the streets , and none of the sleek coffee bars that have become almost ubiquitous elsewhere it is as though the city s clocks had stopped in the last recession and never started again by contrast , stamford s streets at night are often filled with patrons from dozens of new downtown restaurants , bars and the city s two multiscreen movie theaters stamford has also gained more than 1 , 000 units of residential housing downtown over the last five years , with 2 , 500 more units planned and there are new security and sanitation workers to keep the streets safe and clean the city s office vacancy rate is now about 7 percent white plains remains at 134 percent , though it has less than half of stamford s 15 million square feet of office space , said frank tomasulo , a senior vice president at cb richard ellis , a real estate brokerage firm that comparison might seem humbling to a city that has often been viewed as stamford s rival but competition between the cities has mostly been mythological , said edward steinberg , who worked as a planner for white plains and then for stamford over three decades the notion of competition between white plains and stamford has been for the most part in the minds of third parties , he said they were just doing similar things at similar times both cities were founded in the 17th century , and grew slowly over the years white plains , which has been the seat of the westchester county government since 1778 , was mostly residential , with some commerce and the county office buildings , while stamford was a manufacturing town , shipping pianos , bicycles , locks and other goods to new york city from its canal street docks by 1960 , when they decided to participate in the federal urban renewal program , both cities encompassed a series of mostly wealthy residential neighborhoods surrounding a declining urban core in both cities , urban renewal drew opposition in white plains , the 138acre renewal zone the second largest in the country included the city s old commercial center and an old courthouse , parts of which dated to 1830 it also included slum areas and an old hotel called the honeymoon flats that was also a brothel , said alfred del vecchio , who served as the city s mayor from 1976 to 1994 , and has been a white plains resident since 1957 the stamford urban renewal zone had a similar variety of old homes
five years ago , michael a rebell found himself celebrating one of the greatest victories of his legal career with a knot in his stomach new york state s highest court , the court of appeals , had just ruled that a lawsuit filed by a tiny nonprofit group that he helped found , the campaign for fiscal equity , could continue the group was accusing the state of using a school financing formula that shortchanged schoolchildren in new york city of hundreds of millions of dollars a year in a common legal maneuver intended to save court time , the group s lawsuit had been combined with similar suits filed by the city of new york and its board of education but in its ruling , the court of appeals threw the city and the school board out of the case , finding that only individual parents , like the plaintiffs in the campaign s lawsuit , could sue the state the campaign would face the mammoth task of suing the state on its own i remember standing in our conference room with bob hughes , the group s only other lawyer , mr rebell recalled we were both scratching our heads and saying 'my god , what are we going to do now \? we 're going to have a huge trial against the state of new york' mr rebell said he sent out a legal sos to the city s major law firms what happened next was an anomaly several law firms expressed interest in handling the lawsuit , but in the end mr rebell chose simpson thacher bartlett because of its strong commitment to the case the firm assigned eight lawyers to the case and ended up donating 14 million in legal work and expenses the legal battle stretched over five years , ending with a sevenmonth trial two weeks ago , the tiny nonprofit and its large forprofit legal partner finally prevailed , winning a ringing , benchmark ruling that declared the state s financing formula deficient and discriminatory against minority students the firm s work is believed to be the largest single donation of pro bono legal representation in the city that is increasingly unusual in new york and other cities through the longest peacetime economic expansion in american history , the amount of pro bono work by new york s major law firms has risen slightly nationwide , pro bono work by major firms has plummeted i would hope this case would serve as a motivator for other firms , mr rebell said they see what can be accomplished for decades , government financing of nonprofit groups and pro bono work by private firms have helped provide legal services for those who cannot afford it , in many cases the working poor or the elderly involved in landlordtenant , pension or other disputes but in recent years , government cutbacks and a booming economy have resulted in an increased need for legal services at the same time , major firms have not increased their pro bono work there are a tremendous number of cases where people need lawyers and ca n't get them , said tanina rostain , a professor of legal ethics at new york law school there is a desperate need the healthy economy , she said , has overwhelmed firms with paying clients internet companies and soaring stock markets led lawyers to demand higher and higher salaries as a result , firms devoted resources to increasing earnings and froze or scaled back pro bono commitments the amount of pro bono work done by firms in new york city has risen only slightly in recent years , said william j dean , executive director of volunteers of legal services , a local nonprofit that encourages pro bono work several major law firms continue to take on major pro bono lawsuits against the city or state , he said debevoise plimpton helped sue the city over its policy of releasing mentally ill inmates from rikers island without a plan for continued treatment or housing davis polk wardwell is helping sue the state over its failure to raise pay rates for courtappointed lawyers for the poor since 1986 mr dean said that while some law firms and lawyers do large amounts of pro bono legal work , others do next to none a survey by the american lawyer magazine published last july found that the major city firms doing the largest amounts of pro bono work per lawyer in 1999 were debevoise plimpton paul , weiss , rifkind , wharton garrison fried , frank , harris , shriver jacobson and schulte roth zabel the cost of pro bono work can be small when compared with what major firms take in simpson thacher bartlett s 14 million donation over five years in the school case is dwarfed by its gross revenues in 1999 alone 434 million pro bono work also produces some benefits a commitment to it helps firms recruit lawyers , many of whom find charity work rewarding , and the work can generate good publicity mr rebell said simpson thacher bartlett s interest in his case stemmed from its chairman , richard i beattie mr beattie founded new visions for public schools , a local nonprofit group , and served on the board of education in the mid1980 s joseph f wayland , the partner who coordinates the firm s pro bono work , became the chief litigator in the case he grew so emotionally invested in it that he worked nights and weekends on the case and broke down in tears while delivering his closing argument at the trial mr wayland , 43 , said his devotion stemmed from his background and the simple unfairness of providing hundreds of thousands of children with an inadequate education an upper east side resident , he grew up attending public schools in norwich , conn , a depressed former mill town the son of an electrical engineer who built nuclear submarines in nearby new london and a mother who did charity work , mr wayland said he believed public schools are pivotal to american society growing up in a middle class environment , schools were a place that provided opportunities , he said schools were a vehicle for future success now a partner in a whiteshoe firm where senior lawyers routinely charge more than 500 an hour , he admitted that the city s public schools are not an issue in his life i send my children to private school i can pay for it , he said but in new york city , 99 percent of the people do n't have the choice that i have mr rebell , the campaign s lawyer , said he does not agree with the axiom that money buys justice he said his group might have won the case without its wealthy patron , but he conceded that the victory would not have been as big we never could have given the judge the solid record he had , he said , referring to the evidence presented at trial we never could have gotten a decision of this profundity , this magnitude and depth without them photos the lawyers who worked on the school financing case for the simpson thacher bartlett law firm were , from left , david e massengill , kenneth g crowley ,

rio de janeiro , june 20 nearly nine years ago , a military police riot squad swept into latin america s largest prison to quell a routine fight between rival gangs the result was what human rights groups and even the brazilian government itself describe as the worst massacre in the country s history , with at least 111 prisoners killed , most as they cowered in their cells after countless delays and much maneuvering , the officer who led the attack , col ubiratan guimaraes , went on trial today in s o paulo , charged with 111 counts of murder in a trial that had to be broken off last year because a juror was hospitalized , colonel guimaraes denied the charges his chief defense lawyer , vicente cascione , said then all my client did was order the troops to go into the prison and quell the riot if some individual policemen used excessive force , they are the ones , and not my client , who should be put on trial many of the nearly 120 riot troopers who stormed into carandiru prison on oct 2 , 1992 , with machine guns and dogs have also been charged with murder and are awaiting trial to many brazilians , the issues raised by the violence go far beyond the actions of colonel guimaraes and his men , throwing a spotlight on the brutality of the country s jails a forensic report that has been entered as evidence states that in all of the cells examined , the bullet trajectories indicate that the shooters fired from outside the cells contradicting colonel giumaraes , who says there was confrontation between the prisoners and police , the report adds there are no traces whatsoever of evidence showing that there was gunfire originating from within the cells jos andre de ara jo , a former prisoner who says he was able to survive the attack only by pretending to be dead , has appeared recently at events organized by brazilian human rights groups , reiterating findings that the prisoners had thrown knives and other weapons out the window and offered no resistance everyone had already surrendered , with their hands on their necks , and there were no arms , he said last week it was all very cowardly judicial proceedings were delayed in part because in 1994 colonel guimaraes was elected to the s o paulo state legislature , which gave him parliamentary immunity until 1998 this trial is expected to last about two weeks according to brazilian human rights groups , none of those involved have been expelled from the police for use of excess force in the carandiru attack or received disciplinary sanctions , and at least four senior officers have been promoted because of delays in the case , charges of assault with injury against 29 officers had to be dropped because the statute of limitations had expired eight others pleaded guilty to lesser charges in return for having their sentences commuted to community service since the 1992 attack , overcrowding and other problems at carandiru have only intensified , leading the state government to vow time and time again to close the prison and move its more than 7 , 000 inmates to more humane quarters in february , a rebellion among prisoners there spread to more than a score of other state prisons , and was once again put down by a special tactical team , this time with a death toll of less than 20 colonel guimaraes , who today runs a private security firm , has never indicated any remorse in the same circumstance , he said in an interview last week in o globo , a rio daily , i would comply with my duty all over again
hanoi , vietnam it looked like a done deal a quarter of a century after the war , vietnam and the united states were on the verge of an agreement that would close the circle a wideranging trade pact that would put them side by side on a path toward open and equal relations signed last july after four years of hard lobbying and gentle persuasion by washington , the highly detailed agreement amounts to confirmation of vietnam as a member of the global world that it had feared and resisted in the years after the war ended in 1975 it is the most important thing to happen since the end of the war , and it s really the basis for building a new relationship between the united states and vietnam , said virginia b foote , who heads the united statesvietnam trade council , a washington lobbying group but now , just at the moment when it was to be approved by congress , the agreement has stalled in washington , apparently a victim of vietnam s receding importance for the united states the agreement is still broadly supported in congress and is far from dead but its passage is imperiled by plans to include it in an omnibus trade package being prepared by the new administration that could take months or years to approve american officials who had made it the centerpiece of their policy here are mortified vietnamese are asking vexing questions about the reliability of washington as a partner and the value of its promises i'm being bombarded with their concerns , said ambassador pete peterson , who came to vietnam after diplomatic relations were restored in 1995 , the first united states envoy here since the war the concerns are shared by american business executives in vietnam who have been marking time , waiting for the gates to trade and investment to be opened fully none of us ever in our wildest dreams imagined that we would be in this place at this time , that the united states side would be slowing down the agreement that everyone worked so hard to accomplish , said greig craft , an american consultant and entrepreneur who has ridden the ups and downs of business relations here during the last decade vietnam has faithfully fulfilled its commitments to us but critics have kept raising the bar the fact of the matter is that vietnam went ahead and hung in there and did everything we asked them to do once again , the bar seems to have risen higher the broad trade package being put together by the united states trade representative , robert b zoellick , would bundle the vietnam agreement with several more difficult trade measures that would open the way to debate and opposition from lawmakers who want to include environmental and labor issues in any such deals , and from interest groups concerned about religious freedom the vietnam agreement is signed , sealed and packaged , ready for quick passage if , as part of an omnibus , it is opened for amendment , it would have to be renegotiated with hanoi , a significant delay in putting it into operation more talks would set back not just economic ties but also the development of postwar relations between vietnam and the united states , mr peterson said in an interview it s an agreement on trade , certainly , but it is , for this country and ours , much more than that , he said it is a normalization agreement it is the completion of the circle of the process , of which economics is the missing link a great deal has been placed in the hands of that document relative to whether our two countries are going to hold hands or hold each other at arm s length it is a very important document in stating that our two nations want to have relations , not only on trade the agreement is an unusually detailed blueprint for opening vietnam s economy , in return for the unfettered access to the united states economy that is enjoyed by most other nations it is the most comprehensive trade agreement ever negotiated , said ms foote , of the trade council , including chapters on investment , on intellectual property rights , on trade and services , banking , accounting , insurance , legal you name it it is basically a road map for economic reform for vietnam , touching on pretty much every aspect of their economy tom vallely , an expert on the vietnamese economy at harvard , said he believes that congress understands how important it is and will in the end vote separately to pass the bill vietnam must find a way to integrate itself into the world economy , he said , and the trade agreement is essential to support the reforms that are now taking place in vietnam we would be abandoning what we 've been trying to do for a decade of engagement with vietnam , and i do n't think the administration wants to do that if the package is not passed soon , he said , vietnam would look elsewhere to japan , to europe , even to a resurgent china for its trading partners but these would not substitute for the united states , the world s largest market economic reforms would be set back by slowing development of the private enterprise that is essential if vietnam is to phase out the unproductive stateowned enterprises that sap its economy , he added if it ca n't get a trade agreement , vietnam ca n't use the investment potential it has to join the world economy , mr vallely said it could drive vietnam closer to china in official statements , the vietnamese have begun to voice their exasperation , with the minister of trade , vu khoan , warning that vietnam might revoke special privileges that had been extended to american businesses pending ratification of the agreement responding to religious and human rights organizations in washington that have begun lobbying against the agreement , the communist party newspaper nhan dan said , this is a ridiculous and unwarranted action , which can only upset relations between vietnam and the united states americans who work in vietnam sound almost as aggrieved the point here , said fred burke , an american lawyer who has been in vietnam for a decade , is that having built up all this trust , we risk losing it all by saying , 'ok , vietnam is giving us all we asked for , but we are still not going to do what we told them we were going to do because there are other issues we want to resolve first' photo hanoi hoped a trade accord with washington would mean even more signs for american goods , but approval has stalled in congress \( associated press \)
every time i saw the footage of the world trade center towers collapsing , my heart sank afresh with them not because of the horror i felt over lives taken so brutally this seemed like melancholia how could i be mourning the loss of steel towers \? the other day i opened a scrapbook and found a snapshot of my parents carl and marie sferrazza on a winter day in 1969 in the background is the trade center , about as tall as it stood last week studying the picture , i realized that what i was feeling was nostalgia rather than melancholia it was n't about steel towers but about what they had seen for as long as i 've been conscious of my father , he was working on , or at , the world trade center a port authority architect , he was personally involved with the trade center as early as 1965 , recruiting potential tenants , creating and configuring space for them , then working with other architects and engineers to plan windows on the world i knew it simply as his work our family had been anticipating the trade center since that day in 1969 when my father took us to a reception where a model of the towers was unveiled even my little brothers marc and robert stopped running around long enough to cluster around the model two years later came a preview of the finished towers , at a sunday brunch typically , my father included us all , and we were put into jackets and ties , as if it were easter i had some idea that famous people might be there and , in eager search of them , purposefully lost my parents and rode the elevator up and down alone and promenaded over the lobby s purple carpet none of the guards questioned me , and i thought myself secretly matured i was 12 on mother s day 1976 , our family first dined at windows it had opened weeks earlier , and the staff doted on us because they knew our father windows was our special restaurant , where we took visitors and celebrated moments like the 1998 wedding of my brother christopher unlike the observation deck \( where you were set back from the edge \) , you could press your nose against the window and let your stare plummet to the street i preferred cloudy days , when the restaurant was like a dreamland , the windows snugly insulating us up in the air i got my first college summer job there , a short stint as a busboy as an avid history student , i was angry that my father would n't take us to philadelphia on july 4 , 1976 instead , he arranged to bring us up to one of the top floors to watch op sail , the parade of international ships through the harbor there was fear that the ship s cannons might blow out the windows , but we crammed into those tall , thin windowsills to watch although the ships were just little dots , i would have regretted missing it all many of the pictures show my 11monthold sister , maria , in a windowsill i held her arms as she tried to walk my father easily lured me from washington to new york on july 4 , 1986 , to attend the statue of liberty centennial celebration at the trade center on the observation deck i found myself comforting my mother after an upsetting incident as we looked down on battery park only later did it hit me that that i had spoken to her as an equal later , gazing at ellis island with my grandmother angie , i questioned her in detail for the first time about her feelings about coming to america she shrugged and piped up , it s best in america as late as 1993 , when my father was 62 , i 'd never considered his mortality that year , when i learned of the trade center bombing , i suddenly feared for his life years earlier , he 'd told us how the trade center could never topple we believed everything my father said after the bombing , he reaffirmed that the trade center would n't fall between his descriptions of smoke inhalation even after i found a stack of photographs he took , and asked about the ghoulish images of trade center workers on stretchers , he chuckled oh , it was a mock disaster staged back in 1978 i was most recently at the trade center in 1997 it marked the first time my siblings and i had organized an event together as adults , a surprise dinner for our parents' 40th wedding anniversary for the first time we 'd picked up the tab for them i now live in los angeles , my brother christopher in melbourne he , along with his wife , emilia , and their 1year old , olivia , were scheduled to depart there on sept 11 , en route to new york there may have been one more family outing to windows , little olivia marking the fourth generation of our family to experience the trade center their plane never left melbourne after the attack on sept 11 , my father , who lives in bayside , queens , remembered his many coworkers who were lost and , he said there are certain places , on the high spots of northern boulevard , where one could see the towers i avoid looking at the horizon entirely my family lost only a place of memories many others lost the person who created memories for them it is often said that some good can come from tragedy in this case , it is hard to see that yet somehow , as i close my scrapbook , my father now stands as tall as the towers once did photo marie and carl sferrazza at tower 1 , 1969

to the editor there are many lessons in your poignant and eyeopening none of the above series \( front page , may 20 and 21 \) , but surely one of them is that the private companies that take public money to administer highstakes tests can be as inefficient , unfeeling , unapproachable and devious as any public bureaucracy i hope that your series helps not only to stop the drift toward highstakes testing , but also to end the privatization of education programs and the outflow of public dollars to profitseeking corporations robert shaffer mechanicsburg , pa , may 21 , 2001 the writer is an assistant professor of history , shippensburg university
after president bush announced his decision to back limited federal financing of embryo stem cell research , responses came quickly from roman catholic bishops , who criticized it , and some prominent religious conservatives , whose views were considerably more mixed but in the weeks since the president s announcement on aug 9 , many major religious groups have yet to be heard from take the unitarianuniversalist association , perhaps the country s most liberal religious body we 're getting quite a number of calls and emails , requests and wishes for us to take a position , said the association s president , the rev bill sinkford the messages also reached the rev meg riley , director of the denomination s washington office i think they were concerned about who was monopolizing the debate and that our view , which is proscience , proresearch , was not heard , ms riley said one email message came from jim rice , an oklahoma city lawyer and a longtime unitarian i commented that other religious leaders had spoken out strongly , mr rice , who favors the research , said i pointed out that we had not but among unitarianuniversalists , power is vested at the grass roots , and official statements come from an annual assembly the assembly was in june , before attention focused on whether human embryos should be used in scientific research , and did not take up the subject mr sinkford said he was certain the assembly would do so next year the unitarianuniversalists are not alone in not having an official position the episcopal church , the evangelical lutheran church in america and the united methodist church do not have one either , yet even the church of jesus christ of latterday saints , whose only position so far has been that the issue warrants cautious scrutiny , has not reacted to mr bush s position reform jews , the presbyterian church \( usa \) and the united church of christ have taken nuanced positions generally favoring such research it is not unusual for religious organizations to take months or even years to write statements on social issues some groups , like muslims , hindus and buddhists , are so decentralized that no one can really claim to speak for all members those who speak on social issues tend to do so as individuals or as representatives of specific organizations none of this means that people of the various denominations and faiths are uninterested in the ethics of stem cell research in the last few weeks , it has become a topic of discussion among adult groups in some churches and synagogues , as well as in polls among american muslims within this landscape , conservative judaism is moving relatively quickly , and its rabbinical assembly expects to declare a position on jewish law and stem cell research this year it is something that rabbis want to know , said rabbi elliot n dorff , vice chairman of the conservative movement s committee on jewish law and standards shortly before mr bush announced his decision , rabbi dorff , rector of the university of judaism in los angeles , received a call from the committee s chairman , rabbi kassel abelson , who asked him to send a paper on stem cell ethics to other committee members for study rabbi dorff , a member of a bioethics commission that met at the white house in 1999 , had one on hand in it , he concluded that jewish law allowed support for stem cell research because it could serve a common good , combating disease after committee members send him their comments , the paper will be revised and adopted as the movement s standard on dec 19 in june , a month before conservative rabbis began their study , officials in the episcopal church created a task force to study the ethical , theological and legislative implications of the new genetics but any formal statement must probably await the next general convention , in 2003 meanwhile , priests like the rev william tully , rector of st bartholomew s church in new york city , are trying to help episcopalians think about the issue this month , father tully invited a professor of ethics and moral theology to speak to a gathering at his church on thinking ethically about 75 people attended to discuss how the christian tradition could help them ponder such issues as stem cell research , he said asked whether it mattered that the episcopal church had not yet come up with a statement , he said , my view is that the days when people were hanging on the pronouncements of a denomination if they ever did are passing muslims may lack a central governing body to offer an opinion on the ethics of stem cell research , but some prominent individuals , like dr maher hathout , a cardiologist who is spokesman for the islamic center of southern california , have offered a muslim perspective on the issue muslims regard abortion as wrong , but they also hold that life does not begin until the fertilized egg attaches to the womb s wall , dr hathout said he added that this would not preclude research on stem cells from in vitro fertilization that would otherwise be discarded still , ibrahim hooper , a spokesman for the council on americanislamic relations , an islamic advocacy organization , said he had not heard of any islamic authority ruling on stem cell research from the perspective of religious law the week that mr bush announced his decision , the evangelical lutheran church of america held its biennial churchwide assembly perhaps one of the bigger surprises of the stem cell debate has been the absence of a direct response to mr bush s stand from the denomination , of 51 million members but the lutheran assembly had much internal business before it , including electing a presiding bishop , deciding whether to add a provision to an ecumenical agreement and debating whether it should undertake a study of how lutherans should relate to gays and lesbians asked whether any discussion had taken place in the denomination about the need for a statement on stem cell ethics , james m childs jr , a professor of theology and ethics at trinity lutheran seminary in columbus , ohio , said , no concerted cry has come to my ears , at least
on a recent sunday morning , the 59th street a train platform was busier than normal for a rainy weekend families and a stream of raindrenched runners , fresh from the central park father s day race , were descending the stairs when they encountered a mysterious empty subway train that roared into the station , slowed and sped up again without taking on passengers annoyance turned to amazement when some in the crowd noticed that the train was an ancient dreadnought , something out of a time warp but what they saw was no apparition it was a brace of vintage 1927 dtype triplex cars that make up the nostalgia train one of several tours given by the new york transit museum in downtown brooklyn the train was headed to a turnaround spot uptown so it could return to 59th street and pick up passengers for a journey into the past i first took the nostalgia train several years ago when my wife gave me tickets for my birthday a longtime subway enthusiast , i confess that i am not above using a friend s children as excuses to visit the transit museum repeatedly after we moved from manhattan to brooklyn heights , a few blocks from the museum , i became adept much to my wife s dismay at steering unsuspecting visitors toward the exhibition it was during our first nostalgia trip that i realized i was n't alone in my passion arriving 15 minutes early , helen and i discovered a line of 300 people wrapped around the block there were a lot of children , sure , but a large portion of the crowd resembled the wisecracking , quickwitted eccentrics one finds in saul bellow novels the most arcane details about subway cars , routes and stations were bandied about with the goodnatured competitiveness of teenagers swapping baseball statistics i could barely contain myself when a young buffintraining lamented the passing of a subway line whose vintage made it doubtful that even his father would have been old enough to ride it this year s nostalgia train route begins at columbus circle and goes to the transit museum in the vacant court street subway station at the corner of boerum place and schermerhorn street in brooklyn after a onehour visiting stop at the museum , the train moves on through the heart of brooklyn and queens , over jamaica bay to rockaway park , the end of the line \( in other years , the destination has been coney island \) the nostalgia train s passengers had n't changed much since my last trip we had hardly pulled out of the 59th street station when i encountered a pair of diehard buffs , two hirsute middleage men wearing blue tshirts and caps that read metro , spelled out in officiallooking typeface one , howard dennis , is an engineer for the washington metro area transit authority , where his job is to make sure the third rail stays hot , he said he and his friend took an early morning amtrak train up from washington for the trip another buff named ken , a mustachioed electronics salesman in his mid30 s , displays the digital video camera he 'll use to record the entire trip from his hardwon perch at the front of the head car david vilabrera , a municipal healthcare worker , said his family has subways in its blood his father was among new york s first black conductors , and his wife s father worked in the system as well as a child , mr vilabrera would often ride along with his father , and today he has brought along his brotherinlaw , daughter , son and two nephews the class of the rails the dtype triplex is one of the most renowned conveyances ever to roll along new york s tracks the triplex consists of three cars permanently joined into a single articulated unit \( one set of wheels does the work of two instead of each section riding on its own , the center section shares wheels with the car in front of and behind it \) the triplex entered service on may 19 , 1927 , and the last one was retired in 1965 elegantly appointed with fans , woven rattan seats and wide doors , its cars are connected by an enclosed , swiveling compartment so that riders can move from one unit to another without being exposed to the elements the triplex was also the first subway train to feature illuminated signs at both ends of every car , as well as at the sides , indicating its route and destination if the sign was white , it meant the train was going through the montague street tunnel green meant it was going over the manhattan bridge and the triplex s great weight at more than 200 , 000 pounds , it is the heaviest car ever used by the new york city subway system gives it a legendarily smooth ride solid engineering notwithstanding , the fact that the triplex is still running 75 years later results from the efforts of mike hanna and a crew of volunteers who work on it tuesday evenings in the coney island yards mr hanna worked for the transit authority for 46 years before retiring in 1995 at one point , he was in charge of the entire coney island maintenance shop , which is , he notes with pride , the largest in the world there are about 14 of us who show up on tuesdays an lirr engineer , a schoolteacher , a motorman , a guy who owns a body shop , a trackman , even a mortician , he said
a woman and her 3yearold son were seriously injured yesterday after a wall of a building that was being demolished in park slope , brooklyn , collapsed on top of them , sending bricks and loose concrete blocks toppling onto their heads niulka almazar , 25 , and her son , juanantonio perez , suffered head injuries when the wall was knocked over the authorities said that a backhoe inside the sealedoff work area had accidentally backed into the wall , which cascaded in a rain of debris onto the sidewalk at the corner of fourth avenue and second street just as ms almazar and her son walked by yesterday afternoon outside the construction site , where a towering yellow backhoe was parked before a dusty pile of rubble , officials of the city department of buildings told reporters that they were issuing four safety violations against the owner of the property , city view gardens , and the demolition company , fmc contracting of new rochelle , ny the citations , which included an order to stop all work at the site , charged that the owner and the contractor had failed to carry out safety procedures properly , said paul wein , a department spokesman it was just before 9 am when ms almazar and her son , who live in sunset park , got off the fourth avenue bus and walked past the thin wooden retaining walls of the construction site , the authorities said they were headed toward a day care center on second street and fifth avenue when the accident occurred according to richard sheirer , director of the city s office of emergency management , local residents watched in horror as ms alamazar and young juanantonio were struck and partly buried by the falling bricks the residents helped dig them out until the police and emergency crews arrived , he said although the two victims were listed in critical condition at lutheran medical center for most of the day , by late afternoon their conditions had improved to stable , mr sheirer said the accident was still under investigation and for the moment there was no criminal inquiry under way , said satish k babbar , the acting commissioner of the buildings department however , when mr babbar was asked by reporters about the demolition company , he said its record was not very great in the past two or three months , fmc had been issued at least 11 safety citations by the buildings department , said mr wein , the spokesman none of the citations were for lifethreatening violations , and they included relatively minor infractions like failing to post a contracting sign the owners of fmc did not return several telephone calls seeking comment yesterday there was no answer at the listed phone number of itzhak katan , the owner of city view gardens carol arena , who lives in the area a rapidly gentrifying section of park slope said she had been concerned enough about the construction that she brought the issue up to her community board she said she complained about the demolition to a man overseeing the project we talk to him , we complain , and he laughs , she said other people in the area were simply shocked out of their daily morning routines by the impact of the falling wall of bricks i got up and the house started shaking , said elsa cuillan , ms arena s neighbor photo investigators said a backhoe knocked over a wall at a construction site in park slope , brooklyn , yesterday \( steve hart for the new york times \)

tora bora , afghanistan , dec 17 the united states' heavy dependence on proxy forces in the afghan war has been a calculated decision that has generally worked well but as the war enters its final phase , the limitations of this policy also seem clear the war aims of the united states and the antitaliban opposition do not always neatly coincide here at tora bora , afghan forces were concerned principally with recovering territory while the united states was intent on the capture or killing of osama bin laden , who has eluded his pursuers elsewhere , as proxy fighters of the northern alliance or pashtun tribes closed in on cities , deals were often made in which taliban officials and fighters were essentially given their freedom there are indications that leading members of the taliban government are being sheltered by fellow afghans neither the taliban leader , mullah muhammad omar , nor his top lieutenants have been captured today , defense secretary donald h rumsfeld cautioned afghanistan s new leaders and wouldbe leaders not to try to protect members of the old taliban government to the extent that we find that people who aspire to high office or high position in afghanistan have been involved in preventing us from getting our hands on people who are responsible for what s gone on in afghanistan will find the united states not terribly friendly to their aspirations , he said the use of proxies has had clear advantages it enabled american forces to wage the war by carrying out airstrikes and dispatching commandos with limited numbers of conventional forces the bulk of the ground fighting was done by the afghan allies themselves in this way , the need to send large numbers of american troops to afghanistan was avoided and the possibility of a popular backlash by a population that has long resisted foreign invaders was reduced avoiding the deployment of a large number of ground troops is a lesson the bush administration says it has drawn from the illfated soviet occupation of afghanistan afghan forces are also the ones who know this multiethnic country and its difficult terrain the best the use of proxies also limits the number of american soldiers who will be killed or injured in this war the united states has helped to make proxy forces more effective by conducting airstrikes , providing arms and deploying military advisers this approach has worked on many levels a number of successes marked the past few weeks mazarisharif fell kabul fell the taliban fell kandahar fell but for most americans over 60 percent according to polls victory will be defined by whether mr bin laden and mullah omar are eliminated , and that objective remains unrealized afghan commanders assert that they share the top american objective but it is clearly not with the same passion they sought mainly to reclaim tora bora and capture or expel arabs and other foreign fighters lured there by al qaeda but washington did not go to war to conquer tora bora its aim , in fact , is to keep al qaeda leaders and their fighters in this region so they can be captured or killed the differing perspectives , which have percolated below the surface , were very much in the open today commander hazarat ali , one of the main afghan military leaders , declared victory on sunday once afghan soldiers had barged into al qaeda s posts in the mountains after american bombing had eroded the enemy resistance today , he expressed surprise that the americans were continuing to bomb , suggesting that the airstrikes were endangering his fighters' new positions they have got their own program , he said of the american forces last night they even bombed us the americans are going to be restless until osama is killed or until someone gives them a document that shows osama has been killed at the pentagon , officials expressed some exasperation with their afghan partners' local preoccupations look , these eastern shura , these socalled eastern alliance , are basically a group of village leaders , a senior american military official said so if the al qaeda in their area have been driven off , and the caves and tunnels around their areas are now safe again to go in , the battle is basically over from their point of view but we want to get a lot of those guys who are now fleeing and trying to get away we want to get bin laden so , yeah , we 've got different objectives right now it is not yet clear whether this difference over priorities will prove to be a major obstacle but it means that managing the unlikely alliance and keeping the afghan partners in the fight has become a new challenge for america s military as it approaches the final chapter of the afghan war the american and british special operations forces that are fighting here with the afghan eastern shura forces try to stay out of sight apart from the usual secrecy that is involved in commando operations , there is a reason for the low profile none of the major afghan commanders here is willing to acknowledge publicly that their muslim troops are working directly with the american military still , reports of differences have emerged last week , commander muhammad zaman was exploring a surrender deal with al qaeda fighters , who wanted to surrender to the united nations washington , which wants to get its hands on the fighters , was quick to silence such talk the split verdict on the fighting in tora bora was not a dispute over facts both the afghan and american commanders agreed that organized resistance by large groups of al qaeda fighters seemed to be at an end , that al qaeda leaders were still at large and that remnants of al qaeda force were trying to flee to pakistan afghan commanders insist that their men are still searching the region for mr bin laden hajji zahir , the son of the governor of the province , said today that his men were pursuing mr bin laden , not because the americans want him , but to strike a blow against world terrorism commander zaman insisted that his men were patrolling up to the pakistanafghanistan border but afghan commanders also talk as if they have fulfilled their main war aims and the search is a secondary mission they also stress that their men are hungry and poorly clothed for winter warfare this is the last day of al qaeda in afghanistan , commander zaman declared on sunday there is no more need for american bombing our men have the situation under control the pentagon delivered its answer later that night american ac130 gunships continued to prowl over the mountain area then a thunderous explosion lit up the sky the americans bombing has resumed and was continuing on the other side of the mountain today
east rutherford , nj after taking some abuse about not filling their arena during the regular season , the devils had a full house last night for game 3 of the stanley cup finals at least until colorado took a twogoal lead playing out here in the swamplands west of new york city , the devils have won two stanley cups but suffered a major setback last night when colorado wore them down , 31 , to take the lead , two games to one , in this series the fans were filing out in the final minutes devils coach larry robinson did not fault them , but blamed his players for carelessness it must be noted that the mood for these finals is not exactly as powerful as it was in grand old railroad hotels where i saw the awesome stanley cup exhibited in montreal , vancouver , calgary and edmonton a decade ago , when canada was part of the national hockey league but do n't take my word for it the devils have been known to take verbal abuse from their own colleagues , including the sainted wayne gretzky , who called this a mickey mouse operation back in 1983 \( when it was just that \) gretzky was in attendance last night , and when the devils scored first , a fan in section 108 called out , hey , wayne , how s that for mickey mouse \? gretzky smiled wanly but did not reply in recent days the devils' modest fan base had been brought up by the avalanche asked wednesday if he expected the devils to enjoy a homeice advantage , patrick roy , the skittish avalanche goalie , said it s hard for me to answer that because i did n't play too many games in that building when it was a sellout ask me after the game joe sakic , the avalanche captain , predicted an energetic crowd , but then he could not resist adding usually , it s not usually , it s halfempty when we 're there later , sakic amended that to being threequarters full , but he also knew the avalanche had sold out 293 consecutive games the devils drew 14 , 865 fans out of a capacity of 19 , 040 when they met the avalanche in early december the avalanche seemed a bit more fuzzy about the score of that game a 61 loss the avalanche had not won in six visits to the meadowlands since 1995 , when that franchise relocated from another canadian landmark , quebec city in that same time , the devils have become one of the very best franchises of their generation it is insulting to the devils to even compare them with a certain franchise that shuts down in midapril , leaving a fantastic skyline to shimmer enticingly to the east and the islanders , a kindred franchise in a distant eastern suburb , have n't done much of anything since their four straight cups from 1980 through 1983 the devils' location out here in the swamplands may allow lou lamoriello to wheel and deal with secrecy and autonomy he does not have to contend with the urban angst that causes mets fans to bellow about steve phillips at the moment of course , lamoriello has n't botched much of anything , ever on the surface , this franchise has almost nothing in common with the old montreal canadiens , who won six stanley cups when robinson was a tall , dignified presence on defense robinson was an assistant coach on the devils' 1995 stanley cup team and took over during last year s run to the cup so much is being made that new jersey is not followed as closely as other teams , robinson said i disagree with that we have fan loyalty here that is second to none we see them everywhere we go a lot of people travel to watch us play , and everybody you meet on the road , they always tell you , 'i am from new jersey and we cheer for you' and i think we have terrific fans here to me , what i enjoy most about being in this organization is that it reminds me a lot of my days in montreal , of how it is run and the type of people that we have in the organization and the type of players that are here ken daneyko , who has been here since 1983 , said you do n't have the history that toronto and montreal and new york have but this is a great area , and we 've enjoyed winning stanley cups here i do n't know anything different like the islanders of two decades ago , the devils have never known the feeling of a city erupting with passion that may change if they move to newark right now , it does n't look good for another of those parkinglot celebrations out here in the swamplands photo a parkinglot gala in the swamplands \( chang w lee the new york times \)
as businesses began to digest the loss of life yesterday , they also had to address the loss of records while many financial firms have automatic backups of their records , law firms are especially dependent on hard copies of documents that might be used in litigation or as legally binding originals after evacuating their employees , federal regulators were also concerned about the status of files and other documents in their offices at the world trade center both the securities and exchange commission and the equal employment opportunity commission had regional offices at 7 world trade center , which was one of the buildings that collapsed after the attack the new york state department of taxation and finance had 222 employees in the world trade center , of which 40 were unaccounted for , according to a statement from gov george pataki s office the eeoc , whose new york district office oversees the operations of seven states and puerto rico , was trying to assess the damage , including the status of its files it s too early to tell how extreme the damage was , said david grinberg , a spokesman for the commission in washington the office s operations have been temporarily suspended , but individuals can still file complaints at local or state agencies , he said the sec will have to reconstruct much of its work regarding investigations and litigation , according to carmen lawrence , who headed the new york operations from 1995 to 2000 the files were largely in paper form , she said , and the sec will now have to reconstruct them all of that is gone , ms lawrence , now a lawyer with fried frank harris shriver jacobson , said nearly all of the roughly 300 people who worked in the offices of thacher proffitt wood , a law firm with its headquarters on floors 38 , 39 and 40 at two world trade center , escaped , the managing partner , omer s j williams , said yesterday the firm is currently trying to operate out of a smaller office in white plains we 've accounted for almost all of our staff , said mr williams , who was waiting on the runway at newark international airport to fly to colorado at the time of the attack and whose flight was eventually canceled we are down to about eight people that we have not been able to reach for now , he said , many of the firm s associates are working from home and a few are working at other offices the firm has created two internal task forces , one to focus on finding either temporary or permanent real estate and another to work on computer access for employees telecommuting is a little difficult because the server was in the building at the world trade center , he said we should have an alternative to that in a few days he acknowledged that the loss of documents and other materials at the firm s offices will be a problem , but said that most documents that are not available electronically signed contracts or letters , for example would probably be on file with the firm s clients our clients so far have been unbelievably understanding and cooperative , mr williams said several law firms not situated downtown have offered space for thacher s lawyers , as have some of its clients , he added several law offices near the two collapsed towers were also affected cleary , gottlieb , steen hamilton , in a black office tower at 1 liberty plaza across the street from the world trade center , was evacuated after the second airplane struck , said william gorin , a partner at the firm as far as we know , everyone got out all right , he said in the wake of the disaster several rival firms called to offer office space , mr gorin said shearman sterling has called skadden has called debevoise plimpton has called , he said that s quite heartwarming and reassuring , and i think we will be taking them up on their offers for now , lawyers for the firm are working from home or at cleary s midtown conference center in the citicorp center on lexington avenue those offices were set up not only to hold meetings but also , in the wake of the world trade center bombing several years ago , as a backup crisis center with computer servers , phone lines , and other equipment we are laptopbased , mr gorin said , which allows lawyers to work anywhere and still connect to the firm s server and work with documents stored there as for paper documents , he said that sooner or later preferably sooner it would be necessary to have access to the offices at 1 liberty plaza again the destruction across the street has already forced the postponement of closings of deals and the shifting of meeting locations to the offices of other firms , he said we do n't have a lot of definitive information from 1 liberty yet , mr gorin said we know the building is intact we 're told that up to 75 percent of the windows on the western side of the building have been damaged other firms with offices near the epicenter of the disaster also reported that they constructed crisis centers in the wake of the bombing several years ago we have everything duplicated on our computers in different places , said mel immergut , chairman of milbank , tweed , hadley mccloy , whose offices at 1 chase plaza downtown also remained closed yesterday it is not at a particular place the firm s lawyers are working from home and from milbank s offices elsewhere , including its conference center in the seagram building on park avenue between 52nd and 53rd streets , he said the computer hookups are a godsend , he said yesterday and tuesday , when phone communications were not reliable , many lawyers could still communicate using blackberry twoway text pagers , he said mr immergut said he expected to be back in the firm s offices early next week but most lawyers who work downtown remained uncertain of when they could return to work the association of the bar of the city of new york said that it would make its offices available to firms affected by the attack the association is at 42 west 44th street , between fifth and sixth avenues there s not a whole lot we can do , said andrew martin , an association spokesman but our building is the biggest asset we have jenifer j arndt , an associate at stroock stroock lavan , said that she was not sure when her firm would reopen its maiden lane offices on tuesday , she and her colleagues watched from their 33rd floor offices and then waited in the lobby for several hours until the dust began to subside there was a part of me that was thinking , 'what do i need to take with me \? ' she said and then there was the part of me that said , 'none of this matters right now'
it s official this year s bonuses for wall street workers will plunge by about 30 percent , to 10 billion , according to state comptroller h carl mccall , whose office annually estimates bonus payments the 43 billion decline the first since 1998 and far steeper than that year s drop means that some investment bankers may not be able to afford the new jaguars of their dreams , and that their spouses may not find baubles from harry winston in their christmas stockings but it has far broader implications for city government \( that 4 billion got taxed at the highest rate \) and for a lot of people whose jobs are far from wall street taxi drivers and florists , baby sitters and busboys , golf pros and travel agents , real estate brokers and antiques dealers everyone who has benefited from the flood of wall street profits washing through the city may now be hurt by the turning tide it has a very big ripple effect for the employment and income of a lot of ordinary people who depend on it for their livelihoods , said marcia van wagner , chief economist for the citizens budget commission , a fiscal watchdog group and , she noted , the drop in bonuses comes on top of the dotcom bust , the national recession and the fallout from sept 11 it may be a quadruple whammy , she said we 're really getting it from all sides mr mccall s estimate of bonus payouts is based upon data that include industry profits and tax collections it is possible that the bonus pool could shrink even more than the comptroller s office has estimated complaints are seeping out from some big brokerage firms about bonuses that are half the amount of last year s and companies that traditionally pay out the bonuses in december and january still have time to cut them further , depending on what their fourthquarter profits look like , said frank fernandez , chief economist for the securities industry association , wall street s trade group at one large firm , the total bonus pool has shrunk by roughly 60 percent , he said though not unexpected , the decline follows a decade of almost uninterrupted increases in wall street bonuses , which in 1991 totaled 41 billion turmoil in the bond market in 1998 trimmed bonuses slightly , to 97 billion from 11 billion , but they quickly rebounded to last year s record 143 billion , according to data from the comptroller s office bonuses last year accounted for about a third of the pay on wall street , according to barbara byrne denham , chief economist of the new york stat , a newsletter focusing on the city s economy and even though wall street jobs make up only 5 percent of the city s employment base , wall street workers pay about 15 percent of the city s main tax revenues , she said city revenues per employee on wall street are almost three times the amount of those from workers in other industries still , ms denham said , the bonus pool is really gravy , as opposed to meat and potatoes job retention is much more significant but the news there is not so good , either since its peak employment of 190 , 100 in august 2000 , wall street had been slowly cutting jobs that is , until october , when it lopped almost 16 , 000 positions , sending the number of jobs at securities firms to 165 , 400 some of those jobs the association estimates as many as 9 , 000 were simply moved to new jersey and perhaps half of them will return but wall street firms are still cutting mr fernandez said that his organization had heard of 8 , 000 or so more layoffs in the industry , and that the pattern had shown that 95 percent of us securities job losses have occurred in new york city none of this is good news for a city that is facing , next fiscal year , a 35 billion gap between revenues and spending nor is it good news for the housing market , especially the market for milliondollarplus coops in manhattan the long and short of it is that this is new york city s key industry , said jason bram , an economist at the federal reserve bank of new york and when there are problems in a key industry , it typically has a disproportionate effect on the economy
gino a circiello , a restaurateur who shunned credit cards , reservations and advertising but built a manhattan institution on the strength of homey italian cooking and 314 exuberantly leaping zebras on tomatored wallpaper , died on friday at his home in manhattan he was 89 gino , his restaurant at 780 lexington avenue , nearly across from bloomingdale s , epitomized the new york of the time when men still wore hats and a plate of spaghetti went for 95 cents it was where ed sullivan ordered the same chicken dish every day and then spread out his papers on a table to work through the afternoon each mother s day , frank sinatra brought a dozen people to the big table in the back manicurists , opera stars and the odd mobster added spice to the sauce mr circiello , with his hair slicked back like george raft s and an elegant suit draped over his slender frame , stood at the front , using his rasping voice to greet everyone like a treasured relative he belonged to a world that does n't exist anymore , his wife , nini , said gay talese , the writer , who has been a regular customer since 1955 , called gino a time capsule the zagat survey for 2002 said the restaurant was frozen in the 40 s , but had the best tomato sauce in town it still has an oldfashioned phone booth with a folding door when it was removed after a fire in 1973 , customers demanded its return in place of credit cards , the management still runs a tab for regulars and mails a bill at the end of the month the flowers , all artificial , are changed as often as three times a year , pretty much with the seasons clearly , less than flattering reviews of the cuisine have been less than lethal the reason , says mario laviano , one of three employees who bought the restaurant from mr circiello in 1985 , is simple it s not a restaurant , it s like a club for example , in 1974 , john canaday began a review of gino in the new york times with a long paragraph arguing that food is secondary to experience in new york restaurants that said , he wrote , if i could pick a single one as the quintessential new york restaurant , it would have to be gino s \( he said everyone called it gino s \) the zebras are a huge part of the attraction mr circiello was a hunter without the means to pay for an african safari , but he reasoned that he could at least afford zebras on his wallpaper so he commissioned a friend to design wallpaper depicting leaping zebras pursued by arrows this makes no sense that i can figure out , mr canaday wrote in truth , it made less sense than he might have realized the designer s initial picture of two zebras omitted a stripe near the tail of one of the two creatures before mr circiello noticed this , half of the 314 zebras were missing a stripe but the paper had been glued to the wall none of the customers in the firstnight crowd noticed , nor did the crowds that followed in the next few weeks or at least they said nothing to him or his staff he decided to keep the paper as it was twice in the last 50 years , the wallpaper had to be replaced each time mr circiello decided to keep the nonuniform zebras people might miss them gino augusto circiello was born in buenos aires on jan 20 , 1912 his italian father worked as a chef in a hotel there while the family was on a trip to their home on the island of capri , world war i started , and they could not return the young gino developed a working knowledge of italian , french , german and english he apprenticed as a waiter in luxury hotels in venice and elsewhere in southern europe at 17 , he sailed for new york , arriving in october 1929 just as the stock market collapsed throughout the depression , he worked as a busboy , a room waiter and an assistant bartender in new york , philadelphia , atlantic city and palm beach while working as a bartender at the waldorfastoria , he began to dream of opening a restaurant on lexington avenue two of his friends , guy avventuriero and emilio torre , liked the idea , and the three used their joint savings to open the restaurant the rent was 400 a month \( it is now 21 , 000 \) , and mr circiello bought a mahogany bar secondhand on the bowery it is still there so are the 27 original woodtopped tables mr circiello s partners retired in 1980 he stayed on till 1985 , when he sold the restaurant to the three current partners in addition to his wife , mr circiello is survived by a brother , augusto , of manhattan and two sisters , yolanda gentile of capri and raffaella musumeci of catania , sicily when he returned to the restaurant after his retirement , diners sometimes erupted in spontaneous applause at home , one of his rugs was a zebra skin from an animal he had shot himself photo gino a circiello , near the front of his east side restaurant in the 1980 s , against a background of leaping zebras on tomatored wallpaper

better frequentflier programs , more convenient schedules , higher fares that , airline industry experts said yesterday , is the most likely outcome for many consumers if american airlines , a unit of amr , succeeds in its plan to purchase trans world airlines and part of us airways american would immediately become a stronger presence along the lucrative and crowded east coast , allowing it to compete more effectively with delta air lines and united airlines , which is seeking government approval for its purchase of the bulk of us airways and with american and united planning to operate jointly one of the shuttles servicing boston , new york and washington , the two giant airlines would have new muscle to compete for corporate travel contracts the deal is bound to heighten the battle for passengers in the region with delta air lines , which provides the other shuttle service and is strong on many northsouth routes along the east coast but american s plan , by eliminating the weak twa from the market , would shelve a carrier that often sells discounted tickets from major cities not served by lowfare carriers like southwest airlines it would also further consolidate an industry that could quickly be moving toward three giant companies any combination among the top six carriers has anticompetitive tendencies , which will probably mean a net loss for consumers , said samuel buttrick , an analyst at ubs warburg american executives , who declined to comment , are continuing to negotiate with potential partners and rivals over the complex fiveairline deal the carrier is trying to buy the portions of us airways that regulators do not want united to have , including gates in six eastern cities and 49 percent of dc air , a new washingtonbased carrier that would be spun off from us airways american , the world s secondlargest carrier after united , would also take control of twa during that airline s third bankruptcy proceeding in a decade united is a unit of ual in the process , american would become by far the largest carrier at kennedy international airport , ending a threeway race among it , twa and delta by swallowing twa , it would also get rid of its peskiest competitor in the caribbean just as that rival was adding flights and keeping fares down perhaps most significant , analysts said , american would be far less likely to sell the number of heavily discounted tickets , through travel agencies known as consolidators , that twa does twa must cut its prices to woo passengers away from larger airlines that offer more extensive routes and better frequentflier benefits out of new york , the real good coasttocoast fares have come on twa , said tom parsons , the chief executive of bestfarescom , which tracks and sells lowfare tickets because none of the carriers have made public statements about the talks , airline experts cautioned that the fallout from the deals remained difficult to gauge still , many consumer advocates and other analysts said american s plan represented a step forward from the proposed unitedus airways merger dc air , by aligning with american , would become a rival of united s rather than a partner as a result , united would have a harder time dominating the two airports in washington s virginia suburbs , dulles and ronald reagan national this is relatively much more competitive than some of the plans that were thrown out earlier , said eric j altschul , a consultant based in toronto for consumers , the first apparent changes will probably be cosmetic ones , analysts said twa , the embodiment of glamorous air travel for many years , would disappear from a nostalgic standpoint , it s hard to accept that twa will not exist , said valerie wilson , the chairwoman of a travel agency in new york that bears her name for the northeast , the deal would mean a big change in the way the bostonnew yorkwashington shuttles operate under the deal , us airways' flights would be transferred to american and united , and those two airlines would then work together , alternating flights each hour but accepting each other s tickets the odd arrangement among two companies that are each other s biggest rivals would make both stronger in the region , analysts said they would then be able to sign more corporate contracts by offering service within the northeast , as well as to the midwest , the west coast and other countries they 'll be able to get you where you want to go with one contract , said michael e levine , a professor at harvard law school and former executive at northwest airlines in the short term , american and united could force down the prices of those contracts , as they try to steal customers from continental which dominates newark international and delta but most analysts said american s proposed takeover of part of us airways would not likely cause fares to fall these big airlines do n't really compete with each other on price , said david s stempler , the president of the air travelers association , a consumer advocacy group routes without southwest airlines or another smaller discount airline tend to have higher fares , regardless of how many major carriers fly it , mr stempler added and over the long term the deals could force other airlines to team up as well , leaving the industry with fewer total competitors and more expensive tickets , analysts said on the other hand , people who now fly twa and us airways would instead travel on american or united , both of which have more extensive schedules and frequentflier programs that would make many connections easier and could increase the range of frequentflier tickets available to them in other ways , travelers may find that the deals hurt the quality of service in an industry that consistently receives terrible scores in consumer surveys the larger each carrier becomes , the greater effect that a work slowdown can have , potentially grounding thousands of passengers when pilots or flight attendants refuse to work overtime or stage other protests from a competitive standpoint , the starkest change could come in the caribbean over the last 14 months , twa has greatly increased its presence in san juan , pr , where american has a hub and flies about half of all passengers because of twa , fares in many caribbean markets have fallen , airline experts said if american buys twa , said mr stempler , the consumer advocate , san juan will revert to more of a monopoly photo donald j carty , the chief executive of american s parent , amr , is likely to face close scrutiny from consumer groups over the takeover proposal \( associated press \) chart map blanketing the nation american airlines , attempting to keep up with united airlines which plans to acquire the struggling

cincinnati , sept 6 talk has been sounding more precious than cheap this summer along the deep racial divide laid bare in civil rights protests and running violence on the streets here last spring for one thing , 700 city residents listened and talked about their racial differences in schools and barbershops tonight , prompted by a television and internet show organized by the local news media but this exercise in repairing civic morale was already being dwarfed by an unusual and far deeper effort to mine candid talk about grievances as the means for settling a pending racial profiling lawsuit against the city and the police wary of the usual courtroom adversary techniques for such a delicate issue , judge susan j dlott of united states district court had called time out in the suit in march , only weeks before the underlying issues exploded in the streets as blacks protested the police and a city curfew was imposed to end bouts of vandalism judge dlott , searching for an alternative to the separate courtroom struggle over race , appointed as the court s special master jay rothman , a mediator experienced in two decades of conflict resolution in the middle east , northern ireland and other global trouble spots the four days of subsequent street violence only confirmed what a trouble spot cincinnati had become the judge has asked dr rothman , 43 , an ohio native , to propose a consensus settlement by studying the impassioned , informed views of cincinnati residents he and his staff at the aria group , a private mediation firm in yellow springs , ohio , are midway through 10 months of extensive interviews and followup negotiations about grievances and goals with about 4 , 000 residents , blacks and whites , representing a cross section of eight major interests in the city one of the eight groups , young people up to the age of 25 , has been quietly consulted all summer , eliciting 750 responses particularly encouraging to dr rothman because none of the respondents demanded anonymity their views and complaints were put through data analysis and returned in summary forms to 30 of the young people in a followup discussion at which they then chose 10 of their peers to produce a final threepage list of proposals the list boils hundreds of views down into five proposals for improving policecommunity relations through respect , cooperation , less confrontation and more investment of resources both sides feel threatened , one youth said you must give respect to get respect , advised another africanamerican youths in our city are not given enough reasons to find hope , said a third in similar fashion , city police officers and their families are being approached for their grievances and advice about 180 have responded , and dr rothman intends to have twice that number before their consensus gathering in november the other groups being interviewed are white and black adults and multicultural residents , officials of the police and the city government , religious and social work professionals , and business leaders this was the judge s idea , to really try and go deeper , said mr rothman , who has a doctorate in international relations and is a specialist in identitybased conflict , in which clashing groups are heard out in detail and taught to seek mutual goals from common grievances his goal , after applying consensus building methods to the groups separately and finally in an 80person gathering of all eight city interests in december , is to refine a single proposal for improving the city s policecommunity relations that all parties to the lawsuit might accept dr rothman , who is scholar in residence at the mcgregor school at antioch university , said he had never heard of conflict resolution being applied this way as an alternative to a federal civil rights suit but whether between jew and arab in jerusalem or black citizens and the police in cincinnati , he said , the common complaint underlying groupidentity conflict is the same there s not enough mutual respect in the lawsuit , the city s africanamerican leaders in the black united front and the state chapter of the american civil liberties union are suing the city and the police , contending that they engaged in years of systematic racial profiling and excessive use of force they point to the fact that all 15 suspects killed by the police in the last six years were black this pattern is also the subject of a justice department investigation the fraternal order of police denies bias , accusing critics of stereotyping officers and undermining law and order but the issue turned into a crisis in april when street protests and vandalism by blacks broke out after the fatal shooting of an unarmed black man who was reported to be fleeing the police the police force is 28 percent minority , while decades of white flight has seen the city s black minority increase to 43 percent the exhaustive effort to forge a common prescription from clashing parties is costing 460 , 000 , with help coming from the andrus family foundation , the city and the greater cincinnati foundation basically , underneath the presented problem of perceived or factual racial profiling is a sense on the plaintiff s side , the africanamerican community , that their dignity , their legitimacy , their needs , their rights are being threatened and frustrated , dr rothman summarized in an interview it s not dissimilar on the police side they say , 'we are not being given the respect of our jobs , not being given the cooperation we need to be the servants that we want to be' underneath these issues we find , in fact , a tremendous amount of resonance as he hears out cincinnati , dr rothman insists that even if one of the parties to the lawsuit opts to back out of mediation and resume the court fight , the work will not be in vain we will have created people with vision who will have built networks and the ideas for action , he said i am seeing the best of cincinnati because i am hearing people say 'this is the future i want' photos jay rothman , left , has spent years as a mediator in various global trouble spots this year , he was asked by a federal judge to try to settle a pending racial profiling lawsuit against cincinnati and its police department \( mike simons for the new york times \) for four

to begin with , computers ca n't be trusted they ca n't be trusted to make sure you have a hotel reservation upon arrival sorry , sir , it s not in the computer , and we 're completely booked and they ca n't be trusted to decide the best college football teams in the country , either they 're used for both , and you generally have no choice about bookings but it is a horse of a different color for college football rankings they defied logic human logic , anyway in their recent decree when it came time to rank the no 2 team for the right to play miami \( 110 \) for the national title , nebraska , which only three weeks ago lost to colorado by a whopping 6236 in its regularseason finale , was picked over properly furious colorado for the jan 3 rose bowl game the computer formula for the bowl championship series ranking is so convoluted that it would make the maze of an afghanistan cave look like the queensmidtown tunnel and then the eight electronically challenged computer services do n't take into account the emotional level of the teams , the way teams improve over the season in most sports , the best teams build as the season progresses and some do n't even compute whether a team won or lost at home or away nebraska did indeed finish the season an impressive 111 the colorado game being the lone blemish on the huskers' record but some blemish it s the kind that might make a teenager hide out in the bathroom on the night of a date true , colorado completed its regular season 102 , losing early games to texas and to fresno state but after whipping nebraska , colorado came back to beat texas , 3937 , to win the big 12 conference championship the same conference , it happens , where nebraska finished third the fourth team in this equation , oregon , which concluded its regular season 101 , also has a right to feel it has gotten the elbow from the computers the computer conglomerate which does n't include the new york times ranking , which placed colorado no 2 said oregon had only the 31sttoughest schedule in the nation compared to nebraska s 14thranked schedule this is computing at its apex and , it says here , most apoplectic the computers at this point could use cold compresses , or an analyst s couch they 're working too hard it would be infinitely more reliable to have knowledgeable individuals people with eyes and ears and brains instead of electrodes and magnetic tapes up until the bcs system came into play four years ago , there was indeed a kind of human system , with the wire service polls atop the heap featuring voting conducted by coaches and journalists the problem is that many of the voters saw few games , some had leanings toward favorite teams and conferences , and some , it must be assumed , did n't know a nose guard from their nose and there were confusions , to be sure none greater than in 1966 , when michigan state and notre dame , undefeated teams , played to an infamous 1010 tie notre dame won the seasonending polls as the no 1 team in the nation , with michigan state second and alabama third alabama was undefeated and sore as a toothache and just three years after that , the polls picked texas as the no 1 team in the nation , inflaming penn state , which had also finished undefeated when president nixon made his pick , going with texas , it got everyone even madder what to do to make the naming of no 1 unequivocal \? nothing there will always be arguments but here is a suggestion to at least make it better there should be a playoff of the top eight teams usually , there is little argument about them oregon and colorado will play in the fiesta bowl on jan 1 , ending their season but the winner should play the rose bowl winner a week or 10 days later for the national championship playoffs exist in every other team sport in college football does n't have a tradition of playoffs in division ia , but they exist in divisions iaa , ii and iii as for tradition , the colleges themselves have made it transient did knute rockne or pudge heffelfinger ever hear of computer rankings \? the contention that a playoff would keep the shoulderpad scholars out of the classroom for longer periods is specious it would add only a few more weeks of football for just a few more teams as for rankings , i propose a supreme court of football experts to choose the top teams every week that is , nine former coaches and players who command the nation s respect beano cook , the estimable espn college football commentator , suggested to me yesterday that there could be a considerable group of these people , from say , retired coaches like bo schembechler , darrell royal , carmen cozza and ara parseghian , to former great college players like roger staubach , tony dorsett , jack ham and , surely , byron white i would narrow this judiciary to nine , having the chief justice , and perhaps some sitting members , rotate from year to year cook would leave out some judges if their old teams or conferences were involved but i would keep them and hope they were n't of the ilk of figureskating judges from the old soviet union if this did n't work , there would be only one other plausible solution computer rankings
judy davis had worked for a surgical instruments maker in cincinnati for three years as a contract worker , not an employee and when she was laid off five months ago , she burst into tears but she was not surprised i loved the work and i was devastated , ms davis said trained in animal science , she had tested the instruments , sometimes on pigs and goats her performance reviews were excellent and she strove to become an employee , but she was always aware that she might not reach that goal the message implicit in contract work , she said , is that the company is not doing well enough to elevate you to a job layoff looms as a possibility in midfebruary , as the economy weakened , ethiconendo surgery , a division of johnson johnson , dropped ms davis , 44 , a divorced mother of two daughters soon thereafter , she joined a job search group at a local church and , at a recent meeting , asked the 50 people present if any had ever been laid off half raised their hands , and i asked them why they were not angry , ms davis said they said the first time was the most devastating this is my first time , but to whom do i address anger \? if i were a business owner and i was not making a profit , i would lay people off , too for the first time since the mid1990 s , american companies are cutting loose many of their employees announcing in the first half of this year alone plans to eliminate some 777 , 362 jobs , compared with 613 , 960 in all of last year but the usual protests and anger are largely missing in the first years of the 21st century , layoffs have a new character while it used to be traumatic to be laid off even once , some employees can now expect to get a pink slip twice or even three times before they reach 50 layoffs are being spread more evenhandedly than in the past , hitting women as often as men , top executives as well as clerks and production workers , good performers as well as bad and often , like ms davis , the laidoff worker reluctantly agrees with the business decision that put him or her on the street the firings , for that matter , are often going hand in hand with hirings as companies lose workers in one department , they are adding people with different skills for another they are , in effect , continually tailoring their work forces to fit the available work , adjusting quickly to swings in demand for products and services to do that , companies are making ever greater use of contract workers and temps like ms davis , who earned 1750 an hour flexibility is the most important ingredient of corporate success today , said eric greenberg , director of surveys at the american management association that involves a certain thickening of the skin on both sides of the equation management is more thickskinned about letting people go , and workers are more thickskinned about accepting layoffs as a condition of employment there is balm to ease the process , though many companies are growing more openhanded with severance and are spending more on outplacement services for their departing workers the outplacement industry is booming right management consultants , the biggest of the nation s outplacement operations , with 140 offices in the united states , signed on 26 , 400 newly laidoff workers from january through june , more than double the 11 , 200 in the first half last year selfinterest plays a role in these sweetened departure packages companies like motorola and cisco systems , for example , are trying to generate good will , even loyalty , among the departing employees the goal being to make them amenable to return when demand picks up cisco , which is shrinking its staff to 30 , 500 from 38 , 000 and paying six months' salary to those who sign severance agreements , is also trying a 21stcentury version of the old industrial furlough in a pilot program , it is paying 70 employees onethird of their salaries while lending them to nonprofit organizations for a year in effect , warehousing them until they might be needed charles schwab , texas instruments , accenture and other companies have similar programs to park employees until the economy recovers when that might be is unpredictable , of course announcements of job cuts jumped to record levels in the first and second quarters , and the percentage of the unemployed who left their jobs involuntarily has risen sharply , to 363 percent in june from 28 percent in december , the labor department says if this pounding continues , a backlash may develop reminiscent of the mid1990 s , when , for example , a newsweek cover article pilloried four prominent chief executives who had downsized companies it used to be a mark of shame to fire workers en masse , the article declared , reflecting the national angst today wall street loves it wall street still loves layoffs that promise to raise profits by reducing labor costs but the circumstances have changed in the mid1990 s , the economy had begun to boom and profits were rising , but the layoffs happened anyway prompting newsweek to speak of greedheads adding to the popular frustration was a continuing belief in the old social contract , in which companies and their workers remained loyal to each other , through thick and thin in the american psyche , that belief had not yet foundered patrick buchanan came to prominence as a presidential candidate in 1996 partly because he drew votes from workers who had lost their jobs or feared losing them
two months before announcing his bid for mayor , michael r bloomberg quietly began resigning from four exclusive clubs in manhattan and westchester county that have predominantly white memberships the disclosure by the bloomberg campaign came yesterday in response to queries from the new york times about mr bloomberg s affiliations with private organizations the campaign released the names of 10 private social and sports clubs in which mr bloomberg maintains a membership , but it also acknowledged that beginning in april , he sent letters of resignation to four others mike feels that the clubs he is currently a member of have inclusive admission policies that are consistent with his personal beliefs , said edward skyler , a campaign spokesman two of the clubs that mr bloomberg quit , the harmonie club in manhattan and the century country club in purchase , were founded by jews in the 19th century because they were routinely denied admission to the established clubs of the time mr bloomberg had been a member of both clubs since at least the late 1980 s , his campaign said the other two clubs , the brook club , which is all male , and the racquet and tennis club , both in manhattan , are also venerable institutions with predominantly white memberships mr bloomberg joined those clubs in the late 1990 s , according to his campaign mr bloomberg s campaign was careful not to criticize the clubs or their members , an indication of the delicate balancing act the billionaire candidate is trying to perform between his social life among the city s elite and his nascent political ambitions a campaign official said the resignations were an acknowledgment of the obligations of running for public office , but mr bloomberg did not want to make a big issue of them mr bloomberg s decision to leave the clubs has been so lowkey that one of his golfing partners at the century country club , arthur levitt , did not know about the resignation when asked last week about mr bloomberg s membership there mr levitt is the former chairman of the securities and exchange commission and a member of the board of mr bloomberg s company , bloomberg lp mr levitt said the club s roster included many influential people , including alan greenspan , the federal reserve chairman , and james d wolfensohn , the world bank president i think there are probably a limited number of nonjewish members , mr levitt said i have seen blacks and i have seen hispanics , but i have no idea whether they are members or not somebody told me there was a black member , but you could hardly say there was lavish representation of the black or hispanic community at century , or any other club , for that matter steven a seiden , president of the century country club , would not discuss the club s admissions policy or membership we do n't comment about any aspect of the club to outsiders , one way or the other , he said we just do n't discuss these things period none of the other clubs responded to telephone calls requesting information about their membership requirements the brook club is closed for renovations until september , according to someone who answered the phone there mr bloomberg has spoken during the campaign about the importance of trying to change organizations from within , particularly in the context of the boy scouts and the ban on homosexual members but in leaving the four clubs , he implicitly acknowledged that they could not be changed fast enough for his political needs and that his affiliation with them could prove an embarrassment asked if mr bloomberg s membership at the century country club might pose a problem for his mayoral aspirations , mr levitt said , i have learned that in politics , any issue is a legitimate issue elinor guggenheimer , the founder of the new york women s agenda and a member of the century country club since 1946 , said the nature of social and sports clubs was to be exclusive not out of prejudice , but because likeminded people enjoy socializing together mrs guggenheimer said she did not know of any black or hispanic members , but she also did not know of black or hispanic applicants who were denied membership because of race or ethnicity a club is a peculiar place , she said it is not a job it a place where friends get together until you break down all of the nice little barriers we put up and we all get to be friends , the chances are you get a group of people who are very much alike the club , she said , has come a long way in other areas , like the treatment of women , although she said it still did not permit women on the golf course in the early mornings on the presumption that they did not work and could play later in the day mr levitt said memberships were limited and very few openings came along it is a practical fact that they have filled up their roster , he said there is n't much turnover very few people leave these soughtafter golf clubs over the years , various members of the sulzberger family , which owns the controlling shares in the new york times company , have also belonged to the century country club arthur sulzberger jr , the chairman of the new york times company and publisher of the times , said his father had once been a member but he was not according to his campaign , the clubs where mr bloomberg maintains a membership include the bond club , the century association , the council on foreign relations , the harvard club , the new york yacht club and the kappa beta phi fraternity , all of which are in new york city the golf club of purchase , the caves valley golf club in maryland and the coral beach and tennis club and the mid ocean club , both in bermuda photo the century country club in purchase , ny , was founded in the 19th century by jews who were denied entry to established clubs of the time \( janet durrans for the new york times \) \( pg b4 \)
tarrytown the 116yearold tarrytown music hall has been slowly awakening from its 20year doldrums these days it welcomes the likes of wynton marsalis and a godspell revival , and its supporters look forward to even greater glories when its anticipated restoration now being attempted on a shoestring is accomplished its art deco marquee is still a twisted , rusted mess , having been nearly demolished by a tractortrailer barreling down main street 18 years ago the theater s redvelvet balcony seats are shabby , but the place retains an aura of dignity and , according to artists who have performed there , its acoustics are exceptional the theater s restoration is being undertaken by its owners , the friends of mozartina musical arts conservatory , known simply as the friends that group has contributed thousands of hours' worth of volunteer work and with the help of main street merchants , mayor paul janos , state senator nicholas a spano and others by way of grants and donations raised some 200 , 000 about 40 , 000 of that is earmarked for the marquee , which , because of its visibility , is considered a cosmetic necessity bids are out now for that job helen ringeisen , a member of the friends advisory board , estimates that it will take 1 million to 2 million to complete the renovation the 1 , 200seat music hall , originally crowned with a steeple , was built in 1885 by william wallace , a local chocolate manufacturer karina ringeisen , another member of the friends advisory board and helen s daughter , said that at first , the place was not a theater at all there were no seats and no stage , she said they had horse shows and flower shows and cotillion balls , rollerskating and town meetings then , in the early 1900 s , they put in permanent seating , the proscenium arch , the stage and the seats , which were redone in the 1950 s to make them wider and allow more legroom because of that renovation , there are now just 840 seats in the auditorium one of the oldest existing legitimate theaters in westchester , the music hall was also one of the first to show motion pictures silent , of course , with an orchestra accompanying the celluloid action from the pit vaudeville arrived in the teens and 20 s , when the owners , the goldblatt family , redecorated inside and out in art deco style and replaced the sideaisle stainedglass windows with silhouettes of bon vivants movies were shown there until the late 1970 s , when the village began foreclosure proceedings with plans to demolish the structure and replace it with a parking lot on valentine s day 1980 , the friends , a nonprofit educational and cultural organization , bought the property for 130 , 000 and established it as a center for the arts artists and groups who have performed or recorded there since then include joan baez , tony bennett , dave brubeck , judy collins , dizzy gillespie , lionel hampton , lyle lovett , wynton marsalis , the preservation hall jazz band , tito puente , leon redbone , chita rivera and sonny rollins , as well as many classical and operatic performers ms ringeisen and her parents , helen and berthold , who is also on the friends advisory board , work as volunteers to restore the music hall there is no salaried staff besides the marquee , another item demanding immediate attention is the velveteen greenandsilver curtain , which will cost 20 , 000 to replace in a quaint reminder of greasepaint history , the curtain and the scenery are controlled by sandbags it s manual labor , ms ringeisen said you do n't push buttons and things move you 've got actually to move your muscles to move things lights and sound , however , are controlled electronically , she added improvements that have already been made include newly equipped dressing rooms with actors equityrequired showers , and new rugs on the orchestra and balcony floors we would have wanted to duplicate the rugs' original design , but it would have cost a fortune , ms ringeisen said so we got something for now , which looks nicer than what was there before , which was just duct tape the new carpet is functional and looks nice even if it s not the original pattern but one day we 'll put back the 1920 s rug , when mystery mr millionaire comes around antique rugs or not , some artists still find much to recommend the music hall three cupolas , in the back of the orchestra just under the balcony , contribute to the excellent acoustics , experts say the plaster domes are hung with crystal chandeliers and decorated with kimonoclad japanese women , oriental lanterns and cranes in flight andre watts , the classical pianist , recorded in the music hall more than two decades ago he declined to comment on his experience there , but his agent , linda marter , said he had found the acoustics clean but recalled that banging radiators interfered with the recording session branford marsalis , the saxophonist , recorded his quartet album requiem in the music hall it s a venerable old hall , with magnificent oldworld acoustics , he said virtually none of the modern studios possess its superb acoustic qualities helen ringeisen tells of the evening when tony bennett was performing there and found the acoustics so favorable that he discarded his microphone and finished the concert without electronic amplification he said he did n't need a mike in this theater , she recalled alan silver , a music producer whose new york label , connoisseur society , has been recording in the music hall for more than 13 years , said , the trick is to try to get on tape , or whatever system you use , the kind of sound you were hearing live photos tarrytown music hall , which is being restored karina ringeisen , left ,

east rutherford , nj , oct 14 every pro football playbook has a fade pass , a soft throw for a receiver who tries to sprint past his defender and gather in the ball the fade is usually to a corner of the end zone in practice last week , the miami dolphins introduced a twist , a fade down the middle when miami unveiled the play today , it did not work it resulted in the first of two interceptions near the end of the game that saved the jets' 2117 upset of the dolphins at giants stadium it also resulted in frustration for miami , which led the jets , 170 , late in the third quarter , then saw everything go wrong afterward , some dolphins sat in their locker room and stared at nothing zach thomas , miami s emotional middle linebacker , muttered , they made the playoffs once in 12 years the jets were leading , 2117 , when the dolphins' hopes faded with their fade pass with 1 minute 17 seconds left to play , chan gailey , the offensive coordinator , called for the inside fade quarterback jay fiedler was the pitcher and wide receiver oronde gadsden the intended catcher on the previous play , fiedler had scrambled 26 yards to the jets' 6yard line , and he was sure a touchdown was coming the next play was the fade , he said , sort of a slantandgo to oronde we worked on it all week he got behind the cornerback , and you hope that the safety bites a bit , but he got over and got a hand on it fortunately for them , the ball bounced straight up , the worst bounce we could possibly get i could have thrown it away , but it was a jump ball over oronde s head and they made a play the dolphins had not anticipated that damien robinson , the jets' free safety , would get back in time to help cornerback marcus coleman by the time coleman batted the ball upward , he , robinson and gadsden were not in position to grab it but middle linebacker marvin jones was , intercepting the ball for a touchback by the time the pass was descending in the end zone , gadsden said , he was not trying to catch it he saw the double team and recognized the danger it was n't working out the way it should be , he said , so i was just trying to slap it down or break it up but i had a guy over my back and i lost track of the ball in retrospect , dave wannstedt , the dolphins' coach , said , maybe it would have been better if jay had thrown the ball away but wannstedt also said his team had its chances , at least until victor green s interception with 33 seconds left we had the ball twice inside the 10 and did n't score , wannstedt said we did n't do a good job of stopping the run on the perimeter , not at all they ran the ball when they had to and we did n't when we had to four turnovers to none forget about all the stats but that one wannstedt and his players said it was not a case of the dolphins' falling apart in the second half , but rather of the jets' adjusting as cornerback patrick surtain said , when we were leading , 170 , we had the mentality that we were behind i do n't think we let down , tim ruddy , the dolphins' center , said we made mistakes that gave them momentum and in the second half , they did more blitzing and they brought a safety up for run support they made some good adjustments we made turnovers the jets had to do something in the first half , the dolphins rushed for 80 yards , and with lamar smith carrying 17 times , they had the ball for more than 22 of the 30 minutes in the second half , the dolphins rushed for only 35 yards give them credit , fiedler said they went to a little more man coverage in the second half to stop our running game they made us pass the ball , and we could n't capitalize on it even after they scored their first two touchdowns , i felt comfortable but any time momentum swings like that , it s hard to stop it the jets have now beaten the dolphins seven times in a row it starts feeling like we have a hex or something , fiedler said when we break it , maybe we will beat them seven in a row
seton hall and , to a lesser extent , st john s , have fallen far from preseason expectations mercifully , their disappointing seasons will collide in the big east tournament at madison square garden today in a bit of fortunate seeding one team is guaranteed of easing its struggles i never thought we 'd be in the nit , st john s guard sharif fordham said i thought we 'd go to the final four and win the national championship we have awesome talent that could possibly carry us to national championship after peaking with a no 7 ranking , seton hall \( 1413 \) has lost 10 of 13 games , but has assured itself of a 500 record and consideration for the national invitation tournament a loss for st john s \( 1414 \) in today s game , which will start at about 2 30 pm , would put the red storm in a once unthinkable situation the defending big east champions would not qualify for the nit which requires at least a 500 record and would give coach mike jarvis his first losing record in 16 seasons we 'd take full responsibility , fordham said the biggest obstacle , st john s players said , has been the lack of consistent play from its core players fordham has spoken to his teammates about not relying too much on one player and picking up the rest of their game when they struggle on offense he has even spoken to the talented freshman omar cook about not waiting until a possession s last five seconds to take a shot fordham may have already lit a small fire by saying that st john s is expected to win today because seton hall squeaked into the tournament in its last game pirates guard andre barrett agreed that the pirates were considered underdogs , but added that that does n't mean the win is guaranteed to them fordham said , if we go out in the first game , we would hang our heads and think the season s a waste cook said st john s would make up for its season by winning the tournament as point guards who control their teams , cook and barrett each took blame for not doing more this season i think i could 've been more of a leader , instead of being a follower , said barrett , who is averaging 107 points and 59 assists a game cook , averaging 154 points and 84 assists , said he had n't had a good game yet , despite winning some games by himself none were a breakout game , cook said once i do that , people will follow me cook and barrett grew up as friendly rivals in brooklyn , and were delighted that they would continue their competition in the big east , along with connecticut guard taliek brown but as the losing continued , cook and barrett fell out of touch they have n't spoken since midseason like the youngest child in a family , cook has been irritated that his and barrett s struggles have been blamed on youth sometimes you get tired hearing , 'oh , they 're young , ' said cook , who also cited the players' unfamiliarity with each other , although most have played together during summer tournaments barrett took a friendly jab at cook asked about cook s average of five turnovers a game , barrett explained for a person that throws so many risky passes , he s going to get them but at the same time , he s not going to stop making those passes point guard is just one of today s subplots st john s has no one to match up with seton hall s 6foot9 forward , eddie griffin anthony glover , three inches shorter , is a banger , and st john s will probably try to force griffin away from the basket with physical play and although cook said he intended to win the championship , no tournament team has won four games in four nights connecticut tried last season , and was exhausted in the championship game loss to st john s , huskies coach jim calhoun said recently st john s has also not won consecutive games since its fourgame winning streak ended jan 22 and did the red storm forget last year s championship was its first since 1986 \? st john s biggest advantage , of course , is that the tournament takes place on what is essentially its home court , where the red storm has a 64 record this season its doubleovertime loss to syracuse on sunday ended a 14game winning streak against big east opponents on the garden floor jarvis blamed that defeat on st john s 22 missed free throws and even though st john s is shooting a poor 63 percent from the line , that s another way of saying the red storm was able to compete with syracuse on the floor but st john s did n't win that game , and has lost three straight and seven of nine
as the dow jones industrial average suffered its worst week since the great depression , attention inevitably gravitated toward those who were selling stocks , and why they were doing so but the far more important issue in the long run will be whether this crisis damages confidence in the american economy and in america itself the biggest sale of the week was a 2 billion block of stock in walt disney that sale was made for the same reason that uncounted other sales were made even though many americans felt that it was their patriotic duty to support the stock market in the face of terrorism the seller needed the money , and had no choice the sale was made by members of the bass family of texas , a family that has been viewed as one of the richest in the world they had borrowed too much money to make investments that had lost value , and they faced margin calls like any other overextended investor other sales no doubt have been made , and will be made in the future , by investors who have lost their jobs and simply need to sell securities to generate cash to live none of that selling , painful as it may be for the sellers and perhaps for the stock market , reflects a real change in investor sentiment the shock of the attacks has almost certainly slowed the economy , and will create a recession if one is not already under way but easing by the federal reserve and spending on reconstruction and defense by the government will stimulate the economy , and the recession will end at some point stocks typically begin to rise several months before the end of a recession , and that gives reason to hope that the worst of the stock market fall is behind us but after those factors have faded , the more important longterm question for the stock market will remain will fundamental attitudes about investments and about the american economy be changed by this disaster and what follows \? a lot of people have learned over the last 10 or 15 years that the stock market always bounces back , said stanley shopkorn , formerly head of equity trading for salomon brothers and later a hedge fund manager he recalled that there was no such confidence back in the mid1970 s , when wall street suffered its worst bear market since the depression that was also the last time that all the major economies of the world the united states , europe and japan were in recession at the same time japan is in recession now , the united states probably is , and european economies have been slowing and could enter a recession soon then , mr shopkorn recalled , stocks traded for 5 to 10 times estimated annual earnings , valuations that are far below even the depressed valuations of the current bear market investors who had flocked to stocks in the late 1960 s had become completely disillusioned the mid1970 s were also the last time that the future of the united states seemed bleak to many people then the entire western world had been thrown into recession by a surge in oil prices , inflation was rising and many believed that the economic future belonged to the oil producers few if any people believed that the american stock market was sure to be an excellent longterm investment in recent years , investors around the world have come to believe that the american economy is the most dynamic in the world and therefore a place they have to invest it is widely accepted that stocks are virtually sure to go up , at least in the long run the really important issue is whether what happens in coming months and years will make people think that america is losing its preeminence and is becoming a relatively risky place to invest a prolonged , bloody and inconclusive war against terrorism probably would bring lower stock market values even if the economy is growing again investors could come to have less confidence in the future of the american economy , and that confidence plays an important role in determining how much money is invested in stocks the dow jones industrial average ended this week down 143 percent some of that decline was inevitable , given that world markets had fallen about 5 to 15 percent after the attacks while the american market was closed but it also reflected both forced sales and sales from people worried that the war being proclaimed in washington would not be a success a country that felt invulnerable now wonders if , where , and when the next attack will come there have been few comparably bad weeks in the past even in the 1987 crash , when the dow fell 227 percent on one day , by the end of the week it had recovered to be off just 132 percent for the week this is just the third fall of more than 14 percent since the dow took its present form during world war i the worst , a decline of 155 percent , came in the week ended july 21 , 1933 then the economy was mired in the great depression , and a speculative recovery in the market was collapsing almost as bad was the week ended may 17 , 1940 , when the index dropped 142 percent the news then was that the french army was collapsing one thing common to both times was a sense that the future of america and the world seemed dim world economies had collapsed by 1933 , and attempts at recovery had failed in 1940 adolf hitler s germany was triumphant , and it was far from clear that he would ever be stopped those worries proved to be wrong , although in each case it took years to become clear if the american stock market is to return to the optimism it was demonstrating less than two years ago , it will be necessary for investors to conclude that fears about the longterm success of america are as unfounded now as they were in 1933 and 1940
the letter from new york city to welfare veterans is blunt your time limits for cash assistance will be expiring this year , one version says , referring to the fiveyear lifetime limit on federal cash aid we have scheduled an appointment for you to be seen so you can discuss how you plan to manage your household expenses the notice went to angel martinez , one of two working parents in a family of five who were getting by on low wages and their small cash aid supplement it went to florence dawson , the sole parent in a family of six , who is still not working for pay , but stretches reduced benefits with dried beans and the bread she bakes and it went to nancy nay , whose battles with cancer , asthma and sickle cell anemia are still interfering with her ability to participate in workfare and support her teenage daughter these are just three of the 38 , 800 new york city families who face a federal welfare cutoff in december but their stories suggest that the universe of such cases is far more diverse and complex than champions and critics of time limits expected on the whole , they are neither the most recalcitrant nor the least resourceful of the poor in about 32 percent of the cases , at least one parent has a job , like mr martinez about 22 percent are now classified by the city as noncooperative , like ms dawson the rest are divided among those doing workfare in exchange for their benefits , those in job training , those deemed by the city to be temporarily ill , disabled or elderly , and those still being assessed moreover , many , like ms nay , have shuttled among many of these categories , for reasons sometimes lost in the bureaucracy the fate of families who hit their lifetime limits on aid , from whatever mix of bad luck or bad choices , has long loomed over the welfare overhaul would the government enforce such cutoffs , regardless of suffering \? would it take the specter of such suffering to motivate the most dependent to help themselves \? in new york city , often the epicenter of the welfare debate , such questions now look simplistic first , the state , required by its constitution to aid the needy , has already spread a safety net of sorts though how , when and for whom it will operate is still uncertain then , when the time limits really take hold , mayor rudolph w giuliani , who took a hard line on ending welfare during an economic boom , will have been succeeded by a new mayor facing an uncertain economic climate for now , though , the giuliani administration is pushing hard to shrink the group of families reaching their federal time limits , and the letters are part of that campaign individuals should use the fiveyear milestone as an important opportunity to reassess their lives and their progress toward achieving selfsufficiency , jason a turner , the city s welfare commissioner , recently told a city council committee as he announced more welfaretowork programs but what welfare officials call a milestone looks a lot like a cliff to many of the families every organization that represents poor clients is getting a stream of calls saying , 'how am i going to live when my aid ends \? ' said don friedman , a senior policy analyst at the nonprofit community food resource center , in a comment echoed by others in employment programs , settlement houses and legal aid offices the state and the city have said that those reaching the time limit would have to reapply for aid under the statefinanced system known as safety net assistance but the system , a mix of vouchers and debit cards , would significantly reduce cash benefits and is not expected to be in place until at least the spring of 2002 moreover , some cases may be found ineligible or closed during the application process , officials and advocates said a closer look at three brooklyn families as they weigh limited options in complicated lives shows fear , confusion and even panic over the possible consequences of the time limits for their children working , but fearing a fall angel martinez rejects the notion that he and regla belette , parents of three in the bushwick neighborhood of brooklyn , are a welfare reform success story we 're giving it our best shot , said mr martinez , 40 , and it seems to be backfiring in our face mr martinez worked for years in a factory and for a music company , making 9 an hour , before he went to prison for a 1990 drug conviction when he got out , he used public assistance to complete drug rehabilitation , excelled in his welfaretowork training program , and was recently promoted from a cleanup crew to a warehouseman in the old brooklyn navy yard ms belette , 26 , who turned to public assistance during the three years mr martinez was in prison , spent a year in a workfare assignment at a veterans affairs hospital , escorting mentally ill patients upstate now she is paid by the city to take care of her sister s three children while her sister is in a workfare assignment but because of computer malfunctions , ms belette s babysitting pay from the city was delayed for months when the cutoff notices began coming , their cash aid had been cut to 89 every two weeks , and mr martinez was earning only 6 an hour , with no benefits , he said

atlanta , march 23 john chaney did not need to sweat much tonight , but his clothes were as disheveled as ever after temple s easy 8472 victory over penn state in a south regional semifinal , chaney , the owls' coach , is one victory from going to his first final four but the victory must come against the defending national champion , michigan state it s something we want to do as a team , to take him somewhere he s never been at the division i level , temple guard quincy wadley said he s definitely deserving of it , and we have the opportunity to do it right now it is chaney s fifth trip to the final eight his teams have never lost a round of 16 game temple lost to duke in the regional final two years ago on sunday , the owls \( 2412 \) face michigan state , which defeated gonzaga , 7762 , in tonight s other semifinal temple won by double figures for the third straight ncaa tournament game using the same strategy a numbing zone defense , a short bench and the terrific offense of guards lynn greer and wadley temple lost seven games in a row in midseason and needed a strong performance , if not a title , in the atlantic 10 tournament to assure itself an ncaa bid the owls won the conference tournament when you do n't think it 'll happen or think it should happen , it happens , said the 69yearold chaney , in his 19th season at temple we just wanted to get in the tournament and see if these guys could be lightning in the bottle that s how i feel every year but it s very surprising we got here with seven usable players that is the most unusual thing that has ever happened to me in my life greer scored 13 of his 21 points in the first half and made all 10 of his free throws wadley finished with 13 points temple center kevin lyde had 13 points and 13 rebounds as temple outrebounded penn state , 4427 the temple reserve greg jefferson scored a careerhigh 15 points guard titus ivory scored 20 points and center gyasi clineheard added 18 points for penn state penn state s football coach , joe paterno , made the trip to see the game , but even his presence in the georgia dome stands could not help paterno could not have been happy to hear the temple fans chant stick to football ! in the second half the nittany lions struggled especially against the owls' 131 matchup zone penn state \( 2112 \) had faced temple in december five of the seven teams to face temple twice this season had shot better in the second meeting , but familiarity did not penn state help tonight making its first appearance in the round of 16 since 1955 , penn state shot only 269 percent in the first half temple used a 225 run to lead at halftime , 3921 penn state s crispin brothers , joe and jon , were a combined 1 for 11 in the half , including 1 for 9 on 3point attempts take away clineheard s 5for8 performance in the half and penn state made just 2 of 18 shots this is definitely the best i 've seen our defense , greer said penn state shot 516 percent in the second half , including 55 percent \( 11 for 20 \) on 3pointers , to draw as close as 7262 in the closing minutes it was not nearly enough to deny chaney another chance at the final four it s not only him , but the players want it , too , greer said none of us have ever been to the final four
young women are particularly avid travelers and they seem to be edging out their male counterparts the 16yearold daughter of a friend just went to france for a month with a school group composed of 28 girls and 4 boys one can hazard a few guesses why this might be so traveling is a subspecies of selfimprovement , and a voyage out is not infrequently also a voyage of selfdiscovery , one that requires a lot of navelgazing and journalwriting , activities that most young men , unless they 're aspiring rock stars , are disinclined to pursue of course , older women also hit the road , and at any age women experience the adventure of foreign places differently from men there are universal constants every woman traveling solo is harassed in the same manner the world over so common are the questions , the answers should be included in their own section in every berlitz phrase book do you have a boyfriend \?

you do not have to feel left out of the concerned citizens loop if the words nuclear energy or the name chernobyl drives you into the depths of intimidation most people have strong feelings about the complex issues at stake , but many feel they just do not know enough and joe sutton would not want to scare you by mentioning termelin , a nuclear power plant that has been referred to as chernobylstyle , in the czech republic , 30 miles from the austrian border one of its two reactors went on line in october but mr sutton , who wrote the third army , a new play that opened wednesday and will run through feb 11 at the long wharf theater in new haven , would not mind scaring people in the manner of the third man , the classic 1949 cold war thriller from its title to its mastery of the suspense genre , the carol reed film , in which orson welles starred with more than just a touch of evil , is as much an inspiration for mr sutton s play as contemporary moral conflicts , political chicanery and capitalist manipulation his play is about physics as much as proof , the extraordinary dramatic hit on broadway , is about mathematics the third army may be morally heavy , but the playwright means it to be technologylite mr sutton , who wrote voir dire , a play about the objectivity crisis of jurors , which was produced at long wharf in 1997 , lived in the southern part of bohemia , one of the two distinct regions of the czech republic , in 1993 although he had a research mission and worked on an oral history of the townspeople , mr sutton was steeped in the most idyllic part of the landscape , the rolling hills , the glittering countryside , the pastel colors but the source material for this play had yet to be brought to fruition , he added the third army , a title mr sutton said has many levels though it is not easy to explain militarily , is being called as a global political thriller but mr sutton said the political context is a pretext it is closer to a mystery , and on some level , i hope it is fun not that the play avoids ideology in favor of entertainment one of the play s five characters , lubo brodsky , is a naturalized american citizen , a czech emigre returning to his country with an industrial agenda , an agent of opportunism but the third army is not a good guysbad guys play , mr sutton said this man has his positive energy , misguided or not , he added after a preview performance last week , mr sutton felt encouraged when an audience member said of brodsky , i thought he was a bad guy , but he s not and brodsky s wife , another character , sometimes shares his agenda , sometimes not , mr sutton said some characters are less appealing than others , but none are saintly , none unsaintly you decide another character is a professional expatriate who , in mr sutton s words , represents the cachet and the celebrity of the american abroad then there is the american journalist , described by the mr sutton as an embodiment of the new wave impulse of the romantic free press and one character , who is czech , reflects the struggle of national identity of a tiny state , he said it is clear that the playwright means to question what good americans do for the world indeed , are americans good for the world \? and hopes the answer is very complicated and that the audience will chart its implications and engage in critical , deductive thinking besides that , the play has great laughs , mr sutton added , knocking wood the third army , long wharf theater , 222 sargent drive , new haven performances through feb 11 tickets \( 203 \) 7874282 photo neil maffin , left , and jan triska performing in the third army at the long wharf theater in new haven the play runs through feb 11 \( t charles erickson \)
the sketchy and the trashy do fine so does a neat little entertainment but when it comes to turning a major work of literature into theater , audiences can be in for a long , bumpy ride what is a major work of literature \? one whose shape and language feel inevitable on stage our bond with the language gets fragmented the narrative voice disperses we 're dependent on dialogue , monologue and soliloquy it s true that in more and more theater pieces actors take on the narrator s role and speak directly to us they embody the storyteller , but they complicate the function of storytelling there is a performer in front of us , and we are busy reacting to the performance along with the story which may or may not be the best thing for either one how do the director and the set and lighting designers find the best visual language for a writer s descriptions and webs of metaphor \? when and how , if at all , should music be used to partner , inflect or replace words \? it is endlessly fascinating , this question of how musical sounds and rhythms enhance or entomb a text and finally , how do sights , sounds and people in a public space actors and audience equal or better the privacy of reading \? when you are alone and wholly enthralled , reading takes you to that charged space george eliot called the roar on the other side of silence none of this means that i wish to protect certain kinds of literature from theater it is thrilling to see fiction or \( much less often \) a scholarly text or essay leave the page to seek an independent , equally good and possibly better life on the stage that is what i wanted for kafka s exquisitely murderous story in the penal colony , made into a musictheater work by philip glass and directed by joanne akalaitis \( it is playing at the classic stage company \) we are in an unnamed country , in the shadow of a dead commander an important visitor from europe arrives with tepidly civilized values these are tested when an impassioned colonel from the old regime shows off his prize instrument of torture , lobbying for its continued use despite a new and more lenient commander a victim and executioner are at hand the machine is ready to perform its task , which is to inscribe the victim s crime on his flesh with needles and since the victim has not been told what crime he committed , only at the point of death , when he is literally pierced through , does he understand or read it the word and the deed are one the torture is exact , its meanings are multiple no one is better than kafka at joining the mysteries of setting and motive to scientific precision about characters and actions , however fantastic the consequences and for all of those reasons , kafka cannot be translated literally to the stage some theatrical equivalent that invokes without imitating him must be found literalism is what we are given here rudolph wurlitzer s libretto does some predictable condensing and highlighting the new element is the figure of kafka \( played by jesse j perez \) he recites passages from his diaries , letters and stories , he copies bits of the action , he scribbles text on the floor , which , in john conklin s wellconceived set design , is covered with writing and with kafka s picture the music , played by a string quintet , is continuous recitative and declamation over mr glass s familiar ostinato bass the visitor and the officer sang well \( i saw john duykers and herbert perry the night i went on alternate nights , tony boutt and mr perry s brother , eugene , perform the roles \) but how ponderous the score sounded a marriage between the rhetoric of minimalism and the rhetoric of intellectual melodrama and ms akalaitis s direction took the same path at times she used repetitive gestures and dance patterns to echo or abstract the action but neither the movements nor the stillness had real physical tension or concentration everything was solemn , solemn , solemn anguished , anguished , anguished you could argue that incessant solemnity and anguish are true to kafka , but they are n't when deprived of subtlety kafka slips wit into his horrors details like the colonel s little vanities over his uniform , or the visitor s selfconsciously inept courtesies toward the condemned man the terrors in his work are all the stronger because they are laid out with cruel delicacy his shifts between the normal , the abnormal and the grotesque are microtonal instead of a musictheater work , we get an intoned and enacted demonstration on the importance of kafka s story i felt i was in an induced state of theatrical somnambulism 'o pioneers ! ' is n't it interesting when a work that is n't out to display weighty intellectual or experimental credentials takes up the same challenge and succeeds \? i am thinking of the acting company s adaptation of willa cather s novel o pioneers ! which toured the country last year and joined forces with the women s project to play at their theater last month \( the production was originally commissioned and developed by the women s project more than 10 years ago \) i hope it is revived a television version of the novel with jessica lange had me convinced that cather should never be dramatized not because her work does n't have drama there is plenty of ambition and conquest , many kinds of unrequited love and enough lethal marriages for several lifetimes
over the objections of prosecutors , a federal judge in manhattan said yesterday that he would instruct the jury in the embassy bombings trial to disregard the testimony of a former army pilot who described the killings of 18 american soldiers in somalia in 1993 prosecutors have contended that the attack in mogadishu , the somali capital , was part of a global terrorism conspiracy to kill americans that was led by osama bin laden and that also included the bombings of two american embassies in africa in 1998 , which killed 224 people although the government had not said that mr bin laden s followers directly killed the americans , it maintained that his group , known as al qaeda , was indirectly involved training the fighters who eventually carried out the attacks and later taking credit for the killings but defense lawyers contended that there was no evidence directly tying the four men on trial or others in al qaeda to the specific killings of the 18 soldiers the judge , leonard b sand of federal district court , excluded the pilot s dramatic account of a squadron of american black hawk helicopters coming under unexpectedly harsh fire , leading to the 18 deaths , after a federal prosecutor said , we 're not saying al qaeda s people pulled the trigger our theory is training responsibility , not physical killing , the prosecutor , patrick j fitzgerald , said judge sand s ruling was made on a day when the defense at first seemed poised to rest its case , with only a few remaining items to be offered to the jury , before closing arguments were to begin as early as tuesday but at the last minute , lawyers for one defendant , wadih elhage , who has been accused by the government of serving as mr bin laden s personal secretary , indicated that their client might want to testify the lawyers agreed to give judge sand their client s final decision on monday mr elhage has been charged with being a member of the terrorist conspiracy and with lying to a federal grand jury when questioned about his activities judge sand s decision to exclude the testimony of the pilot , james f yacone , now an fbi agent , was made after prosecutors said they were dropping an act , or assertion , in the indictment that charged that mr bin laden had trained people who were eventually involved in the somali attacks i do n't think in the present state of the record , judge sand observed , there is evidence which shows that the 18 deaths named in that overt act were attributable to forces allied with al qaeda , as opposed to forces allied with any other faction in somalia even before the trial , the extent of mr bin laden s role in the somali attacks had been questioned , even by some former american officials who had served in somalia and were quoted in news accounts as expressing doubts that mr bin laden had helped to train or arm the men who had killed the soldiers in court , one of mr elhage s lawyers , sam a schmidt , told the judge , they have to abandon any claim that any member of al qaeda actually participated in the physical act of attempting to kill or killing americans in somalia but mr fitzgerald made clear that the government was not backing down from its contention that mr bin laden s group had sought to kill americans in somalia the government s theory has never been a forensic case of proving a murder in somalia , saying this bullet came from al qaeda members , he said what we have sought to prove , he said , is that al qaeda was involved in somalia mr fitzgerald cited trial testimony from a former al qaeda member that mr bin laden s military commander had gone to somalia to assess how the somalis might fight the americans a call by mr bin laden for attacks on the americans in somalia and a computer file seized from an al qaeda member in kenya that said mr bin laden s followers were responsible for the somali attacks we 're not going to say that when agent yacone was shot down that an al qaeda member pulled the trigger , mr fitzgerald said our point is to show the state of mind of the al qaeda conspiracy mr fitzgerald said the government may also introduce as rebuttal evidence that mr bin laden was involved in a dec 29 , 1992 , bombing on american troops who were in a yemen hotel on their way to somalia although some marines were injured in the bombing , none were killed , he said

the geiger counter that the mint theater company waves over theater history in search of longunperformed treasures has identified a stillticking nugget in rutherford and son a 1911 family melodrama written by a young englishwoman , githa sowerby , the play has the emotional depth , narrative pull and linguistic potency to retain an impact today in fact , it is a hefty , ambitious and sneakily complicated piece of work , keenly attuned to the societal divisions in the britain of its time between generations , between regions , between economic classes , between victorian and 20thcentury morality and between the sexes it s a lot to take on for a small company with a small stage , and unfortunately , for all the good will the mint players bring to the production , the play more or less defeats them rutherford and son , sowerby s first play , was received to acclaim , and the author was subsequently described by the early feminist emma goldman as history s first significant female playwright she wrote other plays , but none achieved anything close to renown , and she has more or less fallen off the radar screen in spite of an evidently successful revival of rutherford and son at the royal national theater in london in 1994 in any case , she s new to me as a playwright , and even the most cursory information about her is tough to come by she was born in 1876 , grew up in northern england , the locale of rutherford , and was living in london when she wrote the play , apparently taking time out from her day job , making fairytale books with her sister millicent , an illustrator there are parallels to the playwright s family in some of the play s characters , but it is not , evidently , a genuinely autobiographical work her father was a landscape painter and not the tyrannical and closedminded businessman that the title character is in the play , john rutherford views his tyranny over his home and business a glassworks as a necessity for overcoming wretched lowerclass status , a status that he believes his family has escaped through hard work but as the play opens , the business is struggling and is dependent on the development of a new process that was accidentally discovered by his elder son , john jr , a somewhat feckless fellow with halfbaked aspirations to high society whose edwardian perspective on good fortune differs from his father s victorian severity he s a yuppie , of sorts and he refuses to yield the formula for his process until his father pays him for it that , however , is the most skeletal of plot outlines the eight characters include the elder rutherford s other feckless son , richard , who has become a priest his daughter , janet , a selfloathing spinster who is carrying on a passionate affair in secret with her father s hired manager and john jr s wife , mary , an office worker who met her husband in london before being dragged to misery in the north , where she is treated by the family with a damp chill for being an outsider , for on the one hand being citysoft and on the other not being the society girl who would raise her husband to the more gentle class he affects both janet and mary feels colossally oppressed in the stifling patriarchal autocracy that the family isolated by its affluence in a small town that is itself isolated on the moors has become and the playwright , obviously sensitive to characters closest to her in age and temperament , has given them the stiffest spines in the play they must suffer for their liberation , and they do the other characters include a couple of mouthpieces one is rutherford sr s sister , ann , a dour and unquestioning woman of 60 or so who clearly represents the unpleasantness of the narrowminded life her brother has built around them the other is a townswoman who has come to plead with rutherford to hire back her son , who has stolen some money from the factory their scene together , polemical but nonetheless well written , is about the cruelties of class warfare over all , in the network of relationships quite knotted and interesting sowerby obviously constructed a backdrop for social conflicts that seem not only periodtrue but resonant one does n't wish to be too crusty with a production that does the welcome task of reintroducing such a worthy work , but alas , the play itself transcends its treatment here the set , done in neat brick and furnished with apparently storebought faux antiques , looks more like the interior of a brand new summer cottage in , say , the maine woods than a turnofthecentury family home on the moors with the exception of jurian hughes , whose janet seems genuinely to emanate from within , the cast is game but overmatched \( and in a couple of cases hapless \) most of the players spend more effort straining with the regional patois than making their characters engage with one another and under richard corley s relentlessly humorless direction , not one of them shows the flicker of a smile until more than two of the play s nearly three hours have passed finally , the production seems more overwhelmed than overjoyed by the effort of mounting the play rutherford and son by githa

fortyfive years ago , elvis presley made his first movie , a musical civil war drama in which he marries his dead brother s girlfriend and later finds out his dead brother is alive that civil war caused people so much trouble ! the movie was called love me tender it features the song of the same name for which elvis , in a mindboggling collaboration , wrote the lyrics to a stephen foster melody elvis knew so little about moviemaking that when he arrived for the first day of shooting , he had memorized not only his dialogue but also the entire script by 1969 , when he walked through charro , a western so execrable that the horses look embarrassed , he does not appear to have learned even his own lines in 16 years elvis presley made 33 movies , and it is one of the innumerable tragedies of the film business that none of the films fully accommodate his amazing talent most of them , in fact , are n't good at all and i do n't mean good like the bicycle thief i mean good like the road to morocco this is not to denigrate his talent , only his development and exploitation of it he is unquestionably a giant of american popular music , the landmark male singers , it seems to me , being louis armstrong , bing crosby , frank sinatra , elvis , bob dylan and bruce springsteen his early television appearances are electrifying , still the most astonishing mix of ignorance , rhythm , sex and showmanship ever put before the public his talent to arouse and delight is all the more gratifying in light of what followed a degradation of audience and artist alike that eventually ravaged him as well yet his movie career is a catalog of squandered promise it begins tantalizingly and ends in squalor in love me tender , while he is not consistently good , he is undeniably winning there is a sincerity and eagerness in his performance that does not so much deny criticism as disarm it you often find yourself liking him while at the same time being aware that he s doing something wrong he is alternately sexy , simian , sensitive and wooden every so often , he seems like a robot with eye shadow but what he lacks in technique , he makes up for in feeling in scenes calling for big emotion , he is sometimes too big but often he is quiet in a way that draws us to him he sings a number of songs , and wonderfully there is still no one like elvis to watch him dance is to see cubism brought to life there is sometimes the sense that his upper and lower body do not belong together , and every so often the bottom half tries to make a run for it what is most appealing in we 're gonna move , poor boy and let me is how much fun he appears to be having in a few short years , when the formula for commercial success had regrettably been discovered and set , you could not find this happiness in his face again he seemed like a singing hologram but in love me tender there is an infectious joy in what he does , and in the title song , which he repeats at the end , you sense a depth of emotion , and a restraint , that appears only erratically in his acting it is a promising debut you feel that in the right hands he could do something solid his next film , loving you \( 1957 \) , is both a step forward and a step back on the positive side , it is prettier to look at it is elvis s first color film , and the color is creamy in addition , in a pattern that would soon be broken , there are several good songs mean woman blues , teddy bear \( sung against a purple scrim sprinkled with stars \) , loving you and livin' , in which he does some of his most irresistible dancing he has acquired more discipline in both his acting , which is still marked by a certain blunt energy , and in his numbers now when he jiggles his leg , it looks like a choice , not a seizure all around , it is a pleasant piece of entertainment but it succeeds by trying for less you do n't have the feeling that he s making so many mistakes , but you also do n't have the excitement of seeing a young talent reach for something his next film , jailhouse rock \( 1957 \) , with another terrific score , is one of his best it is grittier \( back to black and white \) and elvis is quite convincing as a hotheaded excon trying to break into show business his acting is more confident but less emphatic , and he has \( temporarily , it turns out \) acquired the actor s technique of making something out of terrible dialogue when a woman says to him , how dare you use such tactics ! he replies that ai n't tactics , honey it s just the beast in me do n't ask me how , but he puts it over even better , he is frankly sexual in the film he gives a woman a look in a bar that not only undresses but xrays her this is exactly what we want of elvis in the movies it advances what the television appearances only allude to in the flatly innocuous 20odd movies that were soon to follow , you would never know that this was a boy who frightened girls' parents it s as if somewhere after his appearances on ed sullivan s show , he 'd been spayed but in jailhouse rock , you can see what all the fuss was about
denver , may 9 when the mets traded for mike hampton two winters ago , they were asked to do something extraordinary , to overwhelm him with a contract offer the mets waited then hampton won 15 games and was named the most valuable player in the national league championship series again , he asked the mets to anticipate where the market might go and to make him a bold offer the mets waited tonight , the mets faced hampton for the first time since he chose to sign with the colorado rockies as a free agent again , the mets waited they waited for hampton to fizzle , to let the selfinflicted pressure of facing his old team consume him , the way it did when he allowed five runs against his former houston teammates last august they waited to mount a rally they waited to score they are still waiting hampton was outstanding tonight , inducing four double plays to shut out the mets , 60 , on seven hits he also collected two singles it was hampton s first completegame shutout since he blanked st louis in game 5 of the nlcs to put the mets into the world series last fall the mets' rick reed , who went seven innings tonight , did not pitch poorly , but hampton was better it s special because those are my friends over there , hampton said , and you always want to beat your friends hampton has chatted with his former teammates this week , and he received his nl championship ring monday from general manager steve phillips , who said their meeting was cordial and sincere he was glad for the time that he had in new york and the opportunity to play in the world series , phillips said none of us ever knows how often you 'll get an opportunity like that in your career hampton is 50 this season the mets are five games under 500 , at 1419 there can be no direct correlation between those facts , of course , but it is obvious the mets would be a better team had they kept hampton losing him was one of several setbacks in an offseason in which they did not acquire any elite players hampton signed with the rockies for eight years and 121 million , a better offer than the mets' late proposal of seven years for 105 million hampton cited the colorado lifestyle as his reason for leaving phillips essentially said he never believed hampton would return , but hampton insisted the mets had a chance that s their opinion , he said there s one person here that knows the truth they were in the final few hampton did not enjoy dredging up the past , and it was also an uncomfortable topic in the mets' clubhouse manager bobby valentine said there was no reason to wonder about what might have been he s not here , valentine said why would you think about him being here \? but hampton s performance stirred memories of him at his best he got himself in trouble and worked out of it with double plays he lunged for first base against his better judgment , he said to beat out a badhop single that scored the rockies' second run his steely expression never changed robin ventura , who lifted up hampton in the celebration after the final out of the nlcs , said he could understand the emotions of people watching the game but the mets were not trying too hard , ventura said they were simply beaten by one of the best we 've seen him do it last year , ventura said that s what makes him a good pitcher he 'll throw a different set of pitches at you when there s nobody on when people get on , he s going to make you hit the pitch that he wants you to hit that s what makes him tough singles by todd walker and larry walker led to the rockies' first run , in the first inning they added another in the second , through no fault of reed s todd hollandsworth had reached first on an infield single , and reed outlasted ron gant in a 10pitch atbat , introducing his curveball on his last pitch to get gant looking for strike three after another out , reed faced hampton , who flicked a grounder to first but the ball shot up over todd zeile s head , and by the time edgardo alfonzo reached it , hampton and reed were in a scramble for first hampton won the race , arriving just before alfonzo s throw , which reed dropped the rockies led , 20 , and it stayed that way through the sixth , when ventura grounded into an inningending double play larry walker homered in the sixth , and reed had more trouble in the seventh with two outs , he allowed two singles , the second to hampton reed split the nail on his index finger on that pitch , and the trainer fred hina visited him at the mound reed said he was fine and stayed in , but his next pitch , a curveball to todd walker , landed 417 feet away in center field for a threerun homer reed is the mets' no 1 pitcher now , with al leiter hurt , kevin appier searching for consistency and , of course , hampton gone but there were no heightened emotions tonight , reed said not at all , he said i 've gone up against plenty of exteammates , and he has also but none of reed s exteammates is quite like hampton , a pitcher who got away from a team that still needs him inside pitch rick reed did not walk a batter again wednesday , and research by the elias sports bureau found no other starter in the past 30 years who had gone seven starts into the season with only one walk reed , who has worked 52 2 3 innings , also walked none in spring training the lefthander al leiter , who has a strained tendon in his left elbow , is aiming to return may 18 at shea stadium against the los angeles dodgers leiter will throw a simulated game in san francisco on friday the mets could soon have back jose nunez , a 22yearold lefthander they lost to the dodgers in the rule v draft last winter the dodgers designated nunez for assignment , and if he clears waivers , they must offer him back to the mets the mets have considered a trade with the dodgers , but general manager steve phillips would welcome nunez , a reliever with a good breaking ball we like him a lot , phillips said darryl hamilton \( strained neck muscle \) returned to the team and said he was healthy hamilton , who will probably be activated saturday , passed out cigars to celebrate the birth of his son , donovan , his first child photo the former met mike hampton shackled his old team last night at coors field , a hitterfriendly park he induced four double plays to shut out the mets on seven hits he also added two singles to colorado s offense \( associated press \) \( pg d3 \)

chicago , oct 22 a dwindling number of people are going to conventions these days , but those who plyed the cavernous floor of the mccormick place convention center this weekend sounded a lot like randy scholtz , a 49yearold food service manager who insisted he was getting on with life mr scholtz said he was ignoring the television news and not listening to rumors about the possibility of more terrorist attacks instead , he was making strawberry softserve ice cream swirls for the handful of visitors to his company s booth at the worldwide food expo , the giant meat and dairy equipment convention that wrapped up here on sunday the people who are afraid to come are the ones who listen to rumors , said mr scholtz , who flew in from deland , fla , for the show some say , 'do n't go to the malls on halloween' that s another silly rumor on the internet by and large , the exhibitors were here the problem was that the conventioneers the people whose job it is to buy the foodprocessing equipment displayed on the exhibition floor were not convention officials estimated that about 20 percent , or close to 6 , 500 , of the 32 , 000 people expected at the fourday meeting failed to show across the country , the struggle for normalcy is still being lost on the convention front new orleans , orlando , fla , and las vegas have all been hit by a rash of convention cancellations and noshows between the slowing economy and the aftermath of the terrorist attacks , the convention industry expects revenue to drop to about 76 billion this year from 96 billion last year , according to the convention industry council , which is in mclean , va new york had cancellations after sept 11 partly because the jacob k javits convention center was used as a medical site but it is now starting to recover indeed , some large groups have decided to move their conventions to new york as a show of support here in chicago , attendance is weak in what is typically the best month of the year for conventions , and there is a sense that people are putting a happy face on what , for this city , is a big , big business gone bad none of the big conventions has canceled , said james reilly , the chief executive at the chicago convention and tourism bureau but our expectations are much lower on thursday , when the food expo opened , there were gaps in the expected sea of conventioneers who typically clog the aisles of the 14 millionsquarefoot exhibition hall exhibitors resorted to mingling among themselves i hope things get better , said george reiser , a vice president at reiser company , a distributor of meat processing machines that spent about 1 million to set up its oversized stainless steel equipment on the convention floor this is the show for the industry things did not improve much still , chicago , a city that boasted about 32 million visitors and 97 billion in convention and tourism revenue last year , is hoping this is temporary the weakening of the travel and convention businesses is already dealing a serious blow to chicago and the midwest traffic at o'hare international airport , still one of the busiest airports in the world , is down more than 25 percent in the last month , according to several airlines parking and concession revenues are down 30 percent to 40 percent , according to the chicago department of aviation hotel occupancy , which dipped as low as 20 percent in the days after sept 11 , is still below 70 percent at many hotels at a time when occupancy is usually in the low 90 s all this may be why president bush chose to come here last month to encourage americans to get back in the air it is definitely why chicago s mayor , richard m daley , has campaigned to lure people from the suburbs to downtown attractions like navy pier and the shedd aquarium among those who made it to the food expo , it was hard to find people who said they were still afraid to fly many said they wanted to get back to work and not let terrorism destroy their everyday lives i do n't think you can let other people decide how you live , said raymond platter , 60 , who works for borden dairy milk products in conroe , tex his wife , sandra , who joined him for the convention , added , if it s your time to go , it s your time to go some came against the wishes of family members my wife was nervous , said steve valdez , who works for a food packaging company in california my youngest son was nervous , too he s 14 he said , 'dad , why do you have to go \? ' then he called me on my cellphone last night , and that s not normally like him others arrived in chicago with a heightened sense of how dangerous the new world could be john hinners , a trade group official from denver , said a flight attendant on his plane to chicago called him to the front and showed him how to detach the coffee dispenser to get scalding hot water , just in case and julie buffenbarger , an exhibitor from cleveland , said she looked around her plane for suspicious passengers and prepared to use her car key as a weapon many here said the convention business was suffering because of excessive media coverage of the sept 11 attacks they showed that plane flying into the tower so many times that it s embedded in everyone s mind , said mr scholtz , whose company , archibald brothers , designs frozen dessert dispensing systems i have to admit , when we flew over the sears tower the other day , i kept seeing that image people who came here to the last food expo two years ago with a large group of colleagues wandered the halls on the opening day a little lonelier this time four or five of us were supposed to come , but i'm the only one here , said les oesterreich , 57 , of davis , calif , who was ordering room service instead of going out on the town chicago discourages that kind of behavior in normal times , the convention bureau estimates that the typical conventiongoer spends about 300 a day on things like taxis , parking fees , hotels , restaurants , museums and shopping sprees along the magnificent mile but these are not normal times , and people here said that the 2001 worldwide food expo seemed a lot less cosmopolitan than in years past not only were many foreigners absent , in part because of problems obtaining visas , so were many americans from outside the midwest when we look at the name tags , we see iowa , illinois , indiana , wisconsin and minnesota , said james sargent , who was working at the booth of the copesan pest control company a lot of these people drove photos at the food expo in chicago , typically crowded with conventiongoers , exhibitors often resorted to mingling among themselves carol stolarski and mike sigmundson at the food expo in chicago , where attendance was off 20 percent \( photographs by steve kagan for the new york times \)
it s not unusual for a critic to give a restaurant a glowing review only to have a diner disagree the typical complaint might be , i went there and found the food to be terrible and the service to be worse who s right , the critic or the customer \? frequently the answer is both that s because they ate different dishes on different days , often prepared and served by different people it s entirely possible for a restaurant to be terrific one night and terrible the next i know that because of restaurants like the estoril grill , a new 88seat portuguese storefront at 191b north long beach road in rockville centre \( 5167630800 \) on a recent sunday there the a team turned out two or three splendid starters and three very fine entrees while a smooth , sophisticated waiter who knew the menu and its ingredients provided excellent service on monday , almost all of our food had too much salt or none at all nearly everything tasted as though the dishwashers were doing the cooking and an affable , though completely clueless waiter made our lives miserable what follows was taken from notes made shortly after two consecutive visits to the same restaurant first sunday portuguese restaurants are moving up and out , up in class and out of the mineola and farmingville enclaves into the dining mainstream estoril , a slick , classy spot with very manageable prices , is a step up from the rustic ethnic spots that depend on local portuguese neighborhood support it s a white tablecloth place , with warm yellow walls , an open kitchen , potted plants , shaded lighting , a charming little backlighted bar , appropriate dinner music and a red rose in the middle of each table upon being seated , diners get instant attention a basket of good , dense portuguese corn bread appears quickly followed by a familystyle salad of fresh greens , ripe tomatoes , red onion spirals and imported black olives dressed in strawberry vinaigrette it s included in the entree price and makes appetizers unnecessary we tried three anyway , a wonderfully rich chicken soup \( 395 \) thick with shards of chicken , carrots , pastina and chopped hardboiled egg whites a coarse grilled chouri o flamed in grappa \( 695 \) and a crock containing a dozen and a half littleneck clams , slightly too large and chewy , in a garlicfueled buttery sauce \( 895 \) at entree time take note of the kitchen s open woodcharcoal grill and order the precisely cooked meat dishes like the three thick , rosy lamb chops \( 1695 \) that are the equal of six or seven of the tiny , dainty ones served elsewhere , or the substantial rib steak \( 1695 \) loaded with charred , beefy flavor a special of six jumbo shrimp \( 1995 \) saut ed in a lemony whitewinegarlic sauce also made the grade , but homemade potato chips were n't warm and had an acrid aftertaste and two housemade desserts a soupy , hardgrained rice pudding and a flan were ordinary at best wine for as little as 13 a bottle and 8 a halfbottle is a better buy than the pricey soft drinks at 3 a glass now monday after the chewy corn bread and that noteworthy salad , everything fell apart the caldo verde \( 395 \) , or portuguese green soup , took an hour to arrive , and this bland , thickened , gloppy brew , with little shredded kale and one sliver of ling i a sausage , was n't worth the wait the three touchstone dishes at portuguese open charcoal grill restaurants are usually roast suckling pig , barbecued chicken and codfish we ordered all three and had little to show for it the contrast between crisp skin and moist meat makes roast suckling pig \( 1695 \) a favorite ours had rubbery skin and dry , tired meat the scrawny halfchicken \( 1995 \) was so overcooked that even the dark meat retained barely a drop of juice , and the cod \( 1595 \) , or bacalhau assado , was too salty and strongtasting to eat this saltpreserved , boardlike fish must be soaked in water \( which is frequently changed \) over a prolonged period or it s inedible tough , though flavorful , spare ribs \( 1395 \) with a salty surface were n't much of an improvement along the way , our uninformed waiter was driving us daffy he brought the wrong wine , forgot the soup , told us the cheesecake was homemade \( it was n't \) and did n't know if the cod was fresh or salted nor could we understand his explanation of potato and vegetable accompaniments , two potatoes and broccoli or one who knows \? worse yet , instead of asking someone who was informed , he tried to bluff when asked about the fresh or preserved cod he replied it was filleted later he said it was fresh , then indicated it was salted finally he wanted to leave the incorrect wine on the check and give us 15 in cash , rather than change it all this occurred after a very positive experience the previous night making estoril grill one of those jekyll and hyde restaurants where the only constant is inconsistency openings minami , a 65seat japanese restaurant , opened early last month at 12 central avenue in massapequa \( 5167994799 \) the chef and owner , john shangguas , who cooked at higashi in syosset before opening his own place , is preparing an extensive menu with more than 100 selections at entree prices that range from 11 to 23
years after they were banned for use on farm fields in suffolk county , agricultural pesticides continue to contaminate drinking water consumed by thousands of east end residents , testing of water samples by county health officials has revealed but as sophisticated testing equipment at a county laboratory in hauppauge finds a lengthening list of the chemical breakdown products from the once commonly applied pesticides , the state department of environmental conservation has withdrawn funding for further monitoring of private wells in farm areas the chief of the county health department s bureau of groundwater resources , martin trent , said last week that the county would continue to monitor as widely as possible despite the lost state money mr trent confirmed that the conservation department , which is the government agency responsible for administering the state s pesticide reporting law of 1996 , specified that none of the 200 , 000 it provided for testing in highuse pesticide areas this year be spent on private wells in agricultural areas there are an estimated 50 , 000 private wells on eastern long island , many near current or former farm areas they told us they wo n't pay for that portion of the program any longer , mr trent said of course it s easier when you have funding , but we 're not closing up shop he said testing would be paid for out of the department s budget mr trent said he and other health officials were particularly concerned about a scarcity of research on the possible synergistic effect of mixtures of pesticide breakdown products in drinking water what we are finding is wells containing 3 , 5 or even 10 of these compounds , he said that s a cause for great concern when you have that kind of mixture the measurements for separate breakdown products are typically several parts per billion , far below amounts that state agencies consider proven risks to human health two suffolk county legislators , david a bishop of west babylon and george o guldi of westhampton beach , both democrats , charged last week that the conservation department had been pressured by the state department of agriculture and markets and farm and chemical company lobbyists to eliminate money for the well testing the state is reacting in a way that suggests that they do n't like the information and therefore seek to cut it off , said mr bishop , a lawyer and the leader of the legislature s democratic minority i guess their argument is , 'we know it s bad' mr guldi , whose district includes the south fork , called the conservation department decision tragic the conservation department denied that it had been pressured it is simply untrue , said a department spokeswoman in albany , jennifer meicht ms meicht said that since 1997 suffolk officials had tested more than 3 , 000 private wells in agricultural areas using state money we have already established that the private homeowner wells are being impacted , and future testing of private wells is not going to add to that information , ms meicht said the decision to refocus monitoring efforts in other areas , including golf courses and vineyards and other areas , was made in an effort to be proactive and to find out what impacts the use of pesticides might be having in these other areas ms meicht noted that the county health department , which is under contract to her department to test for pesticides under the 1996 reporting law in both suffolk and nassau , had received 800 , 000 in three years of testing , or about half of the total amount available there simply is n't the funding to sample every private well in the county , she said but the county monitoring has also included testing at vineyards and golf courses and has found by far the greatest problems in the farm areas mr trent said annual reports on testing of the east end wells listed 24 chemical breakdown products in 1998 , the first year of testing under the 1996 law in 1999 the number rose to 32 , he said , and last year it reached 44 this year i know we will add a few more , he said he said the higher numbers reflected advances in testing methods at the county s public and environmental health laboratory an analysis of the county testing results by mr bishop , who is chairman of the legislature s environment , land acquisition and planning committee , showed that since 1997 pesticiderelated compounds had been found in more than 50 percent of private wells in agricultural areas of those , mr bishop s analysis showed , 55 percent contained multiple pesticiderelated compounds the percentage of multiple readings rose to 75 percent in east hampton , it said the 1990 census , the most recent data available , showed there were 8 , 000 private wells in east hampton mr bishop said 16 percent of public wells and 10 percent of private wells tested by the county contained pesticiderelated compounds of more than the 50 parts per billion state standard public water is treated to remove the compounds and many private well users filter water mr bishop said the results suggested that as study continued , water in as many as 20 percent of private wells in agricultural areas would be found to fail the state standard he said he would call state officials to a hearing to explain why they vehemently oppose further testing of private wells in eastern suffolk he said that state law preempted the county from legislating its own pesticide regulations the state is our biggest hurdle , he said joseph m gergela , executive director of the long island farm bureau in riverhead , said the minute amounts of compounds being found did not threaten public health and came from pesticides that had not been in use for more than two decades whatever is used now has undergone extreme scrutiny , he said if it is important to do the testing , i am sure the county health department is quite capable of continuing the program regardless of what dec says , he said county testing at vineyards and golf courses showed what appeared to be lesser pesticide problems tests of shallow monitoring wells at five vineyards detected two pesticides , but in amounts the department said were below limits for drinking water the report said these preliminary results , based on 15 wells , suggested groundwater impacts from wine grapes on long island may be limited but the department planned additional monitoring there are now 47 vineyards covering 2 , 700 acres results from 18 monitoring wells intentionally placed down gradient of tees and greens on eight suffolk county golf courses found detectable levels in only two of the wells neither of the readings for the two chemicals detected , metalaxyl and a chemical breakdown product of dacthal , were above drinking water maximums the report said the results suggest that , for chemicals analyzed , current turf management practices at golf courses monitored are effective in controlling pesticide impacts on groundwater mr trent said pesticides applied to grass on golf courses appeared to present less risk than pesticides applied directly to the far more permeable soil of farm fields under cultivation in at least one case , a nowbanned pesticide called temik , whose derivatives remain in groundwater , was deposited in granular form in the furrow with seed potatoes potato farmers last used temik in 1979 , but its metabolites and degradates are still frequently detected in the private well samples , the report said photos at suffolk department of health , water samples , far left , to be tested

downtown residents packed a wall street hotel lobby , and with much shouting and even some crying , vented their fears to a group of local officials who had come to calm them and answer questions many said their distrust comes directly from what they experienced and witnessed on sept 11 the real issue is how can two buildings disintegrate into thin air given all the things in those buildings that were never meant to disappear into the air and that air be perfectly safe to breathe \? asked mary white , who lives in battery park city government officials understand the fury as part of human nature , mr miele said , and point out that the real respiratory concern should be about something much more mundane exhaust new tests show that unfiltered diesel smoke coming from the rescue and construction vehicles now cramming the red zone is the potential new problem nonetheless , residents want independent air testing and are pushing for the creation of a new city position , a nonpartisan environmental advocate who would explain how studies are being done and what the results mean there s tremendous distrust of the information we 're being given , continued ms white , who runs an online business from her home we feel physically sick when we stay there , sore throats , burning eyes , rashes the persistent doubts and fears of residents may actually be deeply rooted in human nature and evolution , and are apt to continue to outweigh any reassurances provided by health or environmental officials , experts on risk communication said we 're designed to react first based on whatever information we have at the time , which is mainly emotional and intuitive factors , said david p ropeik , the director of risk communication for the center for risk analysis at the harvard school of public health but the one thing that may add the most to the confusion is the statistics themselves taken alone , without a full explanation from the authorities , the numbers sound frightening officials have tested for asbestos , metals lead , iron oxide , zinc oxide , copper , beryllium and soot that might create health hazards , as well as other pollutants none of the metals exceeded osha limits tests have revealed occasional spikes in the levels of soot , which seem to be associated with the flareups of fires within the wreckage , state environmental officials said in all cases , the epa and osha , along with the city s department of health , indicated that there was no reason for general public concern the agencies all note that there have been transient spikes in one pollutant or another , particularly near the epicenter of the attacks , but no finding reveals a risk to public health only 27 of 442 air samples exceeded epa safety levels for asbestos , but the mere mention of that substance causes alarm since the first days after the attack , asbestos levels in dust in the red zone have almost all been below the concentration at which the mineral is even technically defined to exist 1 percent of the total mass of a sample the exceptions to those findings have been made by the federal epa and the city s department of environmental protection , which have noted on their web sites certain days and places in the red zone where levels of asbestos in outdoor air exceeded safety standards but those standards were set for air inside buildings , not the air outside , which disperses quickly so while the quality of the air may indeed be below certain safety standards , it is not dangerous , the agencies say asbestos risks increase when someone is exposed to it for a long period often years in a confined space the chances of being affected now are minuscule , the authorities said the agencies said they chose to use the indoor standard to be cautious and because a safety standard for outdoor air does not exist nowhere except near some mines has there ever been a problem with asbestos contamination outside a building , federal and city officials said but the mere fact that the level of asbestos does exceed a known threshold for safety has prompted the calls , email messages and angry questions at meetings you can see the dust , you can taste the dust , you can smell the smoke , said mary mears , a spokeswoman for the environmental protection agency who rides the ferry from jersey city each morning and walks through the red zone to her office on lower broadway i can understand why people are not convinced based on the evidence they see by the time i get to work i feel like i was licking the sidewalk she noted that no agency is saying that the air and dust are absolutely harmless we ca n't call it 100 percent safe , ms mears said if you suffer from asthma , or even if you 're just sensitive , the dust alone can irritate your lungs peter m iwanowicz , the director of environmental health for the american lung association of new york state , said everything i 've seen so far has been consistent with what the regulatory people are saying things are within legal standards and going down over time but downtown residents remain wary at the wednesday night meeting , many said they left the gathering more disturbed than when they arrived i am mystified once again that i am walking out of a meeting with no more information than i came in with , and still unsure if i should be living in my apartment , said donald scherer , president of the battery park city residents' association my wife is pregnant and we 're scared as hell , he said the safety situation has improved substantially at the site itself , officials said dr thomas matte , a medical epidemiologist for the national centers for environmental health who was in new york city to watch for any health threats , said there was virtually no supervision at the attack site of the wreckage removal , with a lot of dust lofted into the air unnecessarily that was unavoidable , with everyone focused on the search for survivors now , though officials are insisting that trucks be covered with tarps , the streets , wreckage and workers are washed down to cut dust photo like many near the world trade center site , nancy graham , left , and janet heussner , wear surgical masks because they say the air smells \( marilynn k yee the new york times \) chart asbestos readings in lower manhattan federal and city air monitors have detected

six months after being dismissed from indiana university for what the university president deemed a pattern of uncivil , defiant and unacceptable behavior , bob knight s storied career as a basketball coach was resurrected yesterday as the new coach at texas tech knight , 60 , wearing a red raiders golf shirt , was warmly welcomed when he was introduced at the packed united spirit arena yesterday in lubbock , tex he immediately donned a red sweater , his trademark during many of his 29 years at indiana but this one had a texas tech logo and it was presented to him by the university s athletic director and his longtime friend , gerald myers this is without question the most comfortable red sweater i 've had on in six years , said knight , referring to his controversial final years with the hoosiers i ca n't tell you how good this sweater feels he promised that his red raiders players would be expected to adhere to high academic standards , pledged an initial 10 , 000 donation to the school library with a promise of more to come and said that the texas tech faithful would enjoy teams that play hard and smart most of the time i'm not right all the time , knight said when it comes to this game , i'm right most of the time knight signed a fiveyear , 125 million contract , and , with incentives , his salary will be boosted to 400 , 000 a year , about 100 , 000 less than the average of other coaches in the big 12 conference he is also taking over a program with little basketball tradition he replaced james dickey , who was fired after the season there are no behaviorrelated clauses in the contract , myers said , other than the standard requirements that apply to all tech employees i think this is the beginning of something special for texas tech and texas tech basketball , myers said we 've got the opportunity to make this program competitive at the highest level of college basketball in praising myers and texas tech s president , david schmidly , knight showed that he remained unhappy with his treatment at indiana under athletic director clarence doninger and myles brand , the university s president he said he looked forward to working with myers , a great athletic director , which is a little bit of a new experience for me knight , however , let his wife , karen , address concerns about his temper and past behavior , which were part of the reason about 100 of the university s 900member faculty signed a petition opposing his hiring she conceded that it had been a difficult year and thanked the people in lubbock they had met for their warm and genuine welcome the one thing that i 've always understood about this man i see every day what i call a huge passion for living , karen knight said he has a huge passion for everything he does do n't judge him until you get a chance to know him last september , after knight had a confrontation with a student , brand fired him and offered a list of transgressions he said violated the zerotolerance policy he laid down on may 15 for knight , who won three national championships at indiana those penalties stemmed from an investigation into an allegation from a former player , neil reed , that knight had choked him at a 1997 practice , an event caught on videotape knight was suspended for three games and fined 30 , 000 knight agreed to the sanctions to save his job he offered a general apology for what the trustees and brand called persistent and systematic abusive behavior not since woody hayes , the former ohio state football coach , was dismissed in 1978 for punching an opposing player during a game , has the fate of a collegiate athletic figure stirred such national debate besides amassing a 661239 record and winning three ncaa titles , knight led the hoosiers to 11 big ten conference titles and coached the united states men s team to the gold medal at the 1984 olympic games but he also displayed a fiery temper he was convicted for hitting a puerto rican policeman before a practice at the pan american games he appeared to kick his son patrick in the shin while the son played for his indiana team , and he once threw a chair across a court none of those moments were relived yesterday you 've got a great , great university , knight said , and i'm really glad to a be a small part of that great university
to the editor when your reviewer of bad news where the press goes wrong in the making of the president \( books in brief , sept 2 \) calls my book an exoneration of the press , he is guilty of the kind of distortion and inaccuracy that he apparently finds in the coverage of political campaigns the reviewer , douglas sylva , accurately cites my description of the media s role in presidential campaigns as enablers for the abuse of the political process by the candidates and their handlers what sylva unaccountably leaves out are the sentences immediately following none of this is to excuse the sins of omission and commission committed by the media it is not just the machinations of the competing campaigns that are to blame in their coverage of campaigns the media at one time or another have been guilty of just about every one of the seven deadly sins and the book is replete with examples of the same that hardly adds up to an exoneration of the press i leave it to sylva to find an exoneration for his review robert shogan chevy chase , md
a relatively unknown family partnership is buying one of the biggest real estate trophies in manhattan citigroup center , the slantroofed , 59story tower that cuts a distinctive silhouette on the midtown skyline eric d hadar and his father , richard , bid 725 million for the silver tower at lexington avenue and 53rd street , preempting other prospective buyers at the very moment many real estate executives were holding their breath , worried that the economy would slow , ending a spectacular real estate boom but if the deal is completed , the hadars are hoping that the purchase of the 165millionsquarefoot building will catapult them from obscurity to the top ranks of new york s real estate families the hadars are expected to sign a contract to buy the office tower this morning from daiichi life investment properties , a japanese insurance company that has owned a major stake in the building since 1987 , said thomas r mcclayton , managing director of jones lang lasalle , an adviser to daiichi they 're going from being a nobody to a big somebody , said peter riguardi , vice chairman of colliers abr , a real estate company there are only so many buildings that have a worldclass identity and that building is certainly one of them eric d hadar , 36 , formed his real estate company , allied partners , in 1993 , when he bought a twostory building in the east village his father , a partner in the firm , had owned the country s largest direct marketing company selling jewelry until 1986 , when he sold it for 100 million in recent years , they have made some shortterm real estate loans and bought a string of 24 properties , including the studio 54 building at 254 west 54th street , 1 east 57th street and 285 lafayette street in manhattan the hadars also own a onethird stake in brown harris stevens , which is buying halstead property company , making it the second largest residential real estate broker in the city although the hadar family has valued its portfolio at more than 500 million , none of it compares with citigroup center , which george twill , president of csfb realty , called a marquee building and the hadars say they are intent on establishing a familyowned real estate empire like the resnicks , the roses , the dursts and the rudins for me and dad , this is a multigenerational asset , eric hadar said in an interview on monday if you look back at the legendary new york real estate families , they 've always built their empires by agreeing to pay up a building like this almost never comes on the market the deal for the tower comes amid a general uneasiness in the new york real estate market , with some prospective bidders for citigroup center suggesting that the hadars paid too much with the turmoil in the stock market and a slowing economy , many real estate executives are concerned that rents and property values may suddenly drop , after reaching record levels over the last four years there s a tremendous amount of uncertainty at the moment , said john d lyons , executive managing director of granite partners , a real estate investment bank but there s lots of capital available for deals historically , real estate has been a hedge against inflation so far at least , office rents have not fallen , just slowed their relentless march upward according to cushman wakefield , the average rent for prime space in midtown jumped 17 , to 6668 in the first nine months of 2000 , but ended the year with a modest bump to 6711 mr riguardi of colliers abr said there was still very little vacant space and new buildings under construction already had tenants , although he expected rents to fall by as much as onethird on the far west side of manhattan and in other onceindustrial areas that had become fashionable for now struggling ecommerce and technology companies the hadars' deal for citigroup center reflects a shift in the kind of buyers prowling the new york real estate market in recent years , opportunity funds and real estate trusts that required huge profits bought most of the skyscrapers that were put on the auction block now the tide is turning in favor of wealthy families and pension funds willing to accept smaller returns as the property appreciates over a long period of time the crown family of chicago and tishman speyer properties , for instance , recently bought rockefeller center when goldman sachs s whitehall fund put the landmark complex up for sale and now the hadars are buying citigroup center this market has always been about prominent families investing in real estate to build their wealth , said darcy stacom of cushman wakefield the 1990 s were an aberration in any event , the sale of citigroup center is akin to threedimensional chess the building , built in 1978 , was a looming monolith cantilevered over st peter s lutheran church in an effort to raise cash a decade later , citicorp sold daiichi a twothirds interest in citicorp center and a onethird interest in the bank s former headquarters at 399 park avenue for 670 million daiichi took the first step toward selling the property in november , when it agreed to a swap with what is now called citigroup , a financial services company daiichi signed a contract to buy the bank s remaining stake in the tower , while the financial company agreed to acquire daiichi s interest in the 39story , 16millionsquarefoot tower at 399 park , which will become the world headquarters for citigroup eric hadar said that he moved quickly in middecember when he heard that citigroup center was about to go on the auction block he notified daiichi that he wanted to make a preemptive offer for the building , before the japanese company accepted any bids real estate executives involved in the auction said that jerry i speyer of tishman speyer properties , abycq rosen of rfr holdings , mortimer b zuckerman of boston properties and steven roth of vornado realty trust all expressed interest in buying the tower , but were somewhat squeamish about paying 750 million , the expected minimum price meanwhile , the hadars quickly made their offer and lined up financing with deutsche bank we were prepared to sign a contract with no outs and a huge deposit , close to 40 million , eric hadar said
derek jeter compared his absence from the yankees to the nightmare every baseball player experiences you hit the snooze button and sleep late but you suddenly think your team has a day game instead of a night game and you are still in your pajamas that is the queasy feeling jeter had while he hit against minor leaguers in tampa and the yankees began their season without him jeter returned yesterday , after opening the season on the disabled list , and he was treated royally by some fans who reacted as if elvis had entered yankee stadium when he trotted onto the field to run sprints orlando hern ndez , who has rehabilitated his sore right elbow , was also serenaded as a returning hero , because it was his first start of the season the yankees had jeter and hern ndez back the toronto blue jays went with chris michalak , a 30yearold who had pitched five ad a third innings in his major league career it was logical to speculate that michalak would be only a footnote in a game in which the 189 million shortstop and one of the elite pitchers in the american league were making their season debuts but michalak was more like a headline than a footnote in his first start , and he made the yankees feel queasy while guiding the blue jays to a 32 victory michalak sweated through the final out in the dugout after jorge posada smashed a tworun homer off billy koch in the ninth inning , the yankees put men on first and second with two out for jeter manager joe torre conceded that he expected a storybook ending , and every fan stood as jeter strode to the plate koch struck out jeter on a cut fastball michalak smiled finally , a major league victory i was anxious to get that first win and get it out of the way , michalak said what better way to end the game than to have the tying run and winning run on \? what can you say \? that was a great baseball game with bundles of ice around his right shoulder and right quadriceps , jeter patiently answered questions about a day with a happy beginning and a sad ending koch had jumped in front of jeter with two fastballs , none faster than 94 miles an hour jeter s bad speed was obviously sluggish jeter leveled the count at 22 before flailing at koch s cutter you 've got to enjoy those situations , jeter said i 'd love to be in that situation again tomorrow he threw a good pitch at 22 hopefully , i 'll get another chance against him koch spoke respectfully of the yankees , yet said we know we can play with these guys we know we can beat these guys michalak pitched as long yesterday as he had in the rest of his major league career , holding the yankees to four hits in five and a third innings jeter had one of the hits against michalak and was 1 for 5 over all , but michalak , a lefthander who had logged 766 innings over eight minor league seasons , stifled the yankees with a tricky sinker , a sneaky fastball and solid control the best chance the yankees had to score against him dissolved when paul o'neill was thrown out trying to steal third with men on first and second and david justice up in the fourth i got caught flatfooted and did n't get a good jump , o'neill said if i do n't get caught flatfooted , it s a different play if mike sirotka were not injured and roy halladay had not foundered in the spring , michalak would probably not have been near the mound but michalak got the start and he now has the memory of taming the threetime defending champions in their backyard for a day , michalak , who has 45 days of service time in the majors , upstaged jeter and el duque and almost wept as he talked about being able to give the game ball to his wife , shannon it just means all the hard work , all of the sweat , th tears and the blood , it paid off , said michalak , who allowed two runs in eight innings against the yankees in spring training it makes it satisfying to go through all those years in towns no one wants to be in hern ndez , who is always fidgety , was even more fidgety on a damp , gray day in which the temperature was in the 40 s el duque was so out of rhythm in a 27pitch first inning that he practiced bringing his right shoulder forward between pitches he gave up a homer to shannon stewart in the third , a rightfield upperdeck blast to jose cruz jr in the fourth and left after a flurry of three hardhit balls in the fifth , trailing by 30 hern ndez said his elbow felt fine after a 95pitch outing and refused to complain about not getting some calls on pitches on the corners that were probably considered strikes last year when the jays got to the stadium on friday , michalak purposely inspected every inch of the 78yearold park michalak walked around the outfield and went to monument park and read about babe ruth because he did not want to feel awed he even stood on the mound to visualize what yesterday might be like it was a rush , michalak said you 've got the most history in baseball , yankee stadium toeing the rubber with the guys from this ballpark \? like i said , it was exciting i'm very excited inside pitch roger clemens , who bruised his lower right forearm during the season opener , was not hindered as he threw between starts and will try to help the yankees avoid a sweep to his former team today clemens will present the jersey he wore while eclipsing walter johnson s american league strikeout record last monday to the hall of fame d'angelo jimenez was optioned to class aaa columbus so derek jeter could be activated photos derek jeter returned from the disabled list and struck out with two on and two out in the ninth \( chang w lee the new york times \) \( pg 1 \) orlando hern ndez , who lasted four and a third innings in his season debut , handing the ball to joe torre \( chang w lee the new york times \) \( pg 3 \)
of all the little businesses on east ninth street just west of tompkins square park , none reflect the street s changes and the enduring influence of the ninth street a1 block association better than i coppi , a tawny restaurant featuring tuscan food and intimate conversation in the early 80 s the site , at 432 east ninth street , housed the notorious kiwi social club , which residents say was a focal point for drug dealing next came a punk mecca , the aztec lounge , whose noise and violence spilled onto the street the block association went to court to shut down the aztec , then fended off a proposed club , paradoxically named no bar about three and a half years ago , i coppi broke the spell when its owners approached the block association even before applying for their business permits the property s bad karma preceded it and so , apparently , did the block association s reputation the two sides negotiated a written accord under its terms the restaurant agreed to serve only beer and wine and to limit seating in its whispering garden to parties of two i live on fourth street between a and b , so i understand their point of view 100 percent , said lorella innocenti , who owns i coppi with her husband , john brennan we tell our customers at the door to please be quiet , to respect our neighbors gone are the huge , cantankerous meetings and publicityseeking rallies that marked the block association s work during the 1980 s and early 90 s those were times when the 400 block of east ninth street was so rife with brazen drug dealing that the block association once recruited the guardian angels and tried to organize around them , recalled alan jacobs , one of the group s founders today , like patrons of i coppi , the block association whispers more than it shouts tightly focused political actions have replaced flirtations with vigilantism , and the group acts only when necessary to protect its street of towering gingko trees and humble early20thcentury row houses if sarah wilkins , the association s mainstay , spots something troubling an empty storefront or a request for a liquor license the response is mostly behind the scenes typically , she will mobilize a network of building captains who in turn will alert their neighbors , who will call public officials in a neverending effort to control noise , traffic and crime drug dealing has subsided , but the east village s rowdy night life and gentrification continue to plague residents and smallbusiness owners , as they do throughout the city , where quality of life issues have replaced crime as block associations' main concerns so , like a creature that looks dead but is only resting , the ninth street a1 block association will rouse itself from dormancy when necessary basically , i find out what s going on and shoot the starter pistol , ms wilkins said and they all show up for the race like east ninth street , new york has grown cleaner , safer and richer and block associations , once a staple of neighborhood life , may be part of the price of prosperity , the earnest victims of their own success block associations have not become extinct new ones are born all the time in response to one problem or another and many , like the 20yearold east ninth street group , remain guiding forces in their neighborhoods but as middleclass stalwarts are frozen out of the housing market by rising prices , many block associations have slipped into hibernation the intangible sense of smalltown security they lent new yorkers , with their common causes and rollupyoursleeves ethic , is more elusive it takes so much work to live in manhattan , to work at our jobs and to pay our rent , people do n't have the time to spend on community affairs , said gerard schriffen , a cochairman of the manhattan neighborhood council , a congress of local groups oncecombative associations are now less visible at one time in the city , not so long ago , crises erupted so regularly that block associations seemed to multiply in biblical proportions they were the dotcoms of the 70 s and 80 s , groups of gogetters , often young , ready to plant gardens , preserve housing , save the city who does n't remember all those neighborhood watch signs , which promoted both public safety and camaraderie \? what i believe , through a block association , is that i can change things in new york , said marilyn appleberg , the longtime president of the 10th and stuyvesant streets block association , which restored parks , started a concert series and successfully opposed highrises , drugs and prostitution that s a very romantic notion today block associations have a more tenuous , less visible role mr schriffen noted that membership in his umbrella group has grown from seven or eight block associations nine years ago to 150 now , but that the same people rarely attend the council s monthly meetings more than once as their concerns wax and wane the citizens committee of new york city , a nonprofit group that promotes block associations with financing , awards and workshops , maintains a list of 7 , 000 active associations , said its president , michael clark mr clark maintains that block associations are as vital as ever but even mr clark , who calls block associations the building blocks that keep civilized society working , acknowledges that they have been buffeted by new challenges in a growing economy
next weekend brings college basketball s national championships , and john wooden , the legendary coach at ucla , is in season three decades ago , andrew hill warmed the bench on mr wooden s championship teams now a television producer , mr hill has written a book on the power of mr wooden s coaching precepts for business leadership mr hill absolutely guarantees that his coach s teachings are a key to success in business and life whether one accepts that sentimental pledge , mr hill s career after graduation has been an authentic instance of how things are supposed to work with college sports that is the special merit of his unpretentious book , be quick but do n't hurry ! finding success in the teachings of a lifetime \( simon schuster , 20 \) in truth , mr hill gives us an account of filial love the book retraces a cycle that sons and fathers have played out in generation after generation rebellious , angry and hurt , the symbolic son escapes the father s shadow only decades later does the son grasp how great a debt he owes the father the two enjoy a reconciliation and live to share the mellowness of friendship as adults and peers by reflex , we tend to save the lessons from sports for our inner adolescent but the power of accomplishment through teams has become today s management orthodoxy sometimes it is possible to be too sophisticated the wisdom of teams , one of the better management books , teaches at some length that a business team is not truly a team unless its members take responsibility for one another books like mr hill s make the point more vividly and more quickly as sure as rain falls , no one will equal mr wooden s accomplishments as a basketball coach in 12 years , the bruins won 10 national championships , including 7 in a row from 1967 through 1973 only six other men s teams have won championships back to back , and none has managed three consecutively at the conclusion of every season , the nation s best player receives the john r wooden award mr hill , a celebrated scorer in high school , rode the ucla bench for three seasons , resentful of every moment he played briefly in 70 games , once victory was assured and fans were filing out , and scored only 100 points a bruins fan called him the man who starts 5 , 000 cars , because when he went in the game , everyone left mr hill craved mr wooden s approval but when he was not ignored , he was in the doghouse on his first day of varsity practice , he petitioned mr wooden to call off the session in observance of a national protest over the vietnam war a request that in retrospect , he says , was colossally dumb mr hill writes that he had found the only person on campus who supported president richard nixon s policy in vietnam more likely , given his account of mr wooden s steely discipline , not even the second coming would have interrupted practice as an adult , mr hill says , he discovered that he was gifted at organizing and managing people engaged in a volatile , creative process and getting them to reach their maximum potential he was once the president of cbs productions , where he produced a halfdozen hit series , most notably touched by an angel coach wooden had actually mentored my entire professional life , mr hill writes and he came to value his basketball experience not as failure but as exceptional accomplishment he was one of a handful of players in college basketball history to be part of three national championship teams his friend bill walton , the team s star , remarked that the bruins' secondstring was the nation s secondbest team after nearly three decades , and with considerable trepidation , mr hill reintroduced himself to mr wooden , who welcomed him with open arms the title be quick but do n't hurry ! expresses mr wooden s insistence on finding lightningfast players who never lose their heads the coach s other precepts are much like the aphorisms loved by coaches everywhere some sound like bumper stickers , but they make an impression on young minds failing to prepare is preparing to fail practice does n't make perfect only perfect practice does keep it simple balance is everything concentrate on what you can control , not on what you ca n't mr wooden , now 90 , always credited his bedrock principle never compare yourself to anyone else to his father , an indiana farmer in the early 1900 s what matters , the coach taught , is becoming the best you are capable of to follow your inner compass , to know that success is open to everyone mr hill takes a score of these precepts and relates each one to a telling episode in his business experience perhaps his most insightful observations have to do with ordinary mortals working in tandem with extraordinarily talented individuals , as was routinely his experience in television in business and basketball alike , he found that the exceptionally talented were the ones who were most likely to coast and to try to rely on their improvisational skills
seattle , oct 9 the cleveland indians and the seattle mariners have come of age together they were among the worst teams in baseball for years , then became regular playoff participants in 1995 since then , the teams have made 10 postseason appearances , but neither has won a world series the mariners have lacked a wellrounded game , the indians an ace in their rotation that might be changing now if the indians have an ace , he is bartolo colon , the hardthrowing righthander who has always seemed on the edge of greatness the mariners won 116 games this season but could do nothing today against colon , succumbing by 50 at safeco field in the opening game of their threeoffivegame american league division series varying the speed of his fastball from 91 to 99 miles an hour , colon held the mariners to six hits over eight innings , striking out 10 seattle managed two base runners in an inning only once as colon emphatically squelched all rallies when colon is at his best , he usually shows a breaking ball he hardly needed to bother with it today , pumping fastball after fastball and daring the mariners to hit it a lot of them were straight , seattle shortstop mark mclemore said a lot of them had movement none of them got hit colon , 26 , has been unable to place himself among the league s elite pitchers since making the allstar team in 1998 , his first full season he has always had a winning record , but he has been wild and inconsistent , his concentration wavering in his final start of the regular season , after cleveland had clinched a playoff spot , colon was knocked out in the second inning he s a biggame pitcher , said the lefthander chuck finley , who will start for cleveland in game 2 on thursday his last start , it almost looked like he was bored because he was ready to get it on i 've seen him do that 10 times already go out there in a game and just dominate that s the way he is still , said ellis burks , the indians' designated hitter , there was concern about colon after his last start on a flight afterward , colon told his teammates to just get him a couple of runs and he would do better next time the indians scored three runs in the fourth inning , and colon made good on his promise it seemed like he was just overmatching those guys the whole day , said burks , who hit a solo home run in the eighth the mariners could not use their preferred lineup against colon manager lou piniella started at least five lefthanded hitters in the mariners' two games against colon this season , but he started just four today outfielder al martin cannot play in the field because of an elbow injury , and carlos guillen is recovering from tuberculosis we do n't have some people that have done a good job for us , piniella said but we 've got no excuses we either win or we do n't no team has won more games in the regular season than the mariners , whose 116 victories matched the major league record of the 1906 chicago cubs but the indians were not intimidated third baseman travis fryman arrived nearly four hours before game time and was surprised to see most of his teammates in the clubhouse guys were just sitting around as relaxed as they could be , fryman said i do n't know how many teams are that relaxed before the first game of the playoffs cleveland really kicked back after its threerun outburst off freddy garcia , the losing pitcher , who had the league s best earned run average this season \( 305 \) roberto alomar led off the fourth with a double to the centerfield warning track , and scored on a brokenbat

gadsden , ala in a patch of land that once held pine , spruce and oak trees , an autoparts maker opened a modernlooking manufacturing plant here five years ago over on the east side of town , another company makes computer circuit boards on a former military base and an hour and a half to the northwest , a telecommunications equipment factory sits in a field that produced cotton a decade ago with great fanfare , much of the southeastern united states diversified its economic base over the last two decades , luring giant auto companies , sprouting new technology centers and raising hopes that the region would not just enjoy greater prosperity but also weather hard times better in the future than it had in the past instead , the opposite has happened even before sept 11 , the interior south stretching from alabama into mississippi , arkansas and louisiana and up through tennessee and kentucky was mired in its worst downturn in almost two decades in the weeks since the attacks , the recession here has only deepened , as consumer spending has weakened and the manufacturing sector has been hit by another blow with the country at war , some executives are even discussing whether they should begin to pursue military contracts for the first time in years partly because of the region s efforts to diversify , and partly in spite of them , the old bible belt has become the nation s new rust belt , suffering first and worst from the nation s economic distress the rural south is to this recession as detroit was to the 1980 s recession , said mark zandi , the chief economist at economycom , a west chester , pa , consulting firm that closely follows regional trends through early september , the sixstate region had lost 36 , 000 jobs this year more than twice as many , per capita , as the rest of the country according to the government s most recent statebystate employment figures as was the case in the midwest in the mid1980 s and in the northeast at the beginning of the 1990 s , many people here are wondering whether the current downturn in the south augurs years of struggle or will serve as a painful but necessary cure for today s ailments on the one hand , the economic decline could clear out some of the region s weaker businesses and force others to become stronger , much as american car companies emerged from the devastation of the 1980 s in a better position to compete with the japanese and europeans the economy of today is a transitional one , gov ronnie musgrove of mississippi said in an interview companies that have moved to mexico and the caribbean , seeking lower labor costs in the wake of the north american free trade agreement , would have left the region eventually , he added , and now local officials and business leaders can focus on attracting betterpaying jobs by improving the region s schools but many residents are worried that without the large corporate headquarters that nearby states like georgia and texas have , much of the region will soon lack both highpaying work for college graduates and solidly middleclass jobs that high school and community college graduates have long relied upon in gadsden a small city that sits astride the coosa river in the appalachian foothills , 60 miles northeast of birmingham college graduates say there are virtually none of the opportunities available in places like atlanta or houston and many lesseducated workers have struggled to find any job that can pay their bills since a large steel mill closed last year since the spring of last year , gadsden has lost about 2 , 000 jobs , or roughly 5 percent of the city s total since those numbers were compiled , the goodyear tire and rubber company , gadsden s biggest employer , said it would eliminate about 200 of its 1 , 400 jobs analysts attribute the harshness of the region s downturn here to two fundamental causes , neither of which shows signs of letting up for one thing , globalization and freer trade have hastened the long decline of the south s old industries , like lumber , steel and textiles , by easing the move of businesses to countries with lower wages the high value of the dollar , reflecting investors' continued longterm confidence in the united states , has only added to that pressure by making foreignmade goods less expensive compared with american products equally important , many of the south s newer industries sell their products not directly to consumers but to major companies , which have caused much of the national slowdown by sharply cutting back on business investment the south s downturn , said ferrel guillory , the director of a regional studies program at the university of north carolina , is a combination of the collapse of the old economy accelerating and the new economy being shaken when gulf states steel filed for bankruptcy last year , citing overseas competition , it left 1 , 700 gadsdenarea residents without work at the time that new local employers , like makers of auto parts and computer chips , had themselves begun cutting workers' hours and laying some off

apeldoorn , the netherlands in the lounge of his brothel , andre van dorst sits in the glow of a red lamp shaped like a huge voluptuous mouth and slaps document after document on the table from the health department , from the police , from the tax department , the labor department they just go on and on , he fumes this one says how the girls have to wash their frilly underthings in practically boiling water and this one says they have to cut their nails very short for hygiene purposes , of course and here they have to have a pillow in the room you do n't want a pillow in your room it s a murder weapon like many an entrepreneur , he laments , the bureaucrats are busy making rules and they know nothing about the business prostitution has long been legal in the netherlands , but now the nation is trying to invent a system to regulate the industry nine months ago it legalized brothels the new law is intended to help the police get a grip on the often suspicious world of prostitution , basically a cash business that the police say is often used for money laundering , arms sales , drug sales and the often brutal exploitation of prostitutes , including minors and illegal immigrants and the law is supposed to offer the more than 30 , 000 women who work as prostitutes in the netherlands the chance to get the basic labor rights , insurance policies and disability payments enjoyed by other citizens but the transition has been a bumpy one police officials say they finally have the means to clean up the sex industry but brothel owners are complaining that they are being inundated with stupid rules and overwhelmed by renovation costs that may force them to close meanwhile , prostitutes are complaining that the law that was supposed to help them has so far only handed them a tax bill the dutch , it turns out , are far less tolerant than expected legalization has done nothing to diminish the taboo associated with the sex trade prostitutes who are trying to set themselves up as selfemployed businesswomen are finding that accountants , banks and health insurance companies want nothing to do with them and many experts are worried , too , that the new law is simply pushing a huge number of prostitutes underground , where they are at greater risk of being taken advantage of this group includes illegal immigrants , who fear being sent out of the country if they register , and dutch citizens who are not ready to go public with what they do i have often doubted since we legalized the brothels , whether we did the right thing , said femke halsema , a member of parliament who advocated the measure for me , it was a question of emancipation and liberation for the women but for now it is working the other way last year , there were nine women working in mr van dorst s brothel , which operates behind his sex shop in the main shopping area of this prosperous town about an hour s drive from amsterdam today , there are only two who take their customers up the steep stairs to two windowless rooms with pink bedspreads and floortoceiling mirrors they charge about 60 for sex mr van dorst gets about 20 of that for renting the rooms one of the women who has worked here for about 10 years said that some of the prostitutes simply left the business because they did not want to lose their anonymity by registering with the police and paying taxes others , she said , were still selling sex , but in a more dangerous way they advertise in local magazines and meet their customers in hotel rooms to do this , most rely on a pimp for protection i do n't see anything good about the law , she said the whole thing is crazy no one is yet calling for a repeal of the law most prostitute advocacy groups maintain that the legalization of brothels will be a good thing in the long run but right now , they say , too little money has been spent on getting information to the prostitutes about how to comply with and benefit from the law , or on campaigns to encourage community acceptance it s chaotic out there right now , said mariska majoor , a former prostitute who runs the prostitution information center in amsterdam s red light district it s not good for anybody most of the prostitutes do n't have any idea where they are in all of this in changing its laws on brothels , the netherlands is again in the forefront of social and legal innovation this year the country became the first in the world to legalize euthanasia and to give samesex marriages the status of heterosexual marriages as usual , what happens here is being carefully studied by the rest of europe legalizing brothels had been under debate for nearly two decades before it became law on oct 1 last year in the 1980 s , experts say , the debate revolved around feminist arguments of empowerment but by the 90 s , as the industry grew , it was law enforcement concerns that carried the day the law finally passed easily , with a twothirds majority in the upper house what we saw over time is that the ministry of social services faded into the background and the ministry of justice took on a bigger and bigger role in putting forward the legislation , said marieke van doorninck , an expert at the mr a de graaf foundation for research on prostitution the emphasis today has been to get legal control over a work place that was a great cover for all sorts of illegal activity the emphasis has not been on decent labor conditions
alfonso soriano dived headfirst into third base last night and eric chavez may or may not have tagged him before soriano s hand touched white umpire rick reed called soriano out , and before soriano finished wiping the dirt off his uniform , george steinbrenner had dived headfirst into general manager brian cashman s box to commiserate and complain hearing steinbrenner , the yankees' principal owner , moan about the umpires during the postseason is as routine as seeing the yankees compete in the postseason steinbrenner does not like umpires he is not bashful about expressing his distaste with the umpires when a call goes against the yankees in october , he reacts faster than manager joe torre and faster than the rowdiest fan at yankee stadium so steinbrenner stood in the back of cashman s box and watched several television replays of soriano trying to steal third in the third inning the replays were inconclusive one made it seem soriano was safe another made it appear he was out to steinbrenner , it was clear that soriano was safe and he criticized reed to reporters who were nearby but steinbrenner was only getting warmed up after david justice was called out for interference as he ran to first two innings later , steinbrenner emerged again he griped to reporters about the umpires some more , his tone becoming louder and his patience growing thinner as the yankees lost to the oakland athletics , 53 , in game 1 of their division series tough series , two good teams , playing with these kind of umps , steinbrenner said we have a lot of explaining to do i hope you guys ask them about it justice had trickled a ball up the firstbase line and catcher ramon hernandez s underhand toss to first hit him in the back dana demuth , the homeplate umpire , called justice , who ran along the grass part of the baseline , out according to rule 605 \( k \) , it is a judgment call for an umpire to decide if the runner prevented the fielder from catching the ball justice beat the throw , but since it was a judgment call , steinbrenner was wasting his breath by arguing that did not stop him it s just tough to compete against a team as good as they are with the umps being less than good , steinbrenner said he ran on the grass \? i 've seen a million guys do that it s a questionable call because justice had reached first before the throw arrived , torre said it should not have mattered that the ball hit him torre argued with demuth and said demuth told him good point about justice already reaching first , but that he was not changing his call none of the umpires were willing to speak with reporters in a statement , demuth addressed only justice s play , stating he was inside the baseline he interfered with the catch it s in the rule book if he was n't , who knows what would have happened \? steinbrenner groused about several calls , even some that were not close he shouted about a play at first , even though tino martinez s foot was off the base he complained about a bloop hit by the a s that was correctly ruled fair but that steinbrenner felt was not steinbrenner did not talk about bernie williams being called out in the eighth on what looked like a double play , which would have ended the inning before martinez s tworun homer steinbrenner contradicted himself as he longed for more veteran umps , mentioning richie garcia but the six umpires who worked last night had a combined 61 years of experience only greg gibson , the rightfield umpire , had not worked at least one postseason series try to talk to them , steinbrenner advised reporters maybe they 'll explain it to you i ca n't explain it it is behavior like last night s that caused steinbrenner to be fined 50 , 000 during the 1995 division series , and 25 , 000 during the 1998 alcs , both times for inappropriate remarks about umpires another fine could be imminent the soriano play occurred with the yankees trailing , 10 , and derek jeter batting in the third inning soriano tried to steal on the first pitch reed called him out , a critical play because jeter followed with a single that would have tied the score soriano said reed did n't have a good angle on the play and added , i thought i was safe when asked about the call , steinbrenner said not very good but it s reed i 've known him a long time reed is the same umpire who called boston s jose offerman out at second base in the 10th inning of game 1 of the 1999 alcs , even though the ball popped in and out of the webbing of chuck knoblauch s glove on a forceout the call helped kill boston s rally and the yankees won on bernie williams s homer in the bottom of the 10th a day later , reed admitted he botched the call since that call favored the yankees , perhaps steinbrenner was referring to reed s call in a game in may 1988 , when walt weiss hit a low liner that the yankees thought bobby meacham had caught reed ruled that meacham had shorthopped the ball and billy martin rushed onto the field and threw dirt at the umpires steinbrenner supported martin and hated reed s call it was a bad call , a very bad call , steinbrenner said at the time umpires are capable of making bonehead calls , and that was a bonehead call thirteen years later , steinbrenner was still grousing photo joe torre argued with the plate umpire dana demuth after david justice \( 28 \) was called out for interference at first base in the fifth inning \( chang w lee the new york times \)
the year was 1936 the oscars were a decadeold affair , working their way up from what was , in essence , a fancydress bash and awards ceremony thrown by louis b mayer to quiet the grumbling from the actors guild , and to spread the favors around , frank capra , head of the academy of motion picture arts and sciences that year , instituted the supporting actor and actress categories no purer than the other categories , the supporting actress nominees and winners followed their own wayward path , choices dictated by a patchwork of motives , not excluding merit , but generally mixed with one or more from column b hollywood politics , guilt , sympathy , anglo snobbery , gimmickry , political correctness , puritanism it was a good place to reward aging divas , precocious children , bright newcomers , foreigners , neglected favorites and sinister and disreputable films and performances that might be thought too outr for the major awards as often as it got the right person in the right film , the academy conferred honor on the right person in the wrong film the wrong person in the right film , or the wrong person in the wrong film gale sondegaard , the first winner for her stock villainess in anthony adverse , or the forgotten josephine hull in the lightly regarded harvey \( 1950 \) , have n't stood anybody s test of time there was always a good deal of maneuvering , studios demoting lead actresses and promoting supporting actresses in order to improve their chances cries of foul ! followed by rule changes , followed by more of the same and absurdities have always existed jessica lange s winning the best supporting actress award for her role in tootsie \( 1982 \) is no more or less ridiculous than eva marie saint s winning the same for on the waterfront \( 1954 \) , when both were obviously and enchantingly the leading women in the films but in the early years , there was at least some rhyme or reason to the choices , an almost predictable pattern , compared with those of recent decades , when the tendency has been almost overwhelming to give stars and starstobe the award rather than supporting types and when the latter have been appropriately rewarded , it has been in a vacuum , profiting them little in that increasingly elusive thing called career less a ticket to stardom or even steady work ! than a kiss of death have been the supporting actress awards won by mercedes ruehl \( the fisher king \) , marisa tomei \( my cousin vinny \) and mira sorvino \( mighty aphrodite \) , who went pretty much nowhere after being heralded and fussed over in 1991 , 1992 and 1995 , respectively the 90 s show the kind of motley choices and muddied thinking that have characterized the award of late anna paquin , child star \( the piano , 1993 \) juliette binoche \( the english patient , 1996 \) and kim basinger \( la confidential , 1997 \) , leading lady types in secondlead roles and angelina jolie \( girl , interrupted , last year \) in the genre of slightly louche and likely to selfdestruct and in the 80 s , we had dazzlers like meryl streep , jessica lange , anjelica huston and geena davis winning supporting actress awards not that they did n't deserve them , but somehow that was n't what hollywood had in mind when the category was invented in fact , though a certain catchall amorphousness may be inherent in the category , there was a time when more consistency was in evidence , largely because hollywood itself was more of a closed system as is evident in the basic narrative architecture of their movies , the studios were built around a whole range of lead and character types , under contract , making two , three films a year bette davis was a star , while the women who surrounded her mary astor , miriam hopkins , thelma ritter , celeste holm , fay bainter were , by definition \( ie , the size of their names on the credits \) , her satellites the best actress award was for the likes of davis , ingrid bergman , katharine hepburn and norma shearer , and the supporting actress oscar was supposed to be for people who would never be leads , bridesmaids who would never be brides there was a characteractress type not the beauty , but beauty s handmaiden mothers , servants , sisters , rivals , all revolving around the heroine in a solar system where planets of descending importance were as essential to celestial health and happiness as the sun itself now typecasting is considered a fate worse than death but in the 30 s , 40 s and even the 50 s , each studio s roster of types stood out vividly , icons on the horizon , targets for whom screenwriters could tailor roles and with whom audiences could identify hear the name and you could hear the voice , see the face and name the epithet that conjured up that particular presence for all time thelma ritter , cynical but softhearted , nominated six times but never a winner claire trevor , saltoftheearth gangster s moll hattie mcdaniel , toughlove mammy character actresses were older than the heroines , or younger , fatter or thinner there was such an abundance that some never got nominated at all , and others una merkel , with a voice like a fire alarm joan blondell , the golddigger reporter girl about town were only acknowledged when past their depressionera prime they were ditzy , bluesy , blowsy , sarcastic , dithery , scheming there were tramps and busybodies , b girls and founts of wisdom , dowagers and prudes they were good , kind mothers , like fay bainter \( jezebel , 1938 \) and jane darwell \( the grapes of wrath , 1940 \) , and occasionally notsogood mothers , like gladys cooper , nominated for her performance as the stiffnecked bostonian who made bette davis s life hell in now , voyager \( 1942 \) , and jo van fleet \( winner in 1955 for east of eden \) , who was a madam as well as a mother , and sadly as far as james dean was concerned better at the former than the latter
yesterday afternoon at 2 in soldout trinity church , dr owen burdick lifted his arms and plunged the rebel baroque orchestra into the start of the overture for the church s annual messiah but there was something different about the chorus in place of the usual choir robes , the singers were in elegant concert garb the men in dark suits with red ties , the women in long black skirts or gowns , flecked here and there with color it s not that the trinity church choir is going secular this season it s just that the choir robes were contaminated on sept 11 the church , at broadway and wall street , is just blocks from the world trade center site messiah is a christmas tradition , and trinity s annual messiah is one of new york s most traditional the work was first performed at the church in 1770 , making this messiah the oldest in the country dr burdick , the church s music director , also tries to stay true to original performance practice the rebel baroque orchestra \( pronounced rebell \) plays period instruments instead of soloists getting up in shiny dresses , as he put it , members of the choir trade off in the solo parts , and instead of pausing between numbers for applause , they perform the piece straight through but a lot of traditions did not survive sept 11 remarkably trinity s buildings the church and st paul s chapel , a few blocks north both did and mercifully none of the church s 150 employees were killed still , as the staff members tried to pick themselves up , literally , out of the rubble , holiday performances were among the last things on anyone s mind what remain are vivid memories of horror dr burdick described looking out trinity s back door and seeing the first tower begin to fall virtually on top of him shutting the door could not keep out the tragedy the church was full of the dust , he said last week there were no open windows it s a church , it s stained glass but the stuff came in through the leading of the windows the foulsmelling cloud that blanketed the area in a silent gray shroud came ballooning into the building , filling eyes , noses and the 9 , 000plus pipes of the church organ , silencing the instrument perhaps forever three months later life seems to have returned to trinity reopened for worship on nov 5 , the church s interior has the appropriate respectful library hush the gift shop is open a few tourists browse museum exhibits yet the air still has a slight biting , acrid quality there is no phone service , and the administration is still based in temporary quarters in a building the church owns above canal street st paul s chapel has become a 24hour haven for rescue workers , offering food and a place to sleep you cannot even get into the building without an emergencyworker card the church s rector , the rev dr daniel p matthews , said , we are not back to normal at all the church was in the frozen zone for seven weeks , cut off from its normal revenue just keeping st paul s chapel open around the clock costs 3 , 500 a day and putting on messiah , dr burdick estimates , costs about 20 , 000 it seemed the annual performance was out of the question but wqxr , the classicalmusic radio station owned by the new york times company , was looking for a special way to commemorate this difficult christmas the station had also been thinking about ways to mark its 65th year of broadcasting \( its anniversary was dec 3 \) , and it was looking for an event to inaugurate its new relationship with xm satellite radio , a digital service that has some 100 stations across the country we knew of the quality of the choir there , thomas j bartunek , the president and general manager of wqxr , said of trinity given the church s location near ground zero , its music program seemed an ideal candidate , mr bartunek said , both for our own purposes and larger purposes of symbolism so we began inquiring , 'what are you folks doing are you doing the messiah \? ' he said and the answer was , 'actually , we 're not' my reaction was , money s got to be in it somewhere , mr bartunek continued , and what if we pay for it \? and they said , 'absolutely' for wqxr this was a departure the station had never underwritten an event its support will give trinity s messiah a longer life in more ways than one in addition to the live broadcast yesterday , the event will be on xm radio on dec 23 at noon , dec 24 at 4 pm and christmas day at 2 pm the period after sept 11 was a time when the audience needed our music more than ever , mr bartunek said this is an extension of that and helping to make sure a tradition continues that close to ground zero is a way to assert that these things will continue once the messiah was back on the calendar , there was a lot of scrambling usually the event is planned at least six months in advance now , there was a month actually conducting it will be the easy part , dr burdick said on friday as he prepared to cart 750 programs up to the church of st vincent ferrer at lexington avenue and 66th street , where the chorus and orchestra gave an advance messiah performance on friday evening
washington , oct 27 within hours of the terror attacks on sept 11 , law enforcement officials say , fbi agents intercepted telephone calls in which suspected associates of al qaeda in the united states were overheard celebrating the attacks on the world trade center and the pentagon in the following days , the officials said , agents swept in and arrested them and have been holding them since , some as material witnesses , based on the information picked up in the phone calls they are among hundreds of people detained after the attacks agents made the requests for the intercepts barely minutes after the planes crashed into the world trade center , knowing from past terrorist acts that osama bin laden s followers often phoned to congratulate one another after successful operations the agents' requests quickly paid off while the precise contents of the intercepted phone calls have not been disclosed , officials have said some were congratulatory , even gloating yet it remains unclear whether the people involved in the conversations were participants in the plot , or merely exulting in the audacity and destructiveness of the attacks on the american enemy the authorities have not said whether any of the people detained on the basis of the intercepts were cooperating , but none have been charged with crimes related to sept 11 law enforcement officials have said that , before sept 11 , they did not believe they had sufficient evidence to ask a court to authorize wiretaps of people suspected of being al qaeda sympathizers but after the attacks , the requests were quickly approved among the people arrested as a result of these intercepts and other information are several material witnesses in the case , the officials said , although they would not identify them or discuss the contents of the intercepted communications they did say that the tone of the conversations was happy good cheer at the success of the attacks , a pattern of behavior that paralleled what occurred after the bombing of the united states embassies in kenya and tanzania in august 1998 the officials would not say how many people were detained through the telephone intercepts , nor would they discuss evidence that any of them proved to be al qaeda members or other militants planning specific terrorist actions the intelligence officials said , however , that the intercepts and the resulting arrests helped form the basis of assertions by senior government officials that they thwarted separate terrorist plots in the days after sept 11 the most that law enforcement officials said about the fruits of the detentions arising from the telephone intercepts was that they believed they had netted al qaeda sympathizers who might have been in the very early stages of terrorist plots intelligence officials said they had aimed their efforts at bin laden associates because they believed it was impossible to catch mr bin laden through electronic intercepts officials said they had learned that he had made it a firm practice since august not to use or even go near electronic communications devices one official said intelligence reports showed that mr bin laden began this practice because he believed that israel was able to assassinate a palestinian leader in ramallah on aug 27 after tracing electronic emanations from his cellphone one official said mr bin laden now used associates as messengers , who make cellphone or satellite calls after they have left him this official said previous reports that mr bin laden had called his wife in syria shortly before the sept 11 attacks to advise her to return to afghanistan were incomplete in fact , the official said , mr bin laden had someone else call his wife with that message the call was made away from mr bin laden s hideaway as of today , united states law enforcement authorities say they have arrested 977 people in connection with the investigation into the sept 11 attacks the bulk of those arrested have been charged with immigration violations or criminal violations a far smaller group is being held on material witness warrants mindy tucker , the justice department spokeswoman , said this week that the authorities had not released most of the names of those held because the identities of some material witnesses were under seal she said the department would not disclose the names of those arrested on immigration violations because privacy issues must be resolved but many civil liberties advocates have said they are worried that the large number of arrests may be improper david cole , a lawyer with the center for constitutional rights , said , it s remarkable how little information is available about these people mr cole added it begins to feel like those countries where they lock people up and do n't tell anyone about it that s not how this country was run until sept 11 one senior law enforcement official said the new wiretaps principally produced information about al qaeda associates in the united states and their activities but investigators have not learned more about the sept 11 attacks from those detained the wiretaps being used against al qaeda are authorized by a special court in washington that hears requests from the government to conduct surveillance against anyone who may be connected to a foreign intelligence operation the new antiterrorism law signed by president bush on friday is supposed to make it easier for federal investigators to obtain eavesdropping authorization under the law , officials have to assert only that foreign intelligence is a part of their need before that , it had to be the only purpose in addition to the efforts against al qaeda , officials said they renewed their interest in people who might know something about the crash of egyptair flight 990 off nantucket in october 1999 , suspecting a connection but officials said they had not determined any link between that crash and the attacks of sept 11 united states investigators say they feel strongly that the crash was the result of an unexplained suicide effort by the plane s copilot , but egyptian officials have angrily rejected that conclusion under the law that created the special court , the foreign intelligence surveillance act , the subjects of eavesdropping may be american citizens or foreigners the surveillance act , first passed in 1978 after watergate and other revelations of abuses by the federal bureau of investigation and the central intelligence agency , created a legal framework allowing the government to spy on suspects considered dangerous to american national security this year , the justice department and the fbi began an investigation of formal requests to the court that administers these requests after complaints that agents had sought to eavesdrop on people who were already subjects of criminal investigations apparently a violation of the rules despite the recent problems , applications to the special court have surged in the last decade , for espionage and terrorism investigations last year , the government made 1 , 005 applications under the act for electronic surveillance and physical search warrants , according to an april report from attorney general john ashcroft to congress the court approved 1 , 003 of the applications in 2000 and the final two in january 2001

new york city did not realize just how hot the market for foreign teachers had become until schools chancellor harold o levy sent recruiters to madrid in the spring there , the astonished new yorkers ran into school officials from connecticut , maryland , massachusetts and washington all eager to lure teachers to the united states from spain more evidence of stiff competition emerged early this month , when city recruiters learned that florida was offering enticements to mathematics and science teachers from austria new york has hired more than 100 austrian teachers since 1998 , and so far , the austrian government has rejected attempts by other school systems to recruit its teachers but alfred posamentier , a city college professor who has helped the board of education s recruiting effort in austria , said that austrian officials had alerted him about a recent visit by florida recruiters in an email message , one official reported that florida was dangling incentives like mentors for each austrian recruit i was n't surprised , dr posamentier said , because florida had been calling me incessantly , asking , 'can we have your leftovers \? can we take some of your people \? ' three years after new york city made international headlines by recruiting a small number of austrian teachers to help fill shortages in math and science departments , most of the nation s other large school systems are searching abroad for teachers who can at least temporarily fill a growing number of classroom vacancies atlanta , chicago , houston and los angeles have all stepped up foreign recruiting this year , as have maryland , massachusetts and a number of other states , creating competition for sources that new york had hoped to tap most of the foreign teachers will work in math , science , special education and bilingual education , according to recruiters for various school systems but despite the intense competition , new york remains far ahead of the pack the board of education plans to hire more than 800 teachers from about a dozen countries for september , up from just 53 from austria and germany in the 20002001 school year board officials said that the recruits , many of whom have already accepted job offers , were from austria , germany , hungary , italy , spain , canada and several caribbean countries most will teach in the roughly 100 city schools that the state has identified as failing , because those schools have chronic vacancies mr levy , who with the foreign instructors has already hired 4 , 700 teachers for this fall and still needs to find 3 , 300 more , said that the foreign teachers were not an ideal solution to the shortage but he said that until the city negotiated a new contract for teachers that included substantial raises , it would not be able to find enough homegrown recruits these are useful and hopefully successful sources of additional teachers , but very much on the margin , mr levy said in an interview yesterday none of this is a substitute for growing our own the chancellor said he had expanded the board s international recruitment efforts because he and other education officials were impressed with the austrians who have taught in city high schools over the last three years the number of austrian and german teachers will grow to about 90 this fall , up from 53 in the 20002001 school year , dr posamentier said joyce coppin , the head of teacher recruitment for the board of education , said that the board had also hired about 150 canadians from toronto and vancouver , many of whom would teach math and science every foreign teacher hired by the board must have a degree in the subject he or she teaches , a state requirement that makes it difficult to find qualified math and science teachers , ms coppin said for the first time , the board also recruited in jamaica , barbados and trinidad and tobago , where they hired about 550 teachers , ms coppin said most of those recruits will teach elementary and middle school in central brooklyn , the south bronx and southern queens , which have growing caribbean populations the illfated trip to spain netted only about 20 teachers , most of whom will teach bilingual education at elementary schools in the bronx , board officials said the board also hired about 40 teachers from italy during a visit there last week , the officials said we picked the countries very carefully , ms coppin said we did n't want to spread ourselves all over basically , the board focused on countries whose teachers could meet particular needs in new york city schools math , science and bilingual education in particular the board was also eager to hire caribbean teachers because of the city s fastgrowing caribbean student population most of the new recruits are coming on what is known as a j1 visa , under which they can stay up to three years under a special classification of research scholars like the austrians who have been coming since 1998 , they will get some training at the city university of new york and at the board s center for recruitment and induction the canadian teachers will come on h1b visas , which are generally given to foreigners coming to work for a specific employer and are good for three years , with the possibility of a threeyear renewal the canadians can stay longer because that country s teacher education programs replicate ours almost exactly , said charles mackey , executive coordinator of the state s office of teaching mr mackey said that the state education department had two experts in comparative education , who determine whether teachers from other countries are qualified to teach in new york the foreign teachers will start arriving in new york in early august e board is already planning for 20022003 mr levy has put out requests for proposals from immigration lawyers and from companies that specialize in recruitment of foreign teachers a small but growing business the president of one such company , teachers placement group in plainview , on long island , said this week that he hoped to help new york hire teachers from india the president , michael vanjani , said his company had already placed indian teachers in cleveland , baltimore , philadelphia and newark , charging the school districts a fee for each recruit we have been talking to new york for the past year and a half and we hope to have some positive results soon , mr vanjani said we want to handle new york chart teachers wanted the number of teachers recruited from foreign countries is expected to increase next year in some of the nation s largest school disctricts chart tracks teachers recruited from foreign countries and projected recruitment of teachers
vladivostok , russia when you ride the transsiberian railroad from this pacific seaport to moscow , you spend a week traveling 5 , 778 miles with strangers and keep in mind that once you have lugged your suitcases to the station , none of you will have a real chance to bathe you share a compartment with three other passengers , sleeping on a mattress rolled out on a padded bench irritable conductors sometimes keep one toilet locked for their own use , creating lines at the other those who ca n't afford the dining car often end up surviving on flyspecked drumsticks or cabbage pies sold by vendors at stops along the way perhaps this is why kim jong il , north korea s dear leader and godlike head of state , decided to forgo the transsiberian and travel in his own train during his state visit to russia he elected to ride from pyongyang to moscow in a 21car , japanesebuilt armored train , with two engines going ahead but mr kim is missing something as many who have traveled the transsiberian will attest , its trains offer a rare chance to glimpse the heart of a great nation perhaps mr kim recalls me i was on the no 8 from birobidzhan to vladivostok last week , and we pulled off on a spur south of khabarovsk so his armored train could flash by we probably looked uncomfortable it was a hot night , and children in their underwear were hanging out the windows i was the guy with the farmer s tan who was swatting the mosquitoes that swarmed through the open windows , attracted by the reading lamps what s the delay \? somebody asked the conductor said , i just saw this armored train , and they say it s that korean bigwig it s a shame , though , if it was the appearance of trains like mine that drove mr kim from traveling in the russian carriages he should be just the kind of person who would cherish a journey on the transsiberian he told the itartass news agency last week that his hobbies include going among the people and soldiers and talking with them and sharing their feelings a train offers opportunities for going among all sorts of people at mealtime , you can share sausage and canned fish and a bottle of vodka with a mongolian trader or a cheerful alcoholic who turns out to be head of a regional antiorganized crime unit any secondclass car is crowded with soldiers who would be happy to hear a foreign statesman s ruminations on the marxistleninist implications of hazing mr kim is said to like reading , which the trains offer plenty of time for his wellknown fondness for music could also be accommodated the trains' loudspeaker systems periodically play pleasing tunes , including the theme to the godfather and if he had been willing to share a bottle of johnny walker red with the american oil workers i met on a transsiberian train several years ago , he might have found himself joining in singing , wild thing , you make my heart sing security , of course , is always a concern for heads of state choosing unconventional travel when president gamal abdel nasser of egypt drove through the desert to morocco in 1956 , a camel caravan had to precede him , in case there were land mines in the sahara and the french navy interrupted shipping traffic in the north atlantic for the better part of a month in 1967 when charles de gaulle cruised to quebec but russians are a gracious people i know the passengers in my train would have been willing to be inconvenienced if it meant they could share a compartment with kim jong il and once the cars get moving , he would have found , things are really quite comfortable the mosquitoes do n't come in until you stop
the recent announcement by the indian drug company cipla that it would sell aids therapy for 600 a year or less to african countries is a step toward commuting the death sentences now hanging over the 25 million africans infected with hiv , the virus that causes aids a year and a half ago , few people even dreamed that the citizens of poor nations would be able to get the antiretroviral drugs that have turned aids into a manageable disease in rich countries now , each week brings new developments on fighting aids in poor nations , and a stronger international consensus that poor countries can provide treatment to those infected and improve their prevention campaigns to slow the spread of the virus none of this will be possible , however , without leadership from the bush administration , which must take a more aggressive role in combatting aids abroad than its predecessor one reason for the worldwide movement on aids is that the dimensions of the apocalypse are beginning to sink in the aids virus is a plague that now afflicts one in five adults in south africa throughout africa , it is eroding economic growth and killing the most productive people it could bring about the social collapse of many countries , creating instability and humanitarian crises bush administration officials recognize that aids has become a foreign policy issue for the united states secretary of state colin powell has called aids an economic and national security problem and said congress has been generous but congress s allocation amounts to only 315 million this year for all aids programs worldwide vastly inadequate to prevent the catastrophic scenarios looming in africa an effective prevention program throughout africa the very minimum necessary would cost 15 billion , according to the united nations program on aids relieving the pain of aids sufferers and treating their infections would cost a similar amount , and providing drugs to attack the aids virus would cost even more the cipla offer has greatly increased the possibility that poor nations will be able to treat aids , especially if it provokes brandname drug makers to lower their prices , as it seems to be doing a year of therapy costs 10 , 000 or more in the united states , but several multinational drug companies have negotiated far lower prices with some african countries , as low as 1 , 000 a year , and now cipla will sell generic drug cocktails for less but even at 600 a year , these drugs are out of reach for most africans wealthy nations are going to have to pay for the drugs which could initially cost 3 billion a year for africa , and more as a greater number of patients are reached the west must help african nations improve their health care delivery systems so they can properly administer these drugs an effort that would reap many other health benefits as well america need not take on this financial burden alone , but it must assume part of the responsibility that will require the bush administration to multiply its allocation for aids in the third world substantially just as important , the administration must abandon its predecessors' policies that blocked access to cheap drugs in poor countries in the name of protecting the patent rights of american drug companies the pharmaceutical industry , whose donations favor republicans , is likely to be even more influential with this president than it was with bill clinton but the first sign from the bush administration is encouraging trade officials indicated last week that washington will not use trade to pressure poor nations that seek to make or buy generic aids drugs , as long as their efforts fall within world trade rules the clinton administration had used such tactics but abandoned them after criticism from aids activists many feared they would now be revived the bush administration should also work with unaids and the world health organization to improve access to needed medicines the means now exist to treat the sick , if america will help

tokyo , april 2 for all that has been written , broadcast and said about a banking crisis in japan , attention here has shifted from the banks to their borrowers bankruptcies are mounting while corporate earnings , exports and asset values are falling , all of which constrain the ability of japanese companies to repay their debts yoshimi watanabe , a member of parliament who advocates a die one time to be resurrected plan for japanese business , figures that in the last 10 years , asset value equivalent to two years of total japanese output more than 8 trillion has been lost the impact of this is huge on the balance sheets of japanese companies , and it s increasing , he said it s increasing the way cancer cells increase , and like cancer it has moved to another part of the body , the banks but make no mistake , its roots are in corporate japan the problems of japan s companies and those of its banks are indeed intertwined the banks have lent 353 trillion yen , or 279 trillion at current exchange rates , to japanese companies , according to data from the nation s central bank they have extended a further 84 trillion yen , or 66 billion , to local governments , most of which are effectively bankrupt of course , not all those loans are troubled , but the number of bad loans is increasing and many are collateralized by assets whose values are now shrinking research by david atkinson , a banking analyst at goldman sachs japan , found that 85 percent of problem loans are in the construction , retail , real estate and financial services sectors , which accounted for 62 percent of japanese companies and 561 percent of all domestic loans , as of last september at current earnings levels , mr atkinson estimates that it would take those businesses 150 years to repay their loans the government is considering giving companies 10 years to deal with their debts but mr atkinson wrote in a research report , there is not a single sector that could repay within 20 years , let alone 10 consider the case of kumagai gumi , a politically wellconnected general contractor crippled by roughly one trillion yen , or 88 billion , in debt in december , kumagai s lenders , led by sumitomo bank , forgave 430 billion yen of that debt in exchange for a sweeping restructuring plan that calls for a 30 percent reduction in the work force over three years , the sale of assets and the closing of 14 of 17 foreign offices the plan envisions a kumagai gumi 12 years from now with debt reduced to 242 billion yen time is hardly the contractor s only hurdle it is counting on 220 billion yen from asset sales , but prices are falling fast it also plans to use 150 billion yen of profits to achieve its goals , but the lucrative public works projects that kept many a japanese construction company going are petering out and profit margins in privatesector construction are razorthin perhaps the biggest problem with the plan is its underlying commitment to keeping kumagai gumi alive 12 years from now mr atkinson argues that of the companies in five highrisk industries , only onethird are needed to meet demand for their services that is what scares japanese policy makers trying to come up with a solution hakuo yanagisawa , the minister for financial services , has been watering down his plans for simultaneous overhauls of the corporate and financial sectors since he introduced them in january because the prospect of surging unemployment , falling wages and the forced sale of assets was too intimidating for his political colleagues to contemplate mr yanagisawa , initially insistent on writeoffs that would plunge deadbeat companies into bankruptcy , is now talking about encouraging consolidation , kumagaistyle debt forgiveness and ensuring that small and midsize businesses , a pillar of support for the governing liberal democratic party , do not suffer too much mr yanagisawa declined an interview request , but no one has any illusions about the pain that a thorough corporate overhaul would entail if you 're talking about really writing off bad debt , then you 're talking about foreclosing on the bad debtors , about bankrupting a lot of companies , said richard katz , author of japan the system that soured and senior editor of the oriental economist , a newsletter behind every bad debt stands a bad debtor that has built up car factories and office buildings and shopping malls and has used up real resources in the economy for things that are now essentially worthless mr katz estimates that a thorough cleanup of the japanese corporate sector , and thus the financial system , would mean the loss of two million to three million jobs and put further strains on public spending this is not palatable to the liberal democrats as they move toward a steep uphill battle in july s elections for the upper house of parliament the finance and labor ministries are both opposed to extending unemployment benefits and mr yanagisawa insists that there is no need to bail out the banks a stance that might seem indefensible until one considers that japanese taxpayers are already angry that a public bailout of the banking system two years ago failed to solve the problem
last sunday s new york times magazine published its annual review of people who died last year who left a particular mark on the world i am sure all readers have their own such list i certainly do indeed , someone who made the most important difference in my life died last year my high school journalism teacher , hattie m steinberg i grew up in a small suburb of minneapolis , and hattie was the legendary journalism teacher at st louis park high school , room 313 i took her intro to journalism course in 10th grade , back in 1969 , and have never needed , or taken , another course in journalism since she was that good hattie was a woman who believed that the secret for success in life was getting the fundamentals right and boy , she pounded the fundamentals of journalism into her students not simply how to write a lead or accurately transcribe a quote , but , more important , how to comport yourself in a professional way and to always do quality work to this day , when i forget to wear a tie on assignment , i think of hattie scolding me i once interviewed an ad exec for our high school paper who used a fourletter word we debated whether to run it hattie ruled yes that ad man almost lost his job when it appeared she wanted to teach us about consequences hattie was the toughest teacher i ever had after you took her journalism course in 10th grade , you tried out for the paper , the echo , which she supervised competition was fierce in 11th grade , i did n't quite come up to her writing standards , so she made me business manager , selling ads to the local pizza parlors that year , though , she let me write one story it was about an israeli general who had been a hero in the sixday war , who was giving a lecture at the university of minnesota i covered his lecture and interviewed him briefly his name was ariel sharon first story i ever got published those of us on the paper , and the yearbook that she also supervised , lived in hattie s classroom we hung out there before and after school now , you have to understand , hattie was a single woman , nearing 60 at the time , and this was the 1960 s she was the polar opposite of cool , but we hung around her classroom like it was a malt shop and she was wolfman jack none of us could have articulated it then , but it was because we enjoyed being harangued by her , disciplined by her and taught by her she was a woman of clarity in an age of uncertainty we remained friends for 30 years , and she followed , bragged about and critiqued every twist in my career after she died , her friends sent me a pile of my stories that she had saved over the years indeed , her students were her family only closer judy harrington , one of hattie s former students , remarked about other friends who were on hattie s newspapers and yearbooks we all graduated 41 years ago and yet nearly each day in our lives something comes up some mental image , some admonition that makes us think of hattie judy also told the story of one of hattie s last birthday parties , when one man said he had to leave early to take his daughter somewhere sit down , said hattie you 're not leaving yet she can just be a little late that was my teacher ! i sit up straight just thinkin' about her among the fundamentals hattie introduced me to was the new york times every morning it was delivered to room 313 i had never seen it before then real journalists , she taught us , start their day by reading the times and columnists like anthony lewis and james reston i have been thinking about hattie a lot this year , not just because she died on july 31 , but because the lessons she imparted seem so relevant now we 've just gone through this huge dotcominternetglobalization bubble during which a lot of smart people got carried away and forgot the fundamentals of how you build a profitable company , a lasting portfolio , a nation state or a thriving student it turns out that the real secret of success in the information age is what it always was fundamentals reading , writing and arithmetic , church , synagogue and mosque , the rule of law and good governance the internet can make you smarter , but it ca n't make you smart it can extend your reach , but it will never tell you what to say at a pta meeting these fundamentals cannot be downloaded you can only upload them , the oldfashioned way , one by one , in places like room 313 at st louis park high i only regret that i did n't write this column when the woman who taught me all that was still alive
washington , nov 26 president bush , joined by a chorus of religious and political leaders in the united states and abroad , today condemned the work of a massachusetts biotechnology company that says it has created human embryos through cloning the white house called on lawmakers to ban the practice the use of embryos to clone is wrong , mr bush said this morning at a rose garden ceremony to welcome two christian relief workers who were rescued from afghanistan we should not as a society grow life to destroy it the president s comments , coming on the heels of the company s announcement on sunday , reignite an intense debate that had been all but extinguished by the sept 11 attacks the senate is facing increased pressure to consider legislation , similar to a bill passed by the house of representatives in july , that would prohibit human cloning either for reproduction or to create tissue for treating disease hours after mr bush spoke , senator sam brownback , republican of kansas , said he would push the senate to adopt the bill before its christmas recess if lawmakers refuse to do so , mr brownback said , he will press for a sixmonth moratorium that would temporarily ban the cloning research you have a president who wants to sign this , mr brownback said at a packed news conference , flanked by cloning opponents from across the political spectrum you have a house of representatives that is very interested in getting this through and now you have an announcement of a human clone at this point , however , no clone exists , because all the embryos that were created in the massachusetts experiment died before they even grew to eight cells the research announced on sunday was conducted by advanced cell technology , a company in worcester , mass , that wants to use cloning technology to create stem cells the specialized cells could be used to grow tissues that would be a perfect match for patients as treatments for diseases like diabetes the company says it does not want to clone human beings but its work , often called therapeutic cloning , is controversial because the embryos are created expressly for science , and would be destroyed when the stem cells are extracted opponents argue that the research will inevitably lead to human cloning we are on the verge of having human embryo farms in laboratories all across america , representative christopher h smith , republican of new jersey , said today he called the experiments ghoulish work the cloning issue has also become intertwined with another , related subject , that of embryonic stem cell research on aug 9 , mr bush announced that the federal government would pay for certain stem cell experiments , and said he would create a new bioethics panel , headed by dr leon kass of the university of chicago , to advise him on the research in light of advanced cell technology s announcement , white house officials said today that the president would issue an executive order establishing the commission by the end of this week but the members of the panel will not be named until the end of the year , the officials said unlike the stem cell studies , none of the research involving therapeutic cloning is paid for by the government the experiments are conducted entirely in the private sector , mostly out of the view of regulators and the public by contrast , the government of britain expressly permits , and regulates , therapeutic cloning experiments but other countries expressed opposition to the research today in germany , where memories of the nazi experiments still touch a raw nerve , the president of the association of german doctors said the advanced cell technology research was unethical and officials at the european commission said they would not finance any similar projects not everything scientifically possible and technologically feasible is necessarily desirable , philippe busquin , the european research commissioner , said in a statement in the united states , the cloning issue brings together a diverse coalition of foes , including environmentalists , women s rights advocates , conservative christians and abortion opponents representatives from more than a dozen such groups attended mr brownback s news conference today , and both they and he warned that the senate could not afford to leave washington without passing at least a moratorium on therapeutic cloning but prospects for the legislation , and the moratorium , are unclear a spokesman for senator tom daschle , the democratic leader , said today that mr daschle intended to schedule a vote on the cloning ban next year , as originally planned at the same time , senator arlen specter , the pennsylvania republican who is mr brownback s chief opponent on matters concerning stem cell research , vowed to fight any attempt at a moratorium , or a quick vote on the cloning bill i'm prepared to go to the mat on it , said mr specter , adding that he has scheduled several hearings on the issue for early next year the scientific community is ready to put forward a very strong case , mr specter said , and i think that case will be persuasive to the congress
it s a thin line between moviemaking and the reality of a brooklyn summer in jim mckay s comingofage film our song , which chronicles the lives of three teenage girls whose urban refuge is a highstepping band when the 60 members of the jackie robinson steppers strut into view to the staccato beat of tenor drums , the youths in black and gold plumes really are the children of crown heights the apartments in the brick towers of the albany housing center , which serve as a backdrop , are theirs their hangout tony s pizza appears , and so does the band s stern but affectionate leader , tyrone brown , whose mantra is heads up heads together tie your shoes even the movie s plot lines , which in some cases seem too dramatic or tragic eerily parallel the real lives of band members and actors in an hour and a half , the movie shows what we do every day , said mr brown , 23 , who started in the band as a sousaphone player at 13 it s definitely a reality so when people ask me , 'were n't some of those stories too much to put in the movie \? ' i say no , it s not our song , which opens wednesday at film forum , was written and directed by mr mckay , 39 , a selfeffacing independent filmmaker who first saw the band in a brooklyn day parade ultimately , he spent a year simply observing the band and gathering material for his script the result is a movie with the grit of a steamy day language and all in crown heights , a neighborhood surrounded by park slope , bedfordstuyvesant , east flatbush and prospect park crown heights is home to three distinct groups africanamericans , hasidic jews and blacks from haiti and jamaica mr mckay , who is white , trained his cameras on the slice of the neighborhood that is africanamerican our song tells three stories of girls whose adolescence seems far too fleeting they shop and compare boyfriends one wonders if she should continue her pregancy they mourn the death of a young mother who commits suicide by jumping out a window with her toddler in her arms mr mckay said that he decided to make a movie about girls because comingofage stories about young men have become too familiar when i go to the movies i want to see something different , and when i make movies i want to make something different , said mr mckay , who as the son of two schoolteachers was raised in a largely white middleclass new jersey suburb and played drums in the marching band at hackensack high school for a lot of art movie viewers , 'our song' is like a foreign film you spend an hour and a half in a place and with people who you really are n't necessarily acquainted with and i'm making a generalization about the art house audience that is unfortunately true , which is that it is mostly middle , uppermiddleclass white his quest was to maintain realism i'm trying to create this feeling of submerging yourself into someone else s life for an hour and half , he said to create that documentary mood , he used nonprofessionals in more than a third of the roles some members of the jackie robinson steppers were given small speaking parts mr mckay had to work around the routines of his actors' lives for example , he replaced one musician in a small role after the player took a job at mcdonald s , where his schedule did n't fit in with filmmaking mr mckay said he held casting calls that drew more than 400 people , some of whom had seen fliers posted in local high schools when we were trying to get money for the movie early on , we talked about , should we try and get some young rapper \? he said maybe that would bring in the money but i did n't want to pierce reality it was really hard for me to make it real , which is hard when you cast for young people the movie s three lead actresses kerry washington , anna simpson and melissa martinez were all new york natives who commuted to crown heights for filming from their homes in spanish harlem , the bronx and the rockaways their subway commutes doubled as rehearsal time none of the three had ever acted in a feature film anna simpson , 16 when filming started in the summer of 1999 , was living out one of the movie s plot lines the filmmakers interviewed her when she was five months' pregnant , and she had her baby shortly before filming started the three actresses enrolled in the steppers under their characters' names to get a feeling for the insular dynamics of the band , which was formed in 1989 and developed into a new york institution with prolific appearances at events like the turkish day parade and breakfast serenades at gracie mansion the members range from 8 to 18 and rehearse four days a week , receiving afterschool tutoring as well i almost forgot we were doing a film , said melissa martinez , who admitted that she felt somewhat fearful when she enrolled in the band as her character , maria it became my reality , being in the band when they talked about getting pushups if you talked in line , i was afraid i loved dancing and playing the tenor drum i would n't mind doing another drum thing it was so cool , and we knew we were good to a certain extent , the movie s budget dictated the need for realism in the early stages , a small group of people were able to raise about 110 , 000 with credit cards and investments of 10 , 000 to 20 , 000 later the budget grew to 400 , 000 the 15person crew had to indulge in guerrilla filmmaking during the 20day shoot in july 1999 for example , the filmmakers could n't afford permits to shoot on the a train , which was the setting for one scene so they set up cameras on the train , and everyone watched for signs of the police i was on the subway that day , and with the rest of the crew i was on the lookout for police officers , ms washington said if we saw one , our plan was to just turn off the cameras and act like nothing was going on it makes me laugh , because i learned to do guerrilla filmmaking with jim and now i'm in this big movie where they bought the path train for the night because there s a scene where chris rock and i are having a conversation tyrone brown , the bandleader , said the filmmakers probably were n't aware of all the ways in which the movie directly mirrored life a drum major with a speaking role became pregnant six months after filming finished the suicide scene was an echo of an earlier band drama the brother of one player , he said , was pushed out a window by his mother the band went to the funeral in uniform , mr brown said things happen because of the stress that goes here with the poverty people think there s no answer , no other way out but mr brown is counting on the movie to help raise expectations and the profile of the steppers since the movie s debut at the new directors new films festival in april 2000 , mr brown said membership has almost doubled he s hoping that new exposure of the film will lead to more parade invitations , perhaps university scholarships for graduating players and the chance to perform for an expanding audience that , mr brown said , is something to live for photo kerry washington , left , anna simpson and melissa martinez play friends and fellow marchingband members in our song \( paul mezey ifc films \)
'reflections of opulence' nassau county museum of art , 1 museum drive , roslyn harbor through aug 5 \( 516 \) 4849337 the two french design movements that dominated european and american decorative arts from the late 19th century to world war ii are the subject of this kaleidoscopic show , which aims to trace the art nouveau and art deco sensibilities in the fine and applied arts the focus is on high style that is to say , objects made for wealthy customers by top designers and craftsmen and on painters and sculptors whose aesthetic concerns parallel or complement those of the decorative arts if only the show itself were as straightforward and clearly laid out as the catalog , which outlines and illustrates the two movements' characteristics , showing what they have in common and what is unique to each the actual display , on the other hand , is a crowded m lange that mixes art nouveau and art deco seemingly at random with a few notable exceptions , the galleries follow no chronological , stylistic or thematic plan the first room , however , is a unified survey of art nouveau , from intricate inlaid cabinet work by majorelle and benouville to gall glass , tiffany lamps and pierre bonnard s lithographed room screen , strongly influenced by japanese prints but from here on , the installation is more or less a jumble with so much territory to cover , the show would have benefited greatly from an organizing principle the advantages of such an approach are evident in the wonderful room of chairs , in which the biomorphic forms of guimard and horta can be compared with the machineage functionalism of hoffmann , gray and breuer similar groupings of tableware , jewelry , glass and other categories would have helped make sense of the material , just as the first gallery effectively summarizes the art nouveau aesthetic 'carl van vechten' heckscher museum of art , 2 prime avenue , huntington through aug 26 \( 631 \) 3513250 as a music , theater and dance critic whose career began during the jazz age , carl van vechten was instrumental in promoting mainstream acceptance of africanamerican artists and writers his taste was catholic , encompassing everything from music hall entertainment to poetry and philosophy , and he was often as interested in the artists themselves as in their work today , if van vechten is known at all , it is for his photographic portraits of his creative and intellectual black friends among the socalled talented tenth who populated the harlem renaissance in the 1920 s and 30 s the current show features a crosssection of his images , with a few from the 1940 s to illustrate his continuing fascination with africanamerican culture as a white man , van vechten was often accused of patronizing or exploiting his subjects , but the charges are refuted by the sensitivity of his portrayals each individual is treated with evident respect , and each plays a carefully defined role , whether theatrical , as in avon long s portrayal of sportin' life from porgy and bess , or the selfdefined guises of cab calloway , showing off his trademark mop of hair , and bessie smith , whose bluesinflected portrait was among van vechten s own favorites apart from an outdoor shot of the poet countee cullen , the pictures are obviously staged , or more to the point , they are designed to amplify qualities important to both the photographer and the sitter 'abstract expressionism' emily lowe gallery , hofstra museum , 112 hofstra university , hempstead through aug 2 \( 516 \) 4635672 as the show s guest curator , grace renzikantuser , suggests in her catalog introduction that abstract expressionism is more a state of mind than a definitive painting style whether such an approach is still relevant more than half a century after its inception can be judged by the examples on view miss renzikantuser and nine of her contemporaries are each showing one work from the 1950 s and one recent painting as convincing evidence that the movement remains valid with no knowledge of what happened between those extremes , one might assume that the artists were unnaturally faithful to abstract expressionism that is true for some , but the fact that others have returned to it , as if coming full circle , makes it seem all the more compelling accumulated experience has directed buffie johnson away from gestural exuberance toward formal austerity , although textured brushwork continues to play a strong role in her surfaces vibrant color is the primary concern for aurora diasjorgensen , whose career was interrupted and later resumed with remarkable consistency william quinn and fred mitchell have remained devoted to the aesthetics of the new york school , although mr quinn transplanted it to his native st louis , where it evidently flourished comparing his rough , angular 1953 collage painting to a recent oil , one can see refinement that sacrifices none of the earlier energy the softly modulated tonality of mr mitchell s 1996 circular canvas , a day on earth , is echoed in torso , his 1955 oil , and both works use translucence and staining to make pigment seem to melt and fuse , as if in flux implicit movement is a recurring tactic , one that gives abstract expressionism its aura of energy from the staccato slashes in miss renzikantuser s traces to the massive torque of the late richards ruben s turnabout , dynamic forces are manifested in abstract imagery photos mahogany goose cabinet , about 1900 , by louis majorelle , is part of an exhibition at the nassau county museum of

what s playing at the roxy \? nothing , of course not since 1960 , when demolition crews ravaged the cathedral of the motion picture at seventh avenue and 50th street in manhattan and all but declared open season on movie palaces since then new york city has lost many of its monumental cinemas but it has not lost them all some of the most eyepopping , jawdropping fantasy factories of the early 20th century survive at surprising intersections and in unexpected ways they are as capable of inspiring a giddy sense of awe today as they were when their silver screens flickered and most can be visited by the public do n't expect popcorn , however none are movie theaters any longer while radio city music hall and the beacon theater at broadway and 74th street are still used for performances , most of the rest have been transformed from pleasure domes to spiritual oases new york s first deluxe movie house , the 88yearold regent theater at 116th street and adam clayton powell jr boulevard in harlem , has long been the first corinthian baptist church churches also occupy two loew s wonder theaters the 175th street theater , at broadway , in washington heights , and the landmark valencia , at jamaica avenue and merrick boulevard in jamaica , queens which have few rivals for sheer overthetop exuberance a spanish patio garden in gay regalia for a moonlit festival , as early publicity releases described it , the valencia was an atmospheric theater , designed by john eberson , in which 3 , 500 moviegoers at a time found themselves seated under a blue night sky filled with twinkling stars and drifting clouds rising to the sky was a spanish village , or rather a spanish village as envisioned by an austrianborn architect working in the baroque churrigueresque style from an office in chicago to satisfy hollywood tastes around the auditorium a halfdozen diminutive structures a gazebo here , a loggia there were arrayed in cascading tiers as if set on a hillside that was the payoff , but the experience of the valencia began in the gleaming lobby , where moviegoers lined up between a long colonnade and a row of scalloped balconies from there it was into the twostory grand foyer , with a vaulted ceiling and a fish pond with tinkling fountain the valencia opened in 1929 but did not even make its golden anniversary in 1977 loew s donated the building to the tabernacle of prayer for all people , a congregation from the east new york section of brooklyn apostle johnnie washington , the founding pastor of the tabernacle , called the gift a miracle at a time when miracles are not supposed to happen it has a beauty , an atmosphere that makes you feel you are at some place sacred , he said at the time a riot of turquoise , ruby , cobalt and gold , the valencia has lost almost none of its romance , except perhaps in the lighted coves above the proscenium arch , where nude goddesses have been given robes and wings to make it more holy , they became angels , explained elder jeffrey c williams sr , the administrator of the tabernacle he fell under the valencia s spell as a boy when he and his brother came to see the movie amazing grace , with moms mabley , he said it took several minutes for young jeffrey to convince himself that he was seated indoors today a few stars still twinkle faintly in the ceiling cypress trees along the balcony edge almost seem to sway in an evening breeze \( although their plasterlike verdure crumbles to the touch \) and a hanging lantern in the veranda far up the hillside still waits to cast its golden glow on some beguiling se orita or se or in the window the tabernacle has added a 400bulb chandelier and a wall of crutches in the grand foyer from those who are said to have been healed at the church and it keeps the theater burnished mr williams constantly finds iconographic features that convince him the valencia was destined to become a religious sanctuary they shall mount up with wings as eagles , said the prophet isaiah and there are eagles the book of revelation speaks of jesus as the lion of the tribe of judah and there are lions lots of lions as he climbed the stairs to the balcony the other day , mr williams spotted some leonine ceiling brackets these lions i 've never noticed before , and i 've been part of this ministry 22 years , he said there are lions and eagles at loew s 175th street theater but buddhas , bodhisattvas and elephants were also added to the mix at this oriental palace of jewels a delirious masterpiece by the architectural impresario thomas w lamb , this gilded 3 , 600seat theater chased away depression blues with a d cor that borrowed from the alhambra in spain , the kailasa rockcut shrine of india and the wat phra keo temple in thailand even its exterior is a feast under a deep entablature and blind colonnade are honeycombs of stalactite stonework in an islamic pattern known as muqarnas exotic ornaments , colors and scenes are particularly effective in creating an atmosphere in which the mind is free to frolic and becomes receptive to entertainment , lamb wrote
los angeles , nov 20 if shrek wins the newly created oscar for best animated feature film in march , the sole person who will stride to the stage to pick it up will be aron warner , who runs pacific data images , dreamworks s computer animation division why this is a hot piece of hollywood news and not merely an item of interest to computer animators and mr warner s family illustrates the intense speculation and behindthescenes maneuvering in what is becoming the most fiercely contested category in the forthcoming 74th academy awards the battle is expected to pit disney , which has released monsters , inc for its partner pixar animation , against dreamworks for shrek it s reasonable to assume that if you 're making odds , you 're not going to make much money if you bet against shrek' and 'monsters , inc' being nominated , said thomas schumacher , president of walt disney animation after that it s anybody s bet jeffrey katzenberg , who founded dreamworks with steven spielberg and david geffen , and who has led the creation of its animation division , was one of the producers of shrek and could have easily designated himself to collect the award many in hollywood savored the possibility , looking forward to the inevitable controversy over having such a powerful studio executive on the ballot you may remember that before dreamworks , mr katzenberg had been running walt disney studios during the renaissance of its animation division in the 1980 s and 90 s but he had a very public falling out with his former mentor michael eisner , chairman of disney , that ended in an ugly court case that the two were facing off in a new oscar category might have been drama enough add to that the disneydreamworks rivalry , and the hollywood gossip mills have been working overtime which brings us back to aron warner and why he alone would accept an oscar for shrek under the rules for this new category no more than two people can accept the award , and they must be the key creative talent most clearly responsible for the overall achievement if monsters , inc wins , for instance , those onstage are expected to be the film s director , peter docter , and pixar s creative director , john lasseter but for months people in the movie industry have been wondering who would pick up an oscar for shrek the film has two directors , andrew adamson and vicky jenson , leaving no room onstage for any of its producers and since one of those producers is none other than mr katzenberg , who by all accounts had a central role in making the film , would he insist on taking part personally in the triumph over his former employer \? for disney , the inclusion of mr katzenberg as a nominee might have proved a potent oscar campaign issue , especially in a year when the academy of motion picture arts and sciences is cracking down on the proliferation of producer credits , particularly for studio executives who are listed as producers without necessarily having had central roles in the filmmaking entries for the animated film feature had to be submitted to the academy by nov 1 , and the entry form had to state who would accept the award but the academy , as is its policy , did not make the names public , a silence that only accelerated the guessing game we had a meeting with the seven principal producers , the directors and all of the people who were essential in making the movie , mr katzenberg said we all agreed that the best way would be to have just one person go up there to represent the entire creative team we felt we should be represented by an individual , and the person who is most deserving of getting recognition and who has not yet gotten the recognition he deserves since the movie came out is aron warner none of this would be causing nearly as many waves if this had not been as is widely accepted in hollywood such a poor year for film quality at the box office , business is up , even in the wake of sept 11 , and 2001 looks as if it will be yet another record year , perhaps surpassing 8 billion at the north american box office for the first time but which films will fight for best picture \? a few possibilities ridley scott s black hawk down , ron howard s beautiful life , michael mann s ali , cameron crowe s vanilla sky and frank darabont s majestic are yet to hit theaters but of the films already released the pickings are slim some mention the independent hit memento others are fans of baz luhrmann s moulin rouge ! and some even think that shrek has a shot at the top award as well as the animated one but in a lackluster year speculation has naturally begun to swirl around the only category that seems to promise an interesting fight disney executives complained when dreamworks released shrek on video on nov 2 , the same friday that monsters , inc hit theaters , saying that the move seemed like an underhanded attempt to siphon off some of their film s steam \( videos are traditionally released on tuesdays \) dreamworks responded that it simply shifted the release to a friday to make it more of an event \( the video ended up making more than 100 million in its first weekend in stores \) and predicted that it and other studios would do so more frequently with important films
fernando ferrer speaking yesterday at the national action network in harlem there is a very interesting expectation in this election , that the policies of the last eight years must define the agenda for the next four if someone else believes that rudy giuliani is the personification of a new york resurgent , and all those policies are terrific and must continue , you need to vote for somebody else not me because i acknowledge what has not gone right somebody asked me about crime 'you want to see crime back \? ' oh , come on you 're going to give me a lecture on crime \? listen , i did n't grow up in a suburb of boston i grew up on fox street in the south bronx , when it was the south bronx mark green remarks made yesterday during the labor day parade no one stood up to rudy giuliani more over the past seven and a half years than i have after a decade of divisiveness , i'm now the democrat who is going to take on problems , not rivals , not their endorsers , not their surrogates , and i feel confident that i have enormous support in the black community and the latino community franklin roosevelt understood poverty better than newt gingrich our former president did n't grow up in poverty , and newt gingrich did whether or not you understand poverty is not your zip code or where you were brought up it s your courage to take on hard fights and win i do n't know anyone who s done more for communities of color in the last seven and a half years than i have peter f vallone remarks made during the labor day parade yesterday my whole political life has been underestimated they said i could n't do safe streets safe city when i cut a budget by 2 billion in one month , that s when i was underestimated i 've been underestimated and i'm certainly underestimated in these polls i 've been underestimated by a minimum of 20 points i'm concerned about people in new york city who vote , not pollsters the major thing that separates me from the other candidates is the fact that i have not only done things like safe streets safe city , campaign finance , reducing class size i do n't have to talk about it , i 've done those things and i think people are beginning to understand that alan g hevesi speaking yesterday in union square park i am the manager of the comptroller s office , and we are the managers we are the ones who audit all city agencies we did the y2k to make sure there was no trouble the city is the center of the global economy i am the representative , in effect , of the city in the global economy we do yen deals , we do trade deals with south africa , we do euro deals education is the no 1 issue i'm the educator i have a phd i 've been in the classroom for 27 years none of my opponents have been in the classroom and i 've been endorsed by the united federation of teachers you 've got to be a fiscal expert that s my official designation as the fiscal monitor and finally , you 've got to have the best relationship with the governor and the legislature , regardless of party , because they have to approve 75 or 80 percent of any initiative or innovation that we make i have the best relationship coming out of the legislature , as a member of the assembly for 22 years michael r bloomberg speaking at frank golden memorial park in college point , queens , and addressing a little league picnic my no 1 priority is education the city already spent 12 billion out of a 40billion budget and it looks like tax revenues are going to come down as the economy softens and also , everybody agrees , for example , that teachers need raises what rudy did for education was he brought crime down so dramatically that the next mayor has the luxury of focusing on education rudy eight years ago did not have that you know you could n't walk the streets today you can you might not like rudy whether you like rudy or not , crime is way down it can go further , so the next mayor really has an opportunity , and if they do n't focus on education it will be a terrible waste herman badillo remarks made yesterday at the labor day parade as the campaign winds down , we 're beginning to find the real character of mr bloomberg and that is that he is the kind of personality that cannot be trusted and should not be mayor of new york because of the remarks that he has made , but also because of his unwillingness to respond to the press we all know that if you 're not prepared to answer question after question after question ad infinitum from reporters , you 're certainly not qualified to be mayor my campaign is very simple i have credentials and he has commercials i have experience , he has no experience i have been scrutinized all my life in every way for the past 40 years he has never been held up to scrutiny and now we find out why because he cannot stand scrutiny and i'm going and saying to people that they should not elect a 30million commercial as mayor that they should elect a real person and they should , for that reason , elect herman badillo photos \( suzanne dechillo the new york times \)
baldwin as albany legislators armed with the latest census figures take up the onceadecade task of reconfiguring legislative districts , some civic groups are pursuing campaigns to unify communities split among multiple representatives and divided by district lines nowhere is the problem felt more acutely than in baldwin , a south shore hamlet that is a jigsaw puzzle of legislative districts baldwin s representation in the house of representatives is split between peter t king and carolyn mccarthy in the state senate between dean g skelos and charles j fuschillo jr in the state assembly among earlene hill , kathleen murray and robert barra and in the nassau county legislature among patrick williams , joseph scannell and michael zapson aside from the united states senate , the only legislative body in which baldwin is not split between districts is the hempstead town board , where anthony santino is the hamlet s only councilman with multiple lawmakers at almost all levels of government , residents say they are insufficiently represented by people whose focus is baldwin and its interests adapting arguments made in the lawsuit that turned hempstead s atlarge town council arrangement into a district system last year , they say the system amounts to a dilution of the voting power of baldwin s 32 , 000 residents if the community is dissatisfied with its representation , voters are free to exercise the power of the ballot box to either reward or punish that representative , said doris r duffy , a member of the baldwin community association and chairwoman of a committee on legislative redistricting but baldwin cannot reward or punish because we are so carved up our votes do not mean as much as an entire village or area that is completely represented by one legislator baldwin s problem was exemplified prior to a renovation of the hamlet s long island rail road station in 1999 late in the planning , community groups learned that the metropolitan transportation authority proposed to overhaul the station in a style clashing with plans for baldwin s downtown revitalization project , featuring antiquestyled lighting and benches the mta s plans were brought in line with the community s only after residents contacted the town s two state senators and three assembly members like 31 other places in the town of hempstead alone , baldwin is an unincorporated hamlet without a local government and that creates a hardship for residents , they say , since no one has governmental authority except councilman santino , whose district also includes a portion of hewlett , east rockaway , oceanside , lynbrook , rockville centre and island park the advantage of having one representative at the town level , mr santino said , is that you have one representative for the community and everyone knows who to go to mr scannell , who lives in baldwin but represents only part of the hamlet in the county legislature , suggested that all of baldwin be included in his district it s easier to advocate for a town , easier to go to bat when one person knows all the issues , mr scannell said incorporation is an option , but the nassau county charter bars newly incorporated villages from controlling their own zoning , a major function of most village governments ms duffy said redistricting is a more expedient and immediate way to effect change at all levels of government the baldwin community association has petitioned the state legislative task force on demographic research and reapportionment , a sixmember bipartisan panel charged with redrawing congressional , senate and assembly districts , to to reduce the number of lawmakers representing baldwin at each legislative level the panel is scheduled to issue its plan this month , but the decision ultimately rests with state lawmakers once a plan receives clearance from the federal justice department , it must then be approved by the governor nassau and suffolk will also redraw their legislative districts next year baldwin is not the only community on the island balking about being divided by district lines a coalition of groups representing africanamericans in new cassel , east garden city , hempstead , uniondale , roosevelt , freeport , lakeview and elmont , along with wyandanch and north amityville in suffolk , say split senatorial districts have weakened blacks' voting power dorothy l goosby , a plaintiff in the suit that abolished atlarge districts in the town of hempstead and now a member of the town board , contends that for three decades , state lawmakers have repeatedly gerrymandered minority communities to thin the percentages of blacks in many state senate districts after the 1990 census , she said , legislators split minority communities such as freeport , roosevelt , hempstead , uniondale , west hempstead , south hempstead and north baldwin between the sixth and eighth state senate districts and westbury , new cassel , elmont , south floral park and north valley stream between the seventh and the ninth senate districts she suggested that minority communities in the sixth through ninth senate districts , which are geographically compact and contiguous , could constitute a majority in a redrawn district
astana , kazakhstan , sept 23 at an outdoor mass attended mostly by muslims , pope john paul ii spoke out today against an overzealous military response to terrorist attacks on the united states and said a religious war was a contradiction in terms in remarks that seemed to speak to both the united states and islamic militants , he said that we must not let what has happened lead to a deepening of divisions between muslims and christians , adding , religion must never be used as a reason for conflict though obviously under great physical strain , the 81yearold pope , who suffers from parkinson s disease , was forceful in his remarks to the crowd in motherland square here , which ended , with all my heart , i beg god to keep the world in peace after reading president bush s speech to congress on the sept 11 terrorist attacks several times , the pope decided on saturday night that he had to speak out more directly on the international situation and to say something beyond the text already prepared for his homily at today s mass , said his spokesman , joaqu n navarrovalls yesterday in the plane , we exchanged views , dr navarrovalls said of the discussion of mr bush s speech last night , he said he would say something more , and he wrote it dr navarrovalls suggested that the pope believed that the extremists directly responsible for the attacks on the united states could and should be distinguished from the wider threat of islamic fundamentalism and that any response should be limited to punishing the guilty the pope s spokesman chose not to answer questions about what the pope thought of mr bush s speech instead , dr navarrovalls said that he s concerned and asking for more information on the topic of refugees in the whole area at a time when central asia is expecting the united states to strike nearby afghanistan , the pope insisted on coming here this week , in part to highlight kazakhstan s recent record of religious tolerance this multiethnic country has large numbers of muslims and orthodox christians and a smaller population of roman catholics certainly there is a risk , and everyone sees it , dr navarrovalls said it s clear there are fears in kazakhstan about the situation but he added the pope is here to stress that the present situation cannot be interpreted as a conflict between islam and christians or between islam and the western world this would be dangerous and does not reflect reality the pope is trying to stress that muslims and christians can live together , work together and pray together as is happening now in kazakhstan the pope , who opposed the war in the persian gulf when mr bush s father was president , said today , i wish to make an earnest call to everyone , christians and the followers of other religions , that we work together to build a world without violence , a world that loves life and grows in justice and solidarity pressed to define what justice the pope thinks should come to terrorists , dr navarrovalls demurred , saying , justice is justice asked if that meant the pope felt that they should be held accountable , he said , yes those who are guilty of these acts both muslims and christians in the crowd of 25 , 000 about threequarters muslim , according to official estimates said there was no real tension here between different brands of believers in this former soviet republic , all of whom suffered under stalin and throughout the soviet era they have been through a lot together a roman catholic nun from slovakia , sister magdalena sumilasova , who is a missionary here , said , i 've heard people who were deported here in stalinist times say the kazakh people helped us , gave us bread and a roof , and kept us from dying of hunger even she , who is actively pursuing converts , said tensions between religious groups remained relatively low some orthodox priests have a positive attitude toward us , and some consider us a sect but the people do n't see a big difference , she said her church also has good relations with local muslim groups , she said because of tight security for the mass today , the square here was surrounded by multiple rings of soldiers those entering the square had to walk through a metal detector , and their bags were searched the pope offered the mass , which lasted more than two hours , at an altar under a turquoise

prague , april 16 nearly a decade ago , as emerging democracies in central and eastern europe shifted business and industry to private hands , stock markets began to sprout across the region now , a dearth of issues , stagnant trading volumes and investor apathy have analysts and traders warning that unless these markets combine and grow , they will have no future since foreign investors have bought out the most promising listed companies and bankruptcies have scuttled a rash of others , only half a dozen actively traded stocks remain in most markets small investors and local institutions prefer the safety and returns of bonds and foreign equities companies find it easier and cheaper to raise capital from private equity investment , bank loans and bonds foreign investors interested in regional stocks favor buying them through american or global depository receipts listed in london , new york or frankfurt , where there is more liquidity traders say many regional markets are too opaque for their clients and the costs of maintaining offices are too high for the low returns the only market vibrant enough to exist independently in a shakeout is warsaw s , because poland s mandatory private pension funds have become major investors in local stocks , analysts say the demands of liquidity , transparency and low transaction costs mean it is clear there will be fewer national markets in the future , said willem h buiter , chief economist of the european bank for reconstruction and development additionally , although economies may be growing across the region , the markets have been battered by fallout from the slump in the united states and the flight of investors from emerging markets prague s main index is down more than 30 percent the last year , and budapest has fallen around 28 percent even warsaw has slid , around 27 percent trading volumes have also collapsed prague and budapest , the region s largest markets after warsaw , are the markets whose futures many economists are most concerned about prague opened in 1993 , with 200 stocks figuring in its main index now , the chief index lists 50 shares , but only about 6 are actively traded the lack of turnover has prompted dozens of local brokers to close up shop the last three years , including the dutch investment bank abn amro , which shut down its prague stocktrading arm in january the prague bourse must change if it is to survive , said miroslav nosal , a czech equities analyst at merrill lynch in london i do not believe that it has a very longterm future in its current shape , he said in budapest , analysts say , the market is permanently bearish they blame complex listing regulations and the government s decision to privatize large companies in the hands of strategic investors rather than float them on the bourse you have to have investors to buy the stocks , and stocks for the investors to buy , said frances cloud , senior east european analyst at nomura international in london if that does n't happen , i can see the hungarian market becoming more of a backwater until it decides to merge with another regional market and throw in the towel bourses in smaller countries , like slovakia , croatia and yugoslavia , may have only one or two issues that attract real interest , and across the region , excluding russia , there have been fewer than 100 initial public offerings , analysts say most stocks are former state companies transferred to the market for privatization the exchanges mirror the problems of the companies in these small countries , said dominic hughes at commerzbank securities in london none has the critical mass to attract significant flows of international capital over the years , prague , budapest and other exchanges have discussed many plans to merge or coordinate with one another , to link up with big exchanges like london or frankfurt , or to form a regional superexchange but much like bourse merger talks in western europe , they have mostly gone nowhere estonia s tiny tallinn bourse moved last week to shore up its future by selling the exchange to the helsinki exchanges group , which owns the helsinki bourse , with volume 198 times that of tallinn the sale makes trading in the 30odd listed estonian stocks just one click away for traders on helsinki s vibrant stock exchange , and tallinn is already harmonizing settlement and disclosure rules with helsinki other exchanges are taking smaller steps , for now prague s directors said last month that they wanted to revive plans for a derivatives market the budapest bourse s chief executive , who laid off a third of her staff and cut costs last year , said her bourse would survive by attracting companies too small to be floated abroad still , analysts say , it will be tough to draw the large foreign institutional investors whose money is so vital all my investment universe has gdr s and adr s , said urs antonioli , who manages 300 million in eastern europe for ubs asset management in zurich i do n't need a third or fourth exchange i need one exchange that offers me sufficient liquidity chart diverging fates trading on stock exchanges

before it was the big apple , new york was the big oyster , at a time american oysters were known for their size a dubious endorsement came from the english novelist william makepeace thackeray , who wrote that eating an american oyster was like eating a baby new york was for several centuries one of the world s oyster centers new york oysters were said to be less perishable , oysters that knew how to take it in the 19th century , when europe and america were in the throes of an oyster craze , more oysters were shipped abroad from new york than from any other american port in 1626 , when peter minuit made the first new york real estate killing , buying manhattan for a reputed 24 , he had the clearheadedness also to buy the oyster grounds , oyster island \( it was renamed ellis island in 1770 \) by 1664 , when the british took manhattan , oystering was an important new york industry and soon came under regulation a 1679 ordinance restricted to 10 the number of oyster boats in the great south bay of long island despite such regulations , many prominent new york oyster beds , including those of staten island , were stripped in the 18th and early 19th century but new york is a city where rapacious shortsightedness has always been the mother of invention after destroying the oyster beds , 19thcentury new yorkers were among the pioneers in the cultivation of oysters it was discovered that oysters in the larval stage , often taken from connecticut or the chesapeake , deposited in suitable beds , would attach a foot and grow new york oysters , like so much in new york , were not really bigger , just better marketed as with many marine species , warmer waters promote growth according to john kochiss , in oystering from new york to boston , it takes a long island oyster four to five years to grow to the same marketable size that a gulf of mexico oyster reaches in only two years different new york oysters had their turn as stars , and in 1827 it was the saddle rock s moment these enormous oysters were found at the base of a 20foothigh rock in the east river and became so popular that within 10 years there were none left the most famous new york oyster , the blue point , is not large its name is derived not from appearance but from its town of origin on long island the diminutive blue point was celebrated for its white flesh and round shape , and by the mid19th century all of the great south bay produced blue points the british imported many blue points as well as east rivers and staten island sounds other new york oysters enjoyed international reputations some were near nyack , others by city island , still others from jamaica bay , like rockaways and jamaicans there were even , until the early 20th century , a number of manhattan oysters flushing bay , by what is now la guardia airport , was a major oyster area in the first half of the 19th century , oyster wagons with fresh horses and ice carried new york oysters deep into the continent new yorkstyle oyster bars were featured in most midwestern cities abraham lincoln , campaigning in illinois , gave oyster parties oyster wagons and ice stations were not new the romans had transported brittany oysters to rome the same way but in the 1840 s , the railroads brought transport of perishable food into a new age many new yorkers were not happy local dairy producers panicked as the erie railroad brought three million quarts of milk into new york in 1842 by 1849 milk imports were up to nine million but oyster producers were thrilled to see their perishable shellfish speeded to buffalo and points west while blue points now sell for 145 each at the grand central oyster bar , oysters in the 19th century were so abundant that they fed both rich and poor an englishmen named charles mackay , visiting the united states in 1857 , observed that the only class difference in america was between the people who had champagne with their oysters and those who washed them down with beer americans , especially new yorkers , loved oysters they were pickled , fried , stewed and used in sauces copious quantities were involved a single serving of oyster stew contained dozens of oysters amelia simmons s cookbook , published in albany in 1796 and considered the first american cookbook , gives instructions to smother a fowl in oysters , which seems not the worst fate a bird has been known to suffer but the favorite way of eating oysters in new york and the northeast was raw in 19thcentury new york , oysters were opened and served raw with nothing but pepper , salt , lemon juice or vinegar they were offered in bars , at street markets , in hotels and at streetside stands the oyster cellar became as new york an institution as the papaya bar the earliest record is from 1783 , when one opened on broad street the cellars were usually a few steps below street level , and advertised with an oyster balloon by the stairwell these balloons , red muslin globes , were lighted at night , usually until late
rarely is a trial judge thrashed so publicly by an appeals court microsoft and its lawyers were undoubtedly pleased that the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit focused as intently in this week s oral argument on the behavior of judge thomas penfield jackson as on the company s own misconduct but the software giant should not get too confident the more than seven hours of testimony did little to undermine the soundness of judge jackson s central finding that microsoft violated the nation s antitrust laws the very strength of the government s case is what makes judge jackson s behavior especially lamentable in particular , the judge s illadvised public statements about the case for example , comparing microsoft to a drug gang violate judicial norms and create the unfortunate impression that he may have been biased as harry t edwards , the circuit court s chief judge , rightly said the system would be a sham if all judges went around doing this but judge jackson s indiscretions are of secondary importance to the legal issues now before seven judges of the circuit court the judges must measure the significance of his failure to afford microsoft an evidentiary hearing on the appropriate remedy in the case if that is deemed a serious flaw , it need not be fatal the remedy is to remand the case to the lower court for a hearing some on the panel also made it apparent they felt judge jackson had failed to define the market in which microsoft was unfairly seeking to compete that , too , can be cured on remand but none of these uncertainties should obscure the deeper truth of this case the trial record convincingly showed that microsoft illegally abused its windows operating system monopoly to take on competitors developing other applications , such as netscape , in the market for internet browsers it did so by tying its internet explorer to windows and by bullying computer manufacturers who sought to make it easier for consumers to opt instead for netscape s navigator microsoft s predatory behavior was also defensive in nature , as it feared netscape might develop a platform that could threaten the dominance of the windows operating system that sure looks like an illegal effort to maintain the windows monopoly true , some of the appellate judges two of whom ruled in microsoft s favor on this issue in 1998 may believe that internet browsers are integral to a computer s operating system and cannot be thought of as a separate market this argument has since gained more credence in a universe of increasingly webcentric computing devices but the broader point is that competition in developing and marketing other software appliances will be enhanced if microsoft is prevented from again abusing its windows monopoly hence the wisdom of judge jackson s structural remedy , breaking microsoft into two separate companies , one selling the operating system and the second focused on other applications the appeals court may reverse parts of the decision and is likely to remand the case to a different trial judge to further flesh out some of these issues such an action could spur new settlement talks if so , the bush administration should defend consumers' interests as vigorously in this case as did the clinton justice department
prison officials say that nearly 10 , 000 inmates in new york and thousands more across the country are infected with hepatitis c , an insidious liver infection that is difficult to treat , has no definite cure and , over many years , kills 5 percent of those who contract it prison and public health officials are wrestling with how to respond to the surprisingly high rates of infection , trying to figure out how to contain its spread , and how and when to provide expensive treatment that in most cases does not work some states are treating hundreds of prisoners infected with hepatitis c , while others are treating none and beyond concerns about how to manage the problem inside the prisons guards , for instance , fear being infected through contact with inmates' blood health officials worry that prisoners may spread hepatitis c through intravenous drug use when they are released a study to be submitted to congress this fall estimates that 18 percent of state prisoners nationwide or about 360 , 000 inmates are infected with the virus there are still legitimate scientific questions about who the treatment will ultimately benefit , said dr robert greifinger , a senior fellow for the centers for disease control and prevention in atlanta , who conducted the study for the justice department on the other hand , the infection rates are very , very high i just do n't think it s very clear yet how to manage the problem dr greifinger based his study on projections from several state studies many states are just starting to survey inmates for the infection in new york , a firstever survey recently estimated that 14 percent of the state s 69 , 000 prisoners have hepatitis c in pennsylvania , about 17 percent of the state s 36 , 500 prisoners are infected in connecticut , the rate is believed to be 15 percent of 17 , 500 inmates new jersey has not broadly tested for the virus the northeast is hardly alone in grappling with the problem in california , officials estimate that 33 percent of the state s 161 , 000 prisoners have hepatitis c in texas , 28 percent of the state s 157 , 000 prisoners are believed to be infected it s simmering and brewing and if it boils over , the medical costs will be catastrophic , said dr frederick r maue , chief of clinical services for pennsylvania s department of corrections , which is actively treating infected inmates there will be liver transplants , multiple hospitalizations to treat liver failures , and increased numbers of deaths doctors say the problem is not that large numbers of prisoners are contracting hepatitis c while incarcerated most were infected through intravenous drug use and shared needles years ago it is that the infection s breadth and power are only now becoming clear new screening tests developed in the early 1990 s have found that far more people are infected than was ever expected , although many people who contract it suffer few ill effects but some people who were infected as long ago as the 1960 s are dying today , underscoring the fact that the disease can prove fatal over the course of 20 to 30 years hepatitis c causes liver disease in 20 percent of its victims , and eventually kills 5 percent of those infected doctors describe the infection as more of a potential medical time bomb than an immediate public health threat roughly 27 million people in the united states have the infection , which is responsible for 8 , 000 deaths a year hepatitis c is a bloodborne virus that can linger for years without symptoms aside from intravenous drugs users , hundreds of thousands of other people are thought to have contracted the virus from blood transfusions before better screening began in the early 1990 s vaccines exist for two other hepatitis viruses hepatitis a , which can be transmitted by food , food handlers and water , rarely kills those it infects hepatitis b is a sexually transmitted disease that kills 5 , 000 people a year the infection rate among the general population for hepatitis c is far lower 18 percent than in prisons doctors believe that the infections are concentrated among inmates because of their high rate of intravenous drug use before being jailed the infection may also be gradually spreading in prisons studies show that 3 percent to 21 percent of inmates say they engage in intravenous drug use behind bars fortyfour percent of those who reported drug use said they shared needles the infection s death toll is rising and is expected to grow steadily over the next 10 to 20 years in new york prisons last year , where 71 million was spent to treat roughly 1 , 400 inmates with aids , eight inmates died of that disease nine died of illnesses related to hepatitis c the question of how best to treat the infection has provoked debate in medical circles expensive new drug treatments , costing 10 , 000 to 25 , 000 per patient annually , show signs of curbing the infection , but are effective in only 15 percent to 45 percent of cases , and sometimes make patients sicker states are responding differently to the problem in new jersey , for instance , no prisoners are currently being treated , but in pennsylvania , 417 prisoners are new york is treating 95 prisoners at a cost of about 6 million a year

berlin , may 30 any one doubting that germany s bustling capital has money problems need only visit the brandenburg gate , the august archway where president reagan once chastised the soviet union and denounced the berlin wall for months now , the arch has been draped with a different kind of symbolism the pink logo of deutsche telekom , germany s biggest telephone company , and the cheery proclamation we connect unable to meet the cost of renovating the brandenburg gate , the city took up deutsche telekom s offer to pay the bill in exchange , the company received the exclusive right to advertise on the drape that will shroud the arch as the huge wrap of the artist christo once covered the nearby reichstag until the work is finished in another year or so but now berlin is more than just short of money it is teetering on the edge of bankruptcy thanks to huge real estate lending losses uncovered at a citycontrolled bank , the city needs to borrow 2 billion in order to keep the bank afloat but berlin had already accumulated more than 30 billion in debt since germany was glued back together in 1990 , and it was already running another huge deficit this year before the bank problems surfaced the flood of red ink could lead to startling political consequences for years , berlin has been governed by a chilly coalition between the centerright christian democrats and the centerleft social democratic party but now social democrats are threatening to abandon the coalition and call for new elections as if that were not enough , some are even flirting with the idea of teaming up with the successors to eastern germany s old communist party the excommunists , now the party of democratic socialism , still enjoy considerable support in the east and are openly calling for new elections down its avenues and through its plazas , berlin radiates a new glamour and excitement potsdamer platz , at the center of the old berlin wall , now has skyscrapers and shopping complexes the city is packed with eyeopening new architecture , from the new parliament to the many new embassies and hotels berlin mitte , once a wasteland just east of the berlin wall , is now a home to media and technology companies and trendy new cafes but appearances aside , berlin s finances are a mess because east berliners and west berliners have fought to preserve their own institutions , the city has two zoos , two university hospitals , five symphony orchestras and 83 public swimming pools the city owns more than 300 , 000 apartments , rented at well below market rates the city has so many bureaucrats that its payroll alone consumes almost all the money generated from local taxes its debt is so high that its annual interest payments are more than the amount it spends on schools and teachers there is a subsidy mentality , and diepgen was a perfect example of that mentality , said annette fugmannheesing , deputy chairman of berlin s social democratic party and a longtime adversary of the mayor , eberhard diepgen it entails a strong demand for the state to provide services , without much regard for where the money will come from the problems have been a part of this city ever since the fall of the wall but they rose to a crisis two weeks ago , when auditors concluded that the bankgesellschaft berlin , in which the city owns 57 percent of the stock , is technically bankrupt and needs an infusion of about 2 billion like washington , dc , another capital with fiscal problems and a resentful crowd of outoftown critics , berlin is too important to be ignored but this newest predicament has inflamed old resentments in wealthier west german states , which complain they have been bankrolling the city s mismanagement for years under germany s system for redistributing tax revenues between poorer and wealthier states , berlin receives about 4 billion a year on top of the money paid out from federal coffers for being the nation s capital the federal government , controlled by chancellor gerhard schr der and the social democratic party , has refused to provide any direct assistance to make ends meet , the city has in recent years sold off about 10 billion in property , and political leaders are now looking to close down some of their swimming pools and sell yet more cityowned apartments now officials are looking at deep cuts in cultural spending , consolidating university hospitals and eliminating job protection rules for civil servants in the 1990 s , berlin s politicians agreed to pay half the cost of restoring museum island , a complex of museums on an island in the spree river in what was east berlin now , the city wants the federal government to pay a bigger share , and is making a similar case for the costs of orchestras , memorials and the security and police forces associated with being the capital but none of that may be enough to save mayor diepgen , whose ties to the crisisridden bank have increased calls for his resignation the berlin bank was created by city officials shortly after reunification like many other banks , it lent billions of marks for real estate projects here and in eastern germany but when the eastern german real estate market collapsed because of rampant overbuilding nearly four years ago , losses mounted auditors are preparing to write offhuge chunks of the bank s loan portfolio to better reflect lower market values today but some financial experts say the bank s problems and those of berlin itself involve much more bad lending practices there were many signs that the bank was taking on a lot of risk , said ralf rytlewski , a professor of political science at berlin s free university but in the background , it always had guarantees from the city , so it really did not face the same kind of risk as the private banks klaus landowsky , an ally of mayor diepgen and a leader in the berlin branch of the christian democratic union , was a top executive at the bank mr landowsky was forced to resign late last year after admitting that he accepted the equivalent of about 20 , 000 in secret political contributions from two real estate developers who have now defaulted on loans totaling over 300 million , the bank s biggest single loss mayor diepgen has staved off calls for his resignation by arguing that the problems have been exaggerated and that the city will inevitably find a solution for the moment , mr schr der appears opposed to bailing out the capital peter kurth , the senator in charge of municipal finance in the city s ruling senate , said the solution is straightforward the city can simply borrow the money to keep the bank afloat while trying to sell its bank stock photo the brandenburg gate , berlin s enduring symbol , is concealed by a painted covering advertising deutsche telekom the city s financial embarrassment prompted a deal the company pays for the gate s renovation \( joker fotoagentur \)
edmonton , alberta , aug 10 soothing but not erasing unpleasant memories of her stunning loss in the world championship 100 meters , marion jones returned to goldmedal form tonight , if not quite to top form , with a victory in the 200 that clearly came as a relief i do n't know if i had doubts , but i definitely had something to prove to myself , she said it was important to me to come out today and prove i can still get to the finish line first for the past four years , she has proved that difficult point again and again , intimidating her opponents despite her extroverted , accessible manner but jones is clearly not as fresh and fast this year in the wake of last year s draining olympic season , and her silver medal in monday s 100 behind zhanna pintusevichblock gave a lot of fine sprinters a slightly more optimistic vision of their chances after getting off to the slowest start of the eight women in tonight s field , however , jones quickly demonstrated that she intended to control the race , holding her form and gathering speed through the turn when it ended , she held a slight lead and , despite debbie ferguson s partly successful efforts to close the gap , jones still held a slight lead at the finish , winning in 2239 seconds to ferguson s 2252 the american kelli white , who like jones was once a high school phenom , took the bronze medal in her first major championships in 2256 seconds i felt myself getting tired i know what debbie ran yesterday , and i know what she s capable of , jones said , referring to ferguson s leading time in thursday s semifinals but i'm very proud of kelli s bronze it says a lot about the future of women s sprinting in the us it has been a fine championships for american sprinters maurice greene led a united states sweep in the men s 100 but there has not been much reason for optimism in slightly longer races no american woman qualified for the 400 final , and there will be none in sunday s 800 final either hazel clark , the last american hope , withdrew after one lap with an injury in tonight s first semifinal for the first time since 1920 at a world championships or olympics , no american man won a medal in the men s 400 , and for the first time in history , no american man reached the final of the 400 hurdles \( the united states was also missing from the final in 1980 , when the nation boycotted the moscow olympics \) but the united states can lay a claim to the man who won the hurdles race tonight felix sanchez might represent the dominican republic , but he was born in new york and was raised in san diego after moving there with his parents , both dominican immigrants , who moved there when he was 2 a dual citizen , sanchez would gladly have represented the united states if he had sensed any interest instead , this late bloomer agreed to run for the dominican republic , and after narrowly missing the final in last year s olympics , he won the final tonight in 4749 seconds , passing fabrizio mori of italy with about 40 meters remaining and holding him off by fivehundredths of a second sanchez s medal was the dominican republic s first at this level in track and field it means a lot to me to be able to win the first medal for my country , he said our first medal was gold now they 'll expect the same all the time such expectations are nothing strange to jones but she took her very uncharacteristic loss to pintusevichblock with enormous grace in public and kept her eye on the next prize she is still clearly not in top form her time was well off her personal best of 2162 recorded in 1998 , and she was struggling hard down the stretch but she will now have a chance to win a second gold medal here in saturday s 4x100 relay i came here to win the 100 , the 200 and the relay , and the 100 did n't happen , she said prior to this race , i was really emotional i really wanted this today the last time jones competed in the 200 in the world championships , in 1999 in seville , spain , she failed to reach the final at all , but that was not because another sprinter beat her instead , she dropped to the track midway through her semifinal in agony with cramps in her lower back it was the result of a busy season and busy championships schedule she was competing in the long jump in seville , as well as both sprints but in edmonton , she conserved her energy leaving the long jumping to others and though she could do no better than second in the 100 , she was in a fine , apparently relaxed mood before the start tonight waving to the crowd and grinning when her familiar face flashed on the giant television screen in the stadium not many people outside my camp know what s going on in my world or head , she said to sit back and read what s been happening in my life was kind of comical there has been a lot written about gabriela szabo and olga yegorova , as well late thursday night , they lined up in the same heat of the women s 5 , 000 both qualified for saturday s final , with yegorova finishing second and szabo fourth marla runyan , an american who made the olympic 1 , 500 final last year , failed to qualify but the race was not memorable for the order of finish it was memorable for a cardboard sign that was held up by the british distance runner paula radcliffe in the stands that read epo cheats out yegorova has been suspected of epo use since a urine test administered last month in paris showed traces of the banned , enduranceenhancing hormone the test was later dismissed by the international association of athletic federations because the french testing authorities had failed to follow proper procedure we decided the girls in the race should not have to make a protest but we did , said radcliffe , a 10 , 000meter runner who has been a vocal proponent of stricter testing we held it up for two laps the russian guys said what we did was out of order i think we got the point across radcliffe said she and a teammate would have held the sign up longer if stadium security guards had not threatened to confiscate it finish lines three americans qualified for saturday s women s 100meter hurdles final , including the threetime world champion gail devers , whose time of 1256 was the fastest of the year jenny adams , an emerging force , recorded a personal best of 1267 , the thirdfastest time in the heats richard

washington the 250th birthday party for james madison , father of the constitution , took place this past weekend in the library of congress annex named after him when i asked what the word was for a 250th anniversary , the librarian , james billington , instantly coined one quadrimillennial that neologism could mean 4 , 000 years , not onequarter of a millennium , but billington was signaling that american history was no longer to be limited to multiples of mere centennials rather , this republic deserves the long view of fractions of millennia thus our fourth president was born a quarter of a thousand years ago in a brief speech at the dinner , chief justice william rehnquist illuminated the relationship among washington , jefferson , hamilton and the colleague called little jemmy but in praising the way madison fashioned the compromises in the secret conclave that produced our remarkable constitution , the chief pointedly did not hail his presidency that was because madison was pretty much a flop as president it does his memory no service to gloss over this granted , he was saddled by congress in 1809 with the nonintercourse act \( and a law so named would hardly be passed today \) , but he was tricked by napoleon into stumbling , unprepared , into a war with britain the new england states hated that war and threatened secession british forces invaded the us , sacked our capital and dolly madison was lucky to get out of the white house with the portrait of washington not one of our war aims was achieved we never admitted we lost , but the war of 1812 was madison s vietnam with that small blemish on his career recognized , let us see what positive lessons we can learn from the life of the diminutive virginian 1 get yourself a great idea madison s idea was to throw out the weak articles of confederation and establish a strong central government the competing interests in a large country would avert majority tyranny and ensure religious freedom 2 make compromises needed to get most of your idea across , then persuade purists on your side to go along with what they consider a sellout the virginia plan set up two houses of congress to represent the elite and the people but when the small states demanded equal representation in the senate , and madison reluctantly agreed , other bigstate enthusiasts among virginians stormed out of philadelphia madison grimly hung on , allying himself with the brilliant alexander hamilton to write the federalist papers urging ratification 3 do n't fight off improvements distrusters of central power wanted a bill of rights madison came up with a rousing dozen amendments 10 flew and we had a constitution , of which he can truly be considered the father 4 if you have no charisma yourself , find a leader who has it madison became an acolyte of his neighbor thomas jefferson , who disagreed with hamilton s espousal of strong central government as federalists began abusing executive power , madison changed his views and became an allout jefferson loyalist 5 as circumstances change , change with them though madison originally denounced faction , he became a prime mover in starting the antifederalist party and launching partisan politics though his first great idea was central power , at jefferson s direction he wrote the virginia resolution asserting a state s right to interpose itself between its people and federal laws it considered unconstitutional \( a nearnullification theory later used by the confederacy as a precedent for secession \) 6 develop a reputation for keeping your mouth shut madison kept secret his minutes of the philadelphia convention for decades , lest allies be embarrassed and when lighthorse harry lee demanded president jefferson apologize for having made a pass at a neighbor s wife as scandalmonger james callender had charged madison brought the contending parties together in his montpelier home and arranged for a discreet letter from jefferson attesting to the woman s innocence to be shown only to gentry near monticello in sum , madison was an original thinker with a mind flexible enough to became a model follower though his career peaked decades before his presidency , the writing and selling of the constitution was a peak none of his greater contemporaries could claim happy quadrimillennial , jemmy
american aircraft carriers head for the persian gulf , and the president steps up his threats against terrorists it is in times like these , when anger , pain and outraged patriotism are tossed together with talk of war , that moral philosophers , theologians and others who study the ethics of modern warfare begin to worry it was st augustine who said the greatest danger of war is not the physical harm that it causes but the passions that it inspires , said the rev j bryan hehir , a catholic theologian and professor of the practice of religion in society at the harvard divinity school as americans reel from the enormity of the attacks , a moral equation hovers what would be the appropriate , effective and just response by the most powerful nation on earth \? st augustine , the fourth century christian philosopher , was one of the first to tackle the concept of a just war , but the idea of setting limits on when and how wars should be fought is as old as armed combat rules of engagement have evolved it was only after the devastating civilian casualties in world war ii that the geneva conventions for the protection of victims of war were signed in 1949 still , each new war brings another moral quandary and another round of debate this time , as several scholars have noted , the issue lies in the asymmetrical balance of forces on one side is a modern superpower with a full arsenal of hightech weapons restrained by popular moral revulsion at the prospect of inflicting unintended damage on innocent bystanders on the other is a shadowy network of conspirators who may lack modern weapons but have no qualms about killing thousands of victims few moral philosophers except committed pacifists dispute that the united states has just cause to use force in this case but many emphatically reject the use of the word war in anything but a metaphorical sense , noting that in this case the enemy is not a state against which hostilities can be formally declared and from which surrender can be sought it is like the war against crime or drugs , said sir michael howard , a noted military historian it is a way of mobilizing forces , but that is not a war still , the restraints of a justwar doctrine must apply , sir michael continued if one is engaging in police actions against international criminals , it is even more important that we do no more damage to innocent bystanders than is absolutely necessary , he said but those restraints , many agree , are particularly difficult to apply against targets who are not only elusive and covert but who deliberately use the civilian population for cover the response is problematic because it is so hard to identity and isolate the terrorists , and therefore it is hard to aim at them , said michael walzer , a professor of social science at the institute for advanced study in princeton and the author of just and unjust wars a moral argument with historical illustrations , a 1977 classic that sought to give a modern definition to war ethics in calibrating the response , the first task is to clarify both the motives and the goals , several scholars noted mr walzer , among others , rejects the notion of retaliation , which in many ways is simply a code word for revenge it would be a great failure of our political leadership if they were satisfied or persuaded us that we ought to be satisfied with an act of retaliation , he said we could do what the israelis do , which is bomb some empty buildings and claim that is retaliation but i do n't see the point what our leaders are now responsible for , if they are serious , is an effective campaign against terrorism which must be waged on every front , diplomatically , ideologically as well as militarily , he said it should be about effectiveness and not some emotional release the roman catholic church , which starting with st thomas aquinas in the middle ages has elaborated its own doctrine of just war , long ago ruled out revenge as a legitimate motive for use of force the intention must be to prevent injustice , to respond to injustice and to reestablish a just peace , father hehir said the essence of the tradition is that the only morally legitimate response is a limited response father hehir , a jesuit who also teaches at weatherhead center for international affairs at harvard , noted a growing opinion among catholics that all use of force is morally illegitimate that position , he said , has drawn strength from pope john paul ii , who opposed the persian gulf war the pope has supported the use of forces in some cases , he noted , but he has done so with great hesitation stanley hauerwas , a professor of theological ethics at the duke divinity school , is an avowed pacifist who argues that the united states should construe its reaction to the sept 11 attacks as a police action in which the goal is not to kill but to arrest the perpetrators mr hauerwas said he had been absolutely dumbfounded at the ease and haste with which christian leaders in the united states adopted a belligerent stance that in his view is at odds with the teachings of their religion
los angeles , oct 14 sliding in almost as a whisper , with a persistence that has surprised many in hollywood , a 17 million gothic horror film called the others lasted in the weekend box office top 10 for nine weeks until finally slipping out this weekend it has already earned over 93 million , and its cumulative united states gross may creep over 100 million before long it is a classic wordofmouth movie , which is a rare thing and getting rarer , said paul dergarabedian , chairman of exhibitor relations , a los angelesbased company that monitors box office receipts we 've been on this whole kick lately about how movies do n't have legs anymore that was the story this summer when movies opened big and then disappeared after a couple of weekends 'the others' was an anomaly this summer in a sea of films that were dropping like rocks once upon a time , wordofmouth was credited as the driving force behind most of the biggest hits to come out of hollywood but in recent years , as the major studios have focused more and more on huge releases of blockbusters that burn out quickly at the box office , wordofmouth hits have become fewer and fewer there is a formulaic approach sometimes to the types of movies that are made , to the assumption that executives make about them and to the way that they are marketed and the way they are released , said paula wagner , one of the film s executive producers this movie broke a lot of those rules , and that may be a reason for its success hollywood s recordsetting box office year has been spurred by two widely noted forces first , despite the national cataclysm of the sept 11 terrorist attacks and subsequent united states reprisals , americans have continued to go to the movies and second , despite a dearth of critically acclaimed films this year , the hollywood studios have been able to put out one blockbuster after another by cramming them into so many thousands of multiplexes that they need not worry about the inevitable second and third weekend dropoffs but amid all these one and twoweekend wonders there has also been a handful of films like the others that have gone against the grain and racked up long and successful runs by doing it the oldfashioned way , building from one weekend to the next and relying on good wordofmouth from satisfied audiences in other words , they had legs this year s current box office champ , the computeranimated shrek , opened in more than 3 , 500 theaters in early may and actually saw its weekend take go up slightly in its second weekend , an almost unheardof event these days by the end of the summer it had outpaced such heavily hyped blockbusters as pearl harbor and planet of the apes to become the season s top film the others , which opened on aug 10 , is another example , a film that never once was in first in weekend box office results , yet remained in theaters long after many of those first place films had played out their string and disappeared and there are a handful of others , like the princess diaries , which stayed in the box office top 10 for six weeks and earned more than 105 million bridget jones s diary , which spent nine weeks in the top 10 and ended up with more than 70 million and legally blonde , which earned more than 90 million and lasted six weeks in the top 10 because of extra expansion in the number of theaters and seats in recent years , it has become possible to open a film on enough screens that you can actually satisfy your audience very quickly , and there s nothing wrong with that , said jeffrey katzenberg , one of dreamworks' founders and a shrek producer but there is also this other phenomenon the quality of the movies lately has been less than stellar , which is the nicest way i can say it the demand for these films is indeed satisfied quickly , so they come and they 're gone quickly still , he said , when a film hits its target just right and exceeds audience expectations it s possible for it to build the kind of slow , lucrative run that used to be the hallmark of successful movies of previous decades when movies surprise an audience and exceed its expectations , you can still get a wordofmouth hit , mr katzenberg said the thing that took everyone s breath away with shrek' was that it did 1 percent better in its second weekend , and that can only come from one thing people coming out of the theaters and telling their friends that you have to see it there is no substitute for that the others , from the director alejandro amen bar , stars nicole kidman as a war widow living in a creepy mansion on the isle of jersey during world war ii with her two bewildered children and vaguely menacing servants there is no real violence in the film , and the suspense comes from the morbid story , the surprising plot twists and the way mr amen bar uses sound and light to heighten tension bob weinstein , who runs dimension films , the genrebased division of miramax films , the company he founded with his brother , harvey , explained the tactics used in the others release campaign
children are all grown , but support is still owed he was in the news and he had a title king of the deadbeat dads many men had evaded court orders to pay child support , and in the 1990 s , jeffrey a nichols soared into the spotlight as their symbol perhaps it was because he was the first charged in new york city under a 1992 federal law that made it a crime to dodge child support payments by crossing the state line or possibly it was the magnitude of his arrears more than 600 , 000 by 1995 , when he was charged with defying the payment order issued by a manhattan judge who presided over his 1990 divorce the order required mr nichols an investment adviser whose income prosecutors said totaled 1 million from 1992 to 1994 to pay his former wife , marilyn kane , more than 9 , 000 a month to support their three children , who were 11 to 18 at the time of the divorce mr nichols pleaded guilty in 1996 to having fled to florida and vermont to avoid making the payments and was sentenced to six months in jail that followed seven months behind bars for contempt of court mr nichols said business reversals , psychological depression and his second wife s cancer and death , which left him with their two adopted children , had prevented him from paying his first wife since 1996 , mr nichols has been out of the public eye , but not out of the law s jaws on may 3 he is to complete still another sentence a year in a halfway house for a 1999 guilty plea to tax fraud a federal prosecutor , paul van de graaf , said last week that mr nichols had underreported his early 1990 s income by at least 425 , 000 in efforts to evade his support payments mr nichols , 53 , declined to speak with a reporter , said a federal prison administrator , robert manco whatever mr nichols s postrelease plans , ms kane said he still owed her nearly 600 , 000 , having paid less than 40 , 000 of the arrears and though their children are grown and she has remarried and built a postdivorce career as a real estate broker , she still seeks the full amount i was harmed financially and emotionally , she said , citing times when the lack of support payments had left her destitute and there is a message to be sent , she said , that child support arrearages do n't go away lawyer has no regrets for louima case tactics the case of abner louima , tortured in a brooklyn police station , was explosive from its start it became more so when the lawyer for officer justin a volpe , who was charged with ramming a stick into mr louima s rectum after an august 1997 street brawl , suggested at the opening of his client s trial in 1999 that mr louima s internal injuries had resulted from consensual sex with another man but after a sergeant s surprise testimony that officer volpe had boasted of the attack , the officer pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 30 years in prison the defense tactics sparked an ethical debate critics said the lawyer , marvyn m kornberg , scurrilously blamed the victim others backed mr kornberg s position that because he did not know at the trial s start of his client s boasts to the sergeant , he violated no legal ethics in raising every possibility that could have aided mr volpe while the officer was insisting he was not guilty last week , mr kornberg , a longtime controversial courtroom combatant , said he had no second thoughts none at all about his handling of the trial everyone can win the football game on monday , he said the problem is , it s played on sunday photos
after years of little change , jury awards to consumers suing over defective products are rising sharply in many industries , from cars and tools to toys and appliances but at the same time , far fewer such cases are being brought , and many lawyers are turning away clients because their injuries are not debilitating enough to bring in big awards the median award not including punitive damages has more than tripled since 1993 , from 500 , 300 to over 18 million in 1999 , according to a study of 2 , 751 productliability verdicts to be released today by lrp publications , one of the only nonpartisan groups to track cases in several states each year much of that rise has come the last three years , and awards are now growing at the fastest rate in two decades in the mid1980 s , when corporations and politicians warned that a litigation explosion threatened economic growth , the size of defectiveproduct awards actually dropped as often as it climbed but in recent years , they have increased four times as fast as the sums doled out in medical malpractice lawsuits , even though tort reform has been in full swing and juries have begun giving less to the casualties of fender benders and slips and falls there is no way of knowing if american manufacturers are paying more to injured consumers over all most states do not track the number of cases filed much less keep a running tally of outcomes nonetheless , now that george w bush is in the white house , after a campaign in which he emphasized his efforts to limit civil damages in texas , many manufacturers expect him to push for caps on productliability awards at the federal level manufacturers and defense lawyers have long attributed large verdicts in defective product cases to what they call robin hood jurors who relish sitting in judgment of powerful corporations , if only for a day but a growing number of legal scholars say that rising awards are , to a large degree , the unexpected outcome of rules that make it harder to sue manufacturers and win a series of supreme court rulings from 1993 to 1999 , embraced by defense lawyers as a way of knocking out lawsuits against companies , have raised the bar on who can testify as expert witnesses , the backbone of any productliability trial to better their prospects under the new rules , many plaintiffs' lawyers are buttressing their arguments with platoons of experts , and improving their chances of winning by choosing only truly egregious cases involving the most seriously injured parties i 've had plenty of defective products , clearly defective , where i wo n't even talk to the people because their injuries are n't severe enough , said craig e hilborn , president of hilborn hilborn , a small law firm in birmingham , mich if they 're not a quadriplegic , a paraplegic or losing some part of their body , there s no way i'm going to take that case in fact , the number of productliability cases filed in federal court has dropped by more than half the last four years , from 32 , 856 in 1997 to 14 , 428 in 2000 , according to the administrative office of the united states courts a reflection , some legal scholars say , of how selective many lawyers have become it is not that the lawyers are unsympathetic , legal experts argue , but rather a matter of economics with the greater emphasis on expert witnesses , productliability suits are increasingly expensive to bring , often costing well above 100 , 000 for many lawyers , who usually bear the cost of trying a case and are paid only if they win , picking more seriously injured clients is the surest way to meet expenses and make the substantial risk of losing worthwhile i ca n't take cases on any more unless i am absolutely positive that i have one worth at least 2 million , said james l gilbert , president of the attorney information exchange group , an organization of about 500 plaintiffs' lawyers nationwide i can no longer afford to spend 300 , 000 trying a case that is only worth 500 , 000 , and that s ridiculous for some injured consumers , juries will award more money than their lawyers ask for in 1997 , when a washing machine made by pellerin milnor kept spinning , even with the lid open , a curious 4yearold named malik singletary reached inside after 13 hours of surgery , his arm was reattached , but it functioned poorly and left no feeling in his hand in the 30 years or so the machine has been on the market , at least four other lawsuits for strikingly similar injuries had been filed against pellerin milnor , and none had yielded more than a 50 , 000 settlement , the company said but after the singletarys sued for 1 million , the los angeles jury that heard their case in 1999 awarded 5 million i 've never seen anything like that , said gregory yates , the family s lawyer , who has been practicing for 28 years the insurance industry is blaming the escalating awards for the doubledigit increases for basic coverage that many businesses are now facing they are the highest rate increases since the liability crisis of the mid1980 s , the industry says , when playgrounds were chained shut and diving boards were stripped from pools for fear of the injuries and lawsuits they might induce
greg maddux ambled up the runway to the thirdbase dugout at shea stadium around 5 30 yesterday , noticed the blue tarpaulin spread across the infield and quickly determined it would be an excellent night to pitch huh \? it was raw and damp , and the baseball would feel like a snowball how could such conditions be helpful \? simple maddux figured it would be much easier to throw a snowball than to hit it inning after inning , through a misty rain and a slicing wind , maddux and rick reed proved that reed used 10 pitches to slide through the first inning , and maddux needed 13 reed used an enhanced curveball to stifle the braves , and maddux used his routine assortment of precise pitches to baffle the mets it was wet it was quick it was artistic the braves nicked reed for a cheap run in the third , chipper jones smashed a homer in the seventh and maddux , his left big toe turning blacker and bluer , just kept on churning he gave up one single in seven innings and he retired 21 of the 22 batters he faced in powering the braves to a tidy 20 victory yes , it was a good night to pitch it usually is for greg maddux it was a ballgame we 've played a million times over the last 10 years , winning , 20 , or 21 , manager bobby cox said maddux can do that any time out just about there is an unbelievable beauty about what maddux does none of his pitches measured faster than 88 miles an hour , but he was as dominant as pedro mart nez he did not walk a batter and struck out six he said he felt his toe on every step , yet added that it affects everything but the way i pitch maddux said the pain from the broken nail and laceration incurred in his final spring training start caused him to lose focus , and that was why he departed after seven innings when maddux s gem was over , he returned to his role of being the best pitching nerd in the national league al leiter of the mets says that maddux revels in being viewed as goofy , when he is really one of the premier pitchers of the last 25 years yet maddux discussed his almost perfect night as if he were reviewing an episode of sesame street , his answers as empty as the mets' offense i located pretty well , maddux said , the only time he complimented himself do not try to think with him if you try to outguess him , he will make you look foolish expect a fastball on the inside corner , and he will float a curveball over the outside corner he is like a parent watching three toddlers , always thinking two or three moves ahead two hours before the mets opposed maddux , that was the scouting report darryl hamilton provided hamilton seemed like the perfect candidate to dissect maddux because he entered last night s game with 7 hits in 13 atbats against the fourtime cy young award winner but hamilton had doubts because after discussing his success against the righthander , the knocked on a wooden panel he puts himself in your position as a hitter and outthinks you , hamilton said i know i try like heck to know what he s going to do sometimes it works , and sometimes it does n't last night , it did not work hamilton struck out twice , went 0 for 3 and said , look at his record , he s not normal the future hall of famer , who is 241135 in his career , denied that he creeps inside batters' heads i'm trying to worry about myself , maddux said i do n't want to think like a hitter you start trying to read minds and it gets complicated i only try to get them to just hit it in front of the outfielders somewhere if todd zeile , who initially tried to bunt for a hit , did not battle through a sevenpitch atbat and bounce a single between second and first in the second inning , maddux would have been pursuing a nohitter things grew so desperate for the mets that fans cheered when zeile slapped a onehopper in the sixth at least zeile hit it hard maddux showed how smooth he can be in the second with an 02 count on mike piazza , maddux uncorked a high , inside fastball that backed piazza up and caused his helmet to fall off piazza was leaning in and was slow to avoid the pitch , which maddux noted maddux tossed one ball then he snapped a sweet curveball on the outside corner and piazza looked awkward while whiffing it was a savvy display , but maddux acted as if he did not recall it you just kind of invent it as you go along , he said it was another hohum night , maddux said he could have been hurt by a fastball up to piazza and a changeup he hung to edgardo alfonzo , and no one understood how difficult it was for infielders to corral soggy grounders maddux continually deflected the focus on what had been a good night , a very good night to pitch mad dog s got an aboveaverage fastball , but he does n't even have a breaking ball , leiter said he s got superior movement on the fastball , and he s got a great changeup that s what he uses that s how he does it and he s been the greatest pitcher of our era photo rick reed , who pitched nine innings in a steady rain last night at shea , waiting for the grounds crew to finish working on the mound \( barton silverman the new york times \)
brussels , may 8 resisting pressure to cut it short , the european commission will carry to completion its investigation of the general electric company s planned acquisition of honeywell international , the commission confirmed today if it wins approval , the 45 billion deal would combine ge s dominant position in the global aircraftengine market with honeywell s strength in avionics and other aircraft components united states department of justice officials cleared the deal with conditions last week , leaving european approval as the last remaining legal obstacle the commissioner in charge of competition issues , mario monti , said european antitrust regulators would be sending ge an official statement in the next few days detailing their objections to the deal as it stands , a step he described as routine once it has that document , ge is expected to ask for a hearing before the commission late this month or early in june to respond mr monti said he was confident all parties will continue their fruitful cooperation in the meantime mr monti s positive tone and recent gestures have prompted speculation that the commission has softened its position on the deal today , he said that talks so far had been constructive , but several aspects of the deal remained worrisome we have concerns with regard to possible bundling , or tying , that could allow the new entity to extend its dominant position from one market to another , mr monti said , referring to packagedeal arrangements that offer customers incentives to buy a host of different products from one company , making comparisonshopping harder ge is believed to have offered the commission a promise that it would be open about separate prices for individual products and not hide them in package deals , but neither side would comment on the matter mr monti declined to say what if any other aspects of the deal the commission feared would be anticompetitive , though he did say that the socalled portfolio effects are not an issue we do not have any concern with regard to a merger which only extends the range of products of the merged entity , mr monti said ge refused to comment on the substance of discussions under way with the commission ge is happy to talk about any issues the commission raises , a company spokeswoman , louise binns , said today she added that the company still believed that there were no meaningful antitrust problems arising from the deal rivals and customers have told the commission they do not see it that way aircraft builders , component makers , airlines , leasing companies and maintenance contractors have all sent statements of concern , though none are known to have lodged a formal complaint these informal responses from rivals have pointed to the market power of an aircraft leasing division , ge capital aviation services , which is one of the world s largest buyers of commercial aircraft general electric has reportedly offered to allow competing avionics makers , like the rockwellcollins unit of rockwell international and thales sa of france , to bid on an equal footing with honeywell for contracts to equip aircraft that the leasing unit buys neither the company nor the commission would comment on the matter such a policy would depart from ge s present practice of having the leasing unit buy only aircraft equipped with ge engines , shutting out its two rivals , rolls royce plc and the pratt whitney division of united technologies the commission has set itself a deadline of july 12 to complete its inquiry and make a decision on the deal lawyers in brussels who are following the case said they believed that the commission would ultimately approve the takeover , but with conditions similar to those it imposed on honeywell s proposed merger with allied signal in december 1999 one principal concession offered by the companies in the alliedhoneywell case was an agreement not to sell their avionics and nonavionics products jointly i would n't be surprised if similar behavioral conditions were attached to a positive ruling in this case , too , one lawyer said photo mario monti , european commissioner in charge of competition , said antitrust regulators would be sending ge a statement soon \( associated press \)
on a recent sweet summer evening on a sidewalk in brooklyn , two acquaintances , middleclass black men approaching 40 , got to talking the conversation turned , as it often does in fort greene , to the three r s race , riches and real estate they played the licenseplate game look at these cars , said dezo el , pointing at the sedans and suv s hugging the curb of south elliott place vermont my man here is from connecticut that car over there says virginia the woman across the street has north carolina plates the other man nodded his agreement i do n't mind when a community changes , said the man , a photographer with a saltandpepper beard who gave his name only as gregory but the way it s changing , it s not changing for me and you it s changing for them he turned to a passerby , expecting an amen but the passerby , earl avery , was having none of it you ca n't say it s not changing for the better for us , mr avery said a lot of black folks who owned homes here took the money and ran , moved to staten island or down south or wherever i live here , and it s changing for the better for me the difference between the men is that mr avery , 44 , a solidly built former gym teacher who scrimped and saved his way out of the fort greene projects , is a homeowner himself he has several buildings in the neighborhood while gregory is an increasingly skittish renter the city s latest wave of gentrification is hitting fort greene full force , pushing tenants of all races from their brownstone apartments even as it lines dekalb avenue with hip new restaurants but in a twist on the standard script , some of the prime beneficiaries of the boom in fort greene \( besides the real estate agencies that form an economic development zone unto themselves \) have been middle and workingclass blacks nurses and mailmen and civil servants who bought their houses cheap in the 60 s , 70 s and 80 s and kept the community together while most other black neighborhoods in the city were falling apart the very people who bought their brownstones during white flight are the same people who are making money selling to the upper classes now , said jerry minsky , a senior vice president of the corcoran group , the manhattan real estate giant , who runs its new fort greene office although it may be heartening to think of grandma riding off into the sunset with a suitcase full of cash , the new order has created hard feelings and it has brought a growing fear that fort greene a home of the black american dream with a proud history of racial integration , art and culture is becoming just another yuppie haven when mr avery said that he would rent one of his apartments to the first person willing to fork over 1 , 500 a month if the black tenant currently paying 800 moved out , gregory all but called him a traitor that s the problem , gregory snapped you got people like you renting to whoever can pay the rents , and it s mostly white folks , and there goes the neighborhood in fact , the white influx into fort greene is not as farreaching as it may seem in the center of the neighborhood , south and east of fort greene park , where about a quarter of its 35 , 000 residents live , the white population has jumped 47 percent since 1980 , while the black population is down 8 percent , according to the census but over all , not even counting the overwhelmingly nonwhite projects , the percentage of fort greene residents who are white has increased only to 25 percent from 23 percent since 1980 , and the percentage of blacks has dipped only slightly , to 59 percent from 63 percent the common denominator of the newcomers is not race but money household income tripled from 1980 to 1997 , the most recent year for which statistics are available , to 55 , 650 from 18 , 250 , in 1997 dollars , according to the census the couples who pack the tables at chez oskar and the butta cup on dekalb and stroll beneath the plane trees among the milliondollar homes on south portland avenue are as diverse and as striking as a benetton ad but perception , to a certain extent , is reality earlier this summer , the opening of a sushi restaurant , that beachhead of white urban culture , was widely viewed as a sinister omen the day that the sushi restaurant opened , it was packed , and the customers were predominantly white , said letitia james , a black candidate for city council whose campaign office on greene avenue is just down the street and i heard people in their conversations that night 'what it is , we 're being pushed out' notwithstanding mr avery s sunny outlook , many longtime homeowners who have decided to stay put feel bittersweet crime is way down , and there is an undeniable joy in watching one s home equity

washington , nov 19 only a few days after the world trade center attack , president bush summoned members of new york s congressional delegation to the white house there , the republican president promised to help new york recover and then pledged 20 billion to get things started even the most partisan democrat there was moved by the gesture but by last week , all that good will seemed to have vanished , and with it perhaps at least half of the 20 billion new york lawmakers were summoned back to the white house , only this time to be taken down a notch vice president dick cheney , the president s enforcer on capitol hill , wanted them to back away from their threat to introduce legislation intended to force the administration to hand over all the money mr bush had promised the contrast between those two meetings captured , in many ways , how far new york has already fallen in washington s hierarchy of priorities , as the nation wages a war in afghanistan and confronts the threat of more domestic terrorist attacks some reasons for new york s predicament are beyond its control , like the nation s slumping economy , which makes the overall demand for federal money much higher than it has been in years but at least part of the blame rests with new york officials themselves , lawmakers from both parties say the state s federal , state and city representatives often seem to have different , if not competing , agendas at times , it has been hard to tell who is really doing the talking for new york in washington last week , for example , mayor rudolph w giuliani seemed to undercut the lobbying efforts of his successor , michael r bloomberg , who had traveled to washington and joined members of new york s congressional delegation in calling on the administration to make good on the president s 20 billion promise the next day mr giuliani criticized such efforts , saying that he believed that the bush administration would eventually move to fulfill the president s commitment what i would urge on everyone is to have a cooperative relationship rather than some of the fingerpointing that seems to be beginning , mr giuliani said i think it should be nipped in the bud and a cooperative relationship should replace it , and the city will get far more that way mr giuliani s comments infuriated some new york lawmakers , who said it undermined their efforts to pressure the white house to give the state the money it was promised if the mayor says that new york does n't need all the money right now , that hurts our cause , said a congressional aide why would he do that \? new york s case has been undermined in other ways , most notably by what democrats and republicans characterize as missteps by gov george e pataki a few weeks ago , mr pataki submitted a 54 billion bailout request to washington that sought money for , among other things , projects that had nothing to do with the events of sept 11 that plan was met with derision from democrats and republicans on the hill who saw it as opportunistic then , after a few trips to washington to sell his plan , mr pataki assumed a lower profile and seemed to cut back on his lobbying efforts the governor appeared reluctant to take a position when a bipartisan group of new york lawmakers in congress moved last week toward a showdown with the white house by introducing legislation that would have provided new york with the money agreed to by the president \( the measure sought 973 billion on top of roughly 10 billion the white house has sought to provide new york \) in the end , the legislation was defeated by the house appropriations committee after the white house pressured lawmakers to oppose it afterward , many new york lawmakers accused mr pataki , a republican , of sitting on his hands and refusing to use whatever influence he has with the white house to help their cause these lawmakers none of whom wanted to be identified publicly because they feared antagonizing the governor , whose help they need say that mr pataki s silence was all the more remarkable because the showdown with the white house was led by two upstate new york republicans with close ties to the governor , representatives john e sweeney and james t walsh mr pataki s office has yet to say what the governor s position is on the matter , despite repeated requests over the last week it was n't supposed to turn out this way many lawmakers even expected the 20 billion pledge by the president to be a down payment not the entire amount that new york would need from the federal government to recover from the attack as things stand , the white house says that new york will eventually get all the money the president promised , though it has n't said exactly when that will be to date , the bush administration and congress have earmarked from 92 billion to 95 billion for new york s recovery effort after last week s standoff , the white house agreed to increase the earmarked figure by 2 billion many new york lawmakers say they are skeptical of the white house s 20 billion promise because the money was to have come from a 40 billion package that congress approved after sept 11 to pay for military operations , antiterrorism measures and disaster relief only about a quarter of that 40 billion package was set aside for new york the lawmakers say they are concerned that washington will stall on delivering the rest of the money now that it has a slew of new expenses a war in afghanistan and antiterrorism efforts here at home at a time when the national economy is in steady decline worse , they wonder , what will happen if there is another major attack in the united states before washington gives new york the money it was promised \? some new york lawmakers and their aides say the situation is especially troubling because they could be moving on to other pressing matters , instead of having to haggle over money that was already promised the state s two senators , charles e schumer and hillary rodham clinton , have had some success in moving a 5 billion economic stimulus package for new york through their own chamber many people feel a version of that plan would have a better chance of passage in the senate and the house if the state s delegation focused on getting behind it rather than fighting over the 20 billion that the president had agreed to as one congressional aide from new york put it a promise is a promise why should you have to fight so hard for something you already have \?

glen cove , ny , june 22 shortly after the village of farmingdale shut down a dusty outdoor hiring center for hispanic day laborers , glen cove has taken a different approach , creating an indoor center with padded chairs , a bathroom and english classes for those unlucky enough to remain jobless by 9 am the center , which quietly opened on june 11 , is the only indoor hiring hall for immigrants on long island it consists of five sparsely furnished rooms on the ground floor of a stucco and brick industrial building near the long island rail road s sea cliff station the center may look inconspicuous , and the workers available sign in front of the building is easy to miss but what is striking is the contrast between its lowkey opening and the highprofile rejection of such sites elsewhere on long island , where spanishspeaking immigrants manicure the lawns but are not always welcomed otherwise in april , suffolk county rejected a plan to spend 80 , 000 in county money on a similar center in farmingville , a flashpoint since last fall , when two mexican workers were attacked by men posing as contractors and in farmingdale , about 12 miles southeast of glen cove in nassau county , officials closed their 14monthold site earlier this month after complaints from residents there is an incredible irony that you have two completely different approaches , and you wonder why , said the rev allan b ramirez , pastor of the brookville reformed church and an advocate for long island s immigrant workers so far , the glen cove site has not attracted the kind of objections that were voiced in farmingville , where a group called the sachem quality of life organization spearheaded the opposition , or in farmingdale , where the group advised residents who opposed the hiring site sachem has not jumped into the fray in glen cove because the residents have not asked it to , said ray wysolmierski , a spokesman we do not want anybody to say we 're poking our noses into business that s none of ours , he said , calling the center misguided nonetheless yes , you want to help people , but if we make the invaders happy , what do you think is going to happen \? he said they 're going to stay la fuerza unida de glen cove , the nonprofit organization running the glen cove center with money donated by charities and the city s community development agency , plans to bring in computers and a roster of courses , including spanish for those illiterate in their mother tongue and business lessons for those who hope to be on the other end of the hiring process someday the development agency spent 65 , 000 in federal grant money to refurbish the space that the owner , richard t mohring jr , donated to la fuerza , giving them a free fiveyear lease for now , the center provides a television set to help pass the time , and english lessons to make good use of the waiting but distractions end when someone like robert e boisits jr walks in the door if there s somebody down here that s looking for work and wants to put in an honest day s work for an honest day s pay , that s the person that s for me , mr boisits said he needed a righthand man to help with the lugging , moving and furniture rearranging that is part and parcel of his floor covering business the outdoor hiring sites , he said , had made him uncomfortable for seven years , the glen cove workers had gathered outdoors , about a mile away from the new center but steering toward a cluster of workers was not his style i do n't like to just pick somebody up off the street that i do n't know , he said i'm in and out of a lot of homes , and i need somebody who s trustworthy mr boisits was matched up with mauro medrano , 35 , who had worked as a credit agent in a bank back in honduras and now settles for anything that comes along a strong advocate for the glen gove center is mayor thomas r suozzi , who is also the chairman of the community development agency and a democratic candidate for nassau county executive he called it a rational , logical , fair , equitable solution to a real problem this is not going to just go away because people are yelling and screaming about it , he said nelson salguero , who is 23 and from guatemala , arrived at 5 30 this morning , but as 9 o'clock approached , he began to despair i 'll have to go on a diet , he moaned but a few minutes later he was breathing a little easier he was among eight men headed for work another 39 had to wait , and hope photo robert e boisits jr , left , speaking to jorge carreras , right , about hiring mauro medrano \( ed betz for the new york times \)
laurens , sc the trailer is white and narrow , a starter model with black shutters it sits off a wooded road outside this rundown town , which missed most of the last decade s boom but is catching every bit of this year s bust the trailer is deserted but not empty dirty pans fill the sink trash overflows a blue plastic bin tiny shoes , a broken stroller and a small book titled god s gift to mothers are strewn across the stained green carpet a baby doll lies lost on the floor the trailer was financed by conseco in 1998 and repossessed by conseco in 2001 this is how easy money looks , three years later most of america never noticed , but the 1990 s were good times for trailer homes , a k a manufactured housing from 1991 to 1998 , annual sales of manufactured homes more than doubled , to 374 , 000 from 174 , 000 one company , one man and one accounting rule drove that growth green tree financial , a minnesota lender , financed more than 40 percent of all manufactured homes sold in the united states during the industry s peak lawrence m coss ran green tree as chairman and chief executive , taking home 200 million in pay during the boom the rule , a rarely used accounting convention called gain on sale , encouraged green tree to make as many loans as possible and allowed it to report more than 2 billion in profits that never existed to meet the surge in demand created by green tree , home manufacturers opened scores of factories thousands of dealers , who sold the homes , set up lots nationwide in the south in particular , manufactured homes proliferated , and in south carolina , the epicenter of the boom , they made up more than half of all new homes sold in 1997 and 1998 in their rush to lend , green tree and its rivals made loans to borrowers who had little chance of paying them back tens of thousands of those people have already defaulted and have been evicted conseco alone has repossessed 25 , 000 homes so far this year , after a record 28 , 466 in 2000 by the time the industry s hangover ends later this decade , hundreds of thousands more lowincome borrowers will lose their homes they will wind up with huge debts and ruined credit because their homes are worth far less than what they owe green tree is now conseco finance , the lending arm of conseco , the financial company based in carmel , ind mr coss , who did not return calls seeking comment , retired in 1998 and owns a ranch in river falls , wis gainonsale accounting has been relegated to the dustbin of finance the manufactured housing industry , meanwhile , is foundering only about 180 , 000 new homes will be sold this year factories are closing as quickly as they opened during the fat years , and tens of thousands of jobs are gone dealers are shuttering , too in south carolina alone , the number has fallen to less than 400 from a peak of 620 in 1998 greed overcame logic , said walter r young jr , chairman of champion enterprises , the largest maker of manufactured homes , a publicly traded company based in auburn hills , mich builders and dealers share the blame for expanding too quickly , mr young said , but without green tree and other finance companies , the boom would not have been possible you always have to follow the cash , he said loose money fans it , and everything got carried away the future of conseco , which makes loans and sells insurance mainly to middle and lowincome consumers , is also in doubt after buying green tree in 1998 , the company went on its own binge under stephen c hilbert , its wellpaid chairman conseco s spree peaked in 1999 , when it financed 63 billion in new manufactured homes , 41 percent of the national total but facing mounting losses from bad loans and a plunging stock price , conseco s board forced out mr hilbert in april 2000 and soon replaced him with gary c wendt , the former chairman of ge capital mr hilbert did not return calls this year , conseco has cut back sharply on manufacturedhome lending but conseco is still saddled with 26 billion in loans on trailer homes , including more than 20 billion from the days of mr hilbert and mr coss many top wall street investors , including carl c icahn , the onetime corporate raider , have sold conseco s stock short , betting that it will fall losses on the trailer loans , along with problems at conseco s insurance business , will bankrupt the company by the middle of next year , the shortsellers say june of 2002 looks to be very hairy , said m w montgomery of rocker partners , a hedge fund that has sold conseco s shares short since the fall of 1999 , when they traded above 20 it s becoming clear to everybody that this game stops then , if not sooner according to conseco s own projections , it will produce only about 800 million in cash from its operations next year yet it has 14 billion in debt and interest payments and dividends coming due the bears say that the cash flow estimate is optimistic even if it proves accurate , conseco , which already has more than 6 billion in debt and preferred stock , may have a hard time finding enough money to make up the difference on wednesday , fitch , a bond rating agency , lowered its rating on conseco finance s debt to ccc , indicating that default is a real possibility in an interview on tuesday , mr wendt said the company could easily meet its debt payments next year , by selling assets if necessary

three people were injured and scores fled in panic when a metal beam dislodged from the ceiling of a subway tunnel and ripped through a train car as it pulled into a downtown manhattan station yesterday morning , the police said none of those hurt in the accident , which occurred as the northbound no 5 train headed toward the bowling green stop , were injured seriously but in a city still on edge following sept 11 , it sent a spasm of anxiety through passengers , many of whom feared that the incident which left some covered with dust and debris was another terrorist attack witnesses said that some people were almost trampled as panicked riders streamed toward the doors of the train and up the stairs to street level they were joined by bewildered and alarmed passengers on the platform who saw the train s ruined lead car pull in and also feared the worst it was incredible to me because of what happened on sept 11 , said charlotte mckenzie , 54 , who was sitting in the train s lead car , only a few feet from where the metal beam pierced the car s skin i just knew it was all over i said , 'this is it we 're finished' the incident occurred just before 8 am , when , the police said , a piece of a metal rod used to reinforce concrete broke away from the ceiling of the subway tunnel just south of the bowling green station the police said that it was still unclear last night why the beam tore away from the ceiling , and investigators were examining the train car at the 180th street rail yard in upper manhattan it s still under investigation , said deirdre parker , a spokeswoman for new york city transit , and it probably will be under investigation for a while train service on the 4 and 5 lines was limited after the accident , and was delayed at some stations for more than two and a half hours while workers studied the site the no 4 line had no brooklynbound service for much of the morning the accident happened just as the no 5 rumbled toward its first manhattan stop after leaving brooklyn ms mckenzie said she was seated near the front of the very first car , ticking off a mental checklist of her secretarial duties for the day we were sitting there and i just heard this poppoppoppop , she said before she could look up , debris rained down on her and other passengers there were loud metal sounds people started screaming all this dust and debris came over everyone , she said the dust , she said , was chillingly familiar i was the same kind of dust you saw on the day of the world trade center , she recalled i said , 'oh , god , this is it' the train began moving through the tunnel faster apparently an attempt by the motorman , who was unhurt , to get his passengers to safety but ms mckenzie feared that this , too , was a bad sign we just started going faster and faster , she said i said , 'oh , no , the motorman s hurt , the train s out of control' what happened next was a blur someone shouted for everyone to move to the back of the subway car the train squealed to a halt at bowling green the doors opened passengers ran people were almost stepping on each other , ms mckenzie said someone helped ms mckenzie find emergency workers then she was at new york university downtown hospital , complaining of aches and a slight burn to her hand that she attributed to the dust she was released yesterday afternoon a man who had been standing near the front of the subway car , llewellyn griffith , 29 , of brooklyn , was most seriously injured , the police said he suffered cuts and a fractured vertebrae and was being treated last night at bellevue hospital center another passenger , rose figueroa , 55 , of brooklyn , was also treated at downtown hospital and released as for ms mckenzie , she was recovering at her daughter s home last night and she said she was dubious about officials' preliminary explanation of what happened i do n't know what i'm feeling , she said emotionally , i was terrified but now , i just feel blessed

senators charles e schumer and hillary rodham clinton met at a manhattan middle school yesterday with chancellor harold o levy , teachers' representatives and others to examine what they see as the crux of the system s problems the chronic teacher shortage calling it the most important issue that is confronting our city , bar none , senator schumer said the only way to prevent and avert the crisis that is among us was with help from washington senators schumer and clinton , speaking at a news conference at booker t washington junior high school in manhattan , detailed amendments that each had sought in the senate education bill to help attract and retain teachers senator clinton s amendment , which was approved last week , provides 250 million a year for teacher recruitment most of the money goes toward hiring teachers in school districts with large numbers of poor students two pending amendments by senator schumer would attempt to recruit math and science teachers with scholarships , signing bonuses and professional development for many years , new york city has closed the gap between the number of teachers it needs and the number of qualified applicants by hiring uncertified teachers but the board of regents has decided that by 2003 , all teachers must be certified we do n't have enough certified teachers now , and we will not be closing in on that gap , mr levy said , saying that 60 percent of the teachers hired last year were uncertified
by 4 o'clock sunday , i had a knot in my stomach as big as a titleist hp tour ball waiting for the masters to begin although the masters is contemplating an expansion to 18hole coverage at next year s final round \( on sunday , cbs started at the 6th \) , i pray they do n't if i want early results , i can find them on the masters' web site for television , though , i want to maintain the aura of anticipation and my ability to shop for groceries into the afternoon would tiger woods s victory have been more edifying if the coverage had begun at 2 30 \? that would make it like the other majors , which the masters of the masters do not want the masters' rationed television time is utterly retro , like its simple logo that did not pass muster with a carefully selected focus group , its demand that cbs show no program promos and its ban on mentioning the prize money , as if it were dirty preserving the threehour block on sundays is as central to its charm as the azaleas at augusta national , the four minutes of commercials per hour and the inane green jacket ceremony , hosted by your good buddy hootie johnson , a south carolina banker and the chairman of the augusta national golf club \( hootie , who was born william w , got his nickname , for unknown reasons , from the son of his family s cook , he told golfweek magazine in 1998 \) heck , it s even become a modern tradition to bar cbs s gary mccord and his wiseguy style from the masters broadcast sean mcmanus , the president of cbs sports , no longer mentions paroling mccord to hootie and his pals whatever keeps the tournament pure must be preserved if cbs can maintain the level of its telecast on sunday , the augustans are likely to keep awarding it oneyear masters contracts that are as coveted as the masters blazers jim nantz exuded quiet authority golf is demonstrably his best sport and the masters' premium on restraint suits him perfectly and ken venturi rebounded from problems with clarity last year by displaying a keen knowledge of the course and where driven and putted balls could or should wind up nantz defined the subtle approach when a camera caught woods s face in closeup after his tee shot at 18 that was a confident look , nantz said confident \? it looked like he 'd swallowed his prey but you ca n't say such things at augusta nantz resisted the urge to gush too much at what woods had achieved , when , at the end , he birdied the 72nd hole to finish 16 under par there it is , he said , as grand as it gets one sensed that just as nantz , venturi and the rest of cbs wanted to be present at the creation of the tiger slam , they were subtly hoping that phil mickelson and or david duval would mount formidable challenges to keep tiger from winning his fourth consecutive major even his misses are missed with great confidence , david feherty said about mickelson , a remark that he knew sounded contradictory no yippylooking , tentative shots but the cbs crew had to admit , in its subsequent criticism , that there are reasons why mickelson and duval have never won majors we 've seen an inordinate number of pushed shots , bobby clampett said , referring to mickelson venturi and nantz exhibited a few minutes of sustained amazement that duval missed a crucial birdie putt on the 18th , following a masterly approach shot that had been correctly choreographed by venturi i 'd have bet anything he makes this putt , venturi said afterward then , after mickelson and woods made pars on the 17th , nantz returned to duval s blunder the one at 18 was just shocking , he said added venturi i thought it was in but he did n't even hit the hole the cbs production hews to the augustans' prescribed austerity few modern toys and frills no fancy 3d animation showing course topography \( which would be helpful \) , relatively few replays \( and none whooshed onto the screen \) and a minimum of snappy graphics the audio picked up comments , but nothing naughty and cbs continues its style of just the shots , hootie , just the shots cbs was refreshingly candid at labeling which shots were live and which were taped earlier none of woods s shots were shown on tape sunday , but four by mickelson , and a few by duval , were to cbs s credit , though , it never cut from the middle of a rival s bunker shot \( as abc bbc did last year at the british open \) , to tiger marking his ball remarkable as woods s achievement is , it is not unique , although nantz and venturi were at a loss to find comparisons here s some help , from another individual sport tennis grand slams were all won in calendar years by don budge , rod laver , maureen connolly , margaret smith court and steffi graf maybe secretariat , among the 11 thoroughbred triple crown winners , is woods s equine match because he so exceeded his rivals two lingering points why does n't cbs show the results of the masters' opening tee shots by sammy snead and byron nelson \? they swing , then nothing and does a repeat masters winner get another jacket \? if he does , what did hootie mean when he said , i know that coat fits tiger because he s had it on before

newark , sept 10 acting gov donald t difrancesco suggested today that racism might have played a role in the collapse of plans for a downtown arena here that he had hoped would be his political legacy this is just speculation , mr difrancesco said in informal remarks before opening a conference on racial profiling in atlantic city i 've wondered over the last few months if some of the people who did n't like the thought of building this arena in newark were of the mind that perhaps it should n't be there for nothing other than their own personal bias , or maybe there s a little racism involved , bigotry involved later , mr difrancesco added , i'm just being a realist here mr difrancesco had been a key supporter of a newark arena , which would replace the continental airlines arena in the meadowlands sports complex as the home of the new jersey nets and devils professional basketball and hockey teams mr difrancesco , a republican state senate president who succeeded former gov christie whitman in february , had planned to run for governor in november , but dropped out of the race after embarrassing revelations about his past business and legal dealings , and will step down in january mr difrancesco did not specify to whom he was referring in his remarks about bias and racism , and a spokesman asked later to clarify the remarks also declined to be specific he s not pointing fingers at anybody , said the spokesman , tom wilson certainly none of the candidates mr wilson s denial aside , mr difrancesco has had frosty relations with the republican candidate for governor , bret d schundler , and the two have openly warred over the arena plan mr schundler claimed credit for killing the project after he campaigned loudly for a statewide referendum on it mr schundler , the former mayor of jersey city , insisted that taxpayers should have a say in whether they be put in a position to repay debt on the 355 million arena , which would be financed by the teams' owner , yankeenets city and county money , and a special retail tax support for the arena also began to erode as legislators demanded projects in their own districts , including a new sports and entertainment complex at the meadowlands in east rutherford , in exchange for their votes a spokesman for mr schundler , tom gallagher , declined to say whether he believed the acting governor was suggesting mr schundler s opposition to the arena was motivated by racism but the schundler campaign issued a statement criticizing mr difrancesco s remarks this is nothing more than a coordinated effort by trenton insiders to draw voter attention away from the fact that they tried yet again to issue hundreds of millions of dollars in state debt without asking the people s permission , the statement said another schundler supporter , the rev clenard childress , pastor of the new calvary baptist church in montclair , a black minister who leads an overwhelmingly black congregation , said it was obvious that mr difrancesco was calling mr schundler a racist , although mr childress said the notion was absurd mr schundler was twice elected to fouryear terms as mayor of a predominantly black and hispanic city and i think it s very sad when people who have not reached their own political goals and agendas blame others , mr childress said , referring to mr difrancesco campaign officials for james e mcgreevey , the democratic gubernatorial candidate , who withdrew his support for the arena last week , did not return calls chuck leitgeb , a spokesman for the assembly republicans , said he did not believe that mr difrancesco was implying any racism on the part of legislators , whom he said have steadily increased newark s municipal and school aid in recent years i really ca n't say what he meant , said mr leitgeb , who did not rule out the possibility that racism had played some role , among someone , in thwarting the arena no doubt there may be some people out there who feel that way , and that would be sad
the mohair goat subsidy is back you 're kidding me , said leon panetta , who was budget director when the goats lost their halfcenturyold federal safety net during the clinton administration i thought we 'd driven a stake through its heart , but evidently someone buried it in the basement in the dirt , said senator john kerry of massachusetts , pursuing the vampire metaphor a little further than absolutely necessary this is an excellent cautionary tale for a new administration that s currently hammering out its very first budget to hear the budget director , mitch daniels , describe it , this is going to be a painless process , with the only real cuts taking place within a pile of deadwood so moribund it s positively fossilized we did find a few programs that had run their due course , he said the other day some of them , i'm happy to say , succeeded in their mission and therefore need not be renewed this sounds very clever , but it overlooks the fact that every government initiative , no matter how ridiculous or pathetic , has a legislator who loves it it takes an enormous amount of time , and energy , to eliminate anything i remember mario cuomo once claiming it took him 15 years to get rid of a new york institution called the division of servicemen s voting , which consisted of a single secretary who sat at a desk duplicating the work of the state board of elections the clinton administration tried to cancel highway programs that were financed at the whim of various legislators without ever having been put on the transportation priority list they overlooked the fact that the chairman of the appropriations committee , senator robert byrd , regarded this practice as the whole point of existence the senator went through the roof , and we decided we could n't do it , said mr panetta the bush team is eyeing those very highways , but we do n't want to suggest the same thing will happen to them after all , mr byrd is no longer in power the current chairman , senator ted stevens of alaska , is probably totally indifferent to porkbarrel projects and then there is the mohair goat story once upon a time , there were three government subsidies the mohair subsidy , the wool subsidy and the honeybee subsidy none of them were particularly expensive , as subsidies go but they became the stuff of legend because they were so utterly , completely outdated they were the product of the world war ii era , when the military needed wool to make lots of uniforms and beeswax for waterproofing nobody seems to know how mohair got in the mix it was being used to make upholstered furniture , which did not actually play a major part in the war effort but while our soldiers were making the world safe for democracy , our legislators decided to make it safe for angora goat herders by 1960 , the world had synthetic fibers , and the military had no further need for wool or beeswax , let alone mohair but the subsidies were still there in 1993 , when the clinton administration decided getting rid of them would be part of reinventing government they ran into a bipartisan cast of opponents , most of them from texas , a place that produces a lot of mohair senator phil gramm , ever the fiscal conservative when it comes to all spending directed at the other 49 states , rallied to the cause so did representative charles stenholm , the leader of the tightfisted blue dog democrats representative lamar smith took extreme umbrage when people suggested that there was no point in subsidizing a product that nobody seemed to want mohair is popular ! i have a mohair sweater ! it s my favorite one ! he cried it was a long and bitter battle , but eventually the subsidies were phased out they lay dormant for a couple of years then they started creeping back last year congress appropriated 20 million to give the goat and sheep herders a 40cent stipend for each pound of mohair and wool they produced the wool and mohair loss assistance program will help get this important industry back on its feet , said representative henry bonilla of texas meanwhile , the honeybees are in the process of being propped up with a brandnew set of price supports there 'll be no beeswax shortage on this congress s watch and we 've protected the national stockpile of overstuffed sofas
brussels , aug 21 nato ministers gave the goahead today to send a full 3 , 500soldier task force into macedonia to help disarm albanian insurgents after nato s top military commander recommended the deployment , saying the ceasefire was generally holding the decision will go into effect automatically on wednesday if none of nato s 19 member nations object before midday barring lastminute changes , we 're in business , a nato spokesman said if today s decision proceeds , it is expected to take 10 to 14 days to move about 3 , 100 more soldiers into the country a headquarters unit of about 400 british and czech soldiers entered during the weekend nato authorized their rapid deployment last week to encourage both sides to stick with the ceasefire the 19 nato members were given a day to object because some countries have laws requiring consultations with cabinets or parliaments before their troops are sent on new missions abroad even though it s a decision everyone s expected , said a western diplomat here , no ambassador would want his capital to make a decision without a chance to digest the latest advice before giving a final nod forward the spokesman declined to say which nations needed more time , but the germans and dutch have laws requiring consultations germany is contributing 500 troops to the mission , to be led by the british and their 16th air assault brigade the mission will also include 300 american troops who specialize in communications , satellite intelligence , military transportation and medicine about 500 americans are already stationed in macedonia as part of the mission to neighboring kosovo that began in 1999 maj randy martin , an american spokesman in kosovo , said an undetermined number of those troops would also take part in the nato mission but american soldiers will not take part in taking weapons from the rebels , officials said the rest of the troops for the nato mission will be provided by the czech republic , france , germany , greece , hungary , italy , the netherlands , norway , spain and turkey the nato ministers made their decision today after an assessment by gen joseph w ralston , commander of nato forces in europe , who was in macedonia on monday the fighting , of course , has not stopped sniper and mortar fire were exchanged in the village of neprosteno , near tetovo , while general ralston was in the country on monday , and today an explosion ripped apart a 14thcentury monastery , one of the most revered orthodox buildings in macedonia still , general ralston apparently emphasized that the danger of waiting , and perhaps seeing the ceasefire unravel , was greater than the danger to nato troops of going in immediately the mission is authorized to last one month from the date all the troops are deployed , and their mission is limited to accepting and destroying weapons voluntarily turned in nato countries are eager to avoid another openended , expensive peacekeeping mission like those in kosovo and bosnia , and they say there are no plans to extend this one but military analysts have already begun to question whether it will be possible to determine if the rebels have disarmed in 30 days and suggest that the fighting that began in february could easily resume after nato troops leave nato steps gingerly over this issue while conceding that the number of weapons to be collected estimates vary from 2 , 500 to 6 , 000 or more is important , the spokesman insisted that the mission is primarily a confidencebuilding gesture the guerrillas have agreed to disarm in stages at the same time as the government passes reforms giving albanians greater rights under the peace deal signed last week , president boris trajkovski is to ask the macedonian parliament to amend the preamble of the constitution so that it no longer implies that the macedonian slavs have preeminent status legal changes are to make albanian an official language wherever albanians are more than 20 percent of the population the national police force is to recruit 1 , 000 albanian officers , and an albanianlanguage university is to receive state support parliament has 45 days to pass the reforms , and nato hopes each step will encourage the rebels to turn in more guns , which would further encourage parliament mines are already being cleared from some roads , which is necessary for the nato troops to cross back and forth between the lines unarmed liaison teams from the british headquarters unit have already begun meeting with the rebels one team , accompanied by a group of british journalists , was met with tea and spinach pastries although cordial , the unit remained suspicious it turned back macedonian journalists and interpreters at the edge of the village
news of katie couric s huge new salary was met with proclamations from some agents that it would set new pay standards for the television news industry at large but news executives trying to shave costs in the dry advertising climate said they generally would and probably could hold the line the reported yearly salary of 15 million to 16 million for ms couric the coanchor of nbc s today show seemed to give her the top salary in television news some agents for other television news anchors said they certainly planned on using the salary to their advantage in the coming months i think what any agent does is attempt to maximize the earnings of the client , and we use many criteria to establish that , said wayne s kabak , a senior vice president of the william morris agency who represents authors and television anchors , including maria bartiromo of cnbc and lou dobbs of cnn but among the foremost of those criteria is what the marketplace will bear this , he added , is one more guidepost mr kabak is part of a relatively small group of news agents and representatives who can command up to 10 percent of their clients' earnings and who stand to gain greatly should ms couric s deal raise the ceiling on anchor salaries these agents and representatives include richard leibner and carole cooper of n s bienstock \( representing diane sawyer of abc , dan rather of cbs , and aaron brown of cnn \) robert barnett \( who has represented sam donaldson of abc , andrea mitchell of nbc and christiane amanpour of cnn \) and ed hookstratten \( bryant gumbel of cbs and tom brokaw of nbc \) for their part , news executives said privately that there were only a select few who would be able to use ms couric s salary as an advantage in their own negotiations and many of those in a position to ask for a raise are making so much already that it is unrealistic to think they could make much more , and none are anywhere near being in the unique position held by ms couric , they said today is in a class by itself at three hours a day for five days a week , it is on air longer than any other daily news program on broadcast television it is easily no 1 in its time period it is not only the most profitable program in news , it is often the most profitable program in all of television you can never make broad assumptions based on one person s circumstances , said steve friedman , executive producer of the early show on cbs and former executive producer of today the 'today' show is 50 years old , it is one of the crown jewels of nbc this is n't just about money , it s about protecting one of your crown jewels with one of your major talents michael glantz , an agent at sfx representing willow bay of cnn and claire shipman of abc , agreed with mr friedman i think this moves things higher if you anchor a show that is no 1 for as long as the 'today' show has been and have the staying power of katie couric still , the model will be tested in the next year or so , with contracts coming up for renewal for several of the most established anchors exact salary figures are hard to come by , but peter jennings of abc news is said to make more than 10 million a year , tom brokaw of nbc is said to have a base salary of about 8 million , and bryant gumbel of cbs is said to have a base salary of about 6 million but while mr brokaw and mr jennings are considered the lead anchors of their networks because they appear on the flagship evening newscasts , their programs are not exactly huge profit generators and though mr gumbel , coanchor of the early show on cbs , has helped contribute to a rise in ratings among younger viewers coveted by advertisers , his program remains well behind the secondplace morning program , good morning america , on abc several top anchors have longterm contracts that do not come up for renewal for some time , including ted koppel , who is estimated to earn slightly less than 8 million a year barbara walters , who is said to make more than 10 million and ms sawyer , who is said to be close behind her tom wolzien , a media analyst at sanford c bernstein , said mr couric s new contract could have an unanticipated effect on the market for television news people with ms couric agreeing to continue at today for years to come , other anchors , who could have entered talks for her job , cannot now use it to drive their current salaries up on one hand , it may raise the bar , but on the other hand it reduces the demand for talent , he said it could make everybody else worth less because there s one job that s taken out of the mix but , he added , the burden now falls to nbc to keep its other talent costs down and , several agents said , ms couric s coanchor , matt lauer , may now be in a position to ask for a much higher salary than his current one , estimated to be worth at least 4 million a year the agent for mr lauer , ken lindner , had no comment
moscow , nov 29 a moscow court decided this week to dissolve russia s last independent national television network , leading to an outcry by journalists and human rights leaders who say the decision leaves russians with little choice of news the network , tv6 , belongs to boris a berezovsky , the selfexiled businessman , and lukoil , a russian oil company lukoil filed court documents this summer claiming that the network was in financial trouble and should be put out of business but the network , home to the journalists who resigned from the embattled station of the media tycoon vladimir v gusinsky , says business is booming and the real source of the suit is a manipulative kremlin tv6 is preparing an appeal one thing is clear if the court rejects the appeal , one result will be virtual government control over national television that is what many here say they want to prevent on wednesday the union of russian journalists called on colleagues and viewers to oppose the decision , calling it an abuse of the wellknown weakness of the russian court system and its subservience to outside pressure of course this is political , said lyudmila alekseyeva , president of the moscow helsinki group our authorities remember financial errors only of those they want to catch they took good television away from us it just does n't exist the decision , issued monday , evoked the long battle over mr gusinsky s ntv channel , in which the statecontrolled gas company gazprom took over ntv both companies are being tried under a law that experts here say is antiquated and rarely used this law was invoked only one other time , against mr gusinsky s media company , said anya kachkaeva , a professor of journalism at moscow state university if it was applied universally , many companies would be liquidated that brings in politics why are n't they doing this to others \? why is there always a double standard \? there are differences since coming to tv6 from mr gusinsky s channel in the spring , the journalists have doubled the network s rating , though the gains were mostly limited to the moscow area advertising has increased and tv6 much less in debt than mr gusinsky s network was says it is now breaking even mr gusinsky was known for his heavy hand in editorial policy , while tv6 journalists say they do not feel constrained in the same way it s outrageous , said alim yusupov , a former ntv correspondent who now works for tv6 with gusinsky maybe there was some grounds for discussion how did he get the loans \? how legal were his actions \? but with tv6 the hidden motive is obvious we had just started gaining popularity we even surprised ourselves , and now they are trying to liquidate the company despite talk of the network s fate among journalists , most russians care little about what happens to the station exhausted from a decade of changing governments and political intrigues , people will not be willing to take action to protect the station , experts say rallies to protest the takeover of mr gusinsky s channel came to nothing if you had meetings to support ntv , there will be none for tv6 , said floriana fossato , a moscowbased russian media analyst half of its audience is confused and afraid of what russia might become , but the other half just wants some peace
washington , feb 9 stephon marbury s eyes flashed complete surprise and the words spilled from his smile thank you ! thank you ! thank you , god ! marbury yelled into the cell phone i ca n't believe it ! thank you ! the bearer of this good news , the best of the nets' season , was the team s president , rod thorn , who found the childlike joy of his franchise player refreshing during allstar weekend , when some of the participants have been less than enthusiastic in their commitment to the game , perhaps no player appreciates this experience more than marbury , the player from coney island who has taken a circuitous route to adulthood he departed from newark this morning on a firstclass train and for an hour ran through the cars snapping photos of passengers , shaking hands , making friends this afternoon , he bounced into the ballroom of the grand hyatt in the nation s capital wearing a sparkling necklace and a megawatt grin to match i'm here ! he announced , after climbing on his chair in front of his sparsely populated media table he stretched out his arms and yelled to anyone not already crowding his neighbors , latrell sprewell and chris webber , come over here ! here , in his own corner , was a marker of how far he had come , and how much further he has still to go to find maturity , and victory my sister said that maybe it was meant to be this way , that maybe i was n't supposed to make it before , said marbury , who will play in his first allstar game in five pro seasons she said , 'you might have gotten lazy you might have been satisfied two , three years ago' what it did was , it made me hungrier , it made me love the game more last season , when the nets were spiraling downward in despair and eastern conference coaches excluded him as an allstar reserve despite his 22 points and 8 assists a game , marbury used the snub as motivation to work harder marbury spent the summer lifting weights , playing in harlem s rucker league and studying the encyclopedic playbook of nets coach byron scott with prodding from scott , who has become his mentor , marbury has done more than develop his mind or the rippled muscles on his 6foot2 , 180pound frame he has consciously worked to mature into a leader marbury has tried to reform his image as an impatient point guard reluctant to trust his teammates through everything that happened last year , i learned a lesson , he said in a recent interview the lesson was , it s not easy to be a leader , it s not easy to go out every night and play at a high level it s hard in order to maintain a certain focus , you have to have your teammates behind you , no matter what even if they do n't like you , you got to make them like you you got to make them want to follow you and do the things you need them to do to win the game , build confidence in them , make them believe that they can do certain things when the nets lost 10 of their first 11 games last season , marbury was doing most of the shooting he felt the criticism from his teammates i knew everything i was doing was in good intentions , he said i knew there were times we were losing and i did try to do too much because i felt we were n't getting things going but i did n't go out every night and play as hard as i could just because i wanted to do it for stephon i wanted to do it because i wanted to win i 've never been in a situation where i 've lost , so it was different it was something i had to adjust to it was n't an easy adjustment it still is n't the nets are 1734 , bedeviled by the same injury trouble that hurt them last season marbury has taken comfort in his belief that things happen for a reason , that adversity will help him mature he started to adjust his body language , his coaches and teammates said , and cut down on the brooding and rolled eyes scott instructs him to be like his former teammate and marbury s idol , magic johnson magic never felt like he was above anybody , that his teammates could n't tell him when he did something wrong , and steph has to get to that same level , scott said , then smiled you know , sometimes we forget , he s just 23 marbury has rallied his teammates around him recently in lastminute victories over philadelphia and san antonio and has left them awestruck with his midair feats but he has earned their respect with his work ethic even after playing 40 minutes in a game , they see how he brings the same intensity to practice the next day but despite averaging a careerhigh 24 points and 68 assists , and shooting a teambest 447 percent this season , marbury was skeptical of his allstar chances and had made plans to go to the bahamas this weekend marbury got the allstar call on the team bus going to the arena in vancouver , british columbia , where the nets , five hours later , lost their fifth straight game his selection as an allstar , scott said , has not only established marbury as an elite player , but has also enabled him to deal with our season so far marbury was not prepared for losing when he came to new jersey in march 1999 he had asked his agent at the time , david falk , to help get him traded back home
algiers , dec 8 with the end of ramadan approaching , the narrow alleyways of the casbah bustle with shoppers looking for new clothes , which muslims traditionally wear to mark the end of the holy month at times , the ancient cobblestone streets here are so full , it is hard to move the stores and stalls bulge with cheap goods outside the old neighborhood , many women dress as they would in any european city most do not wear head scarves it is rare to see young women hiding their faces the days when islamic guerrillas used the casbah as a base for bombings , ambushes and assassinations are over for the owner of the aziza toy store , who even has computer games displayed in the window , life has changed considerably in 1995 , i saw a policeman gunned down right there , he says , pointing to the sidewalk in front of his shop there was so much fear today i can stay open until midnight , no problem there is crime , yes , but that is it algeria is emerging from a savage war between its military rulers and islamic guerrilla groups , who singled out journalists and intellectuals and butchered entire villages where once thousands died each month , now the figure is less than a hundred , experts believe , and even that may be inflated by the inclusion of ordinary criminal attacks most of the guerrilla violence is in the countryside president abdelaziz bouteflika has talked of vast economic reforms and worked hard to improve algeria s image , with some success he has twice been received this year by president bush and was among the first muslim leaders to offer help in the war against terrorism but for many algerians , great uncertainty still prevails after two years in power for mr bouteflika , little has come of his promises and many wonder whether their oilrich country is on the road to an open democracy or whether it is destined to continue in the hands of a group of generals , known here as le pouvoir the power most everything about the algerian government remains murky no one is quite certain how much freedom the president has to institute change foreign journalists cannot leave their hotels without government bodyguards , ostensibly for safety reasons but the guards' presence also keeps algerian authorities informed about who is being interviewed during a walk through the casbah with five government guards , no one including the toy store owner wanted to be identified some foreign investors are returning but misery continues to grip this country around the city beggars abound and some eke out a living selling cigarettes one at a time children in rags kick balls of newspaper around in the mud unemployment is estimated at 30 to 50 percent nearly everyone grumbles about corruption and government inefficiency the terrorism postponed looking at many of the problems here , said r da bekkat , the managing editor of el wata , an algerian daily newspaper before it was about survival today , people are asking for a life and on that scale , we see little improvement since taking office , mr bouteflika has worked hard to end the isolation algeria suffered when , facing a likely victory by muslim fundamentalists , the military canceled the 1992 elections guerrillas responded at first with attacks on the army and the police but they soon targeted journalists and intellectuals and began slaughtering whole villages even many critics of the government believe that the military takeover was a good thing , saving algeria from going the way of afghanistan algerians have for years talked of al qaeda and foreign funding to islamic guerrillas bin laden is not a new name here , said maloud brahimi , former head of algeria s league of human rights but mr brahimi , like many other algerian intellectuals , is not sure whether algeria s new friendship with the west will be a good thing economically , he said , algeria needs a jumpstart but he hopes the west will continue to press algeria for free and fair elections others too are concerned that the west eager for friends in muslim countries will overlook human rights abuses here mahmoud khelili , a human rights lawyer , says that more than 7 , 000 people have disappeared in the last decade and that the government itself was responsible for some perhaps many of the killings attributed to the guerrillas such removals have stopped , mr khelili said but other abuses continue one of his clients , he says , has been chained to a wall in an algerian prison for more than two years one client , recently extradited from france , disappeared for 10 days before mr khelili found him in a prison he has yet to be able to meet with him bouteflika has n't fixed anything , mr khelili said justice , corruption , education it has not been fixed i do n't see the day yet when you can just buy medicine here and not have a friend sneak it into the country for you mr bouteflika has talked of privatizing government industries and restructuring government ministries but his most ambitious move was an amnesty plan for disarming islamic militants some groups went along but not all , and critics complain that the promised allout military offensive against those that did not has not been forthcoming the terror attacks have diminished , but they do continue
washington , june 21 senate democrats sharply questioned secretary of defense donald h rumsfeld today about the high cost and unproven effectiveness of a national missile defense system , and they raised deep concerns about the administration s threats to withdraw from the 1972 antiballistic missile treaty if the russians refused to amend it during his first hearing before the senate armed services committee since his confirmation , mr rumsfeld met a surprisingly unified skepticism from liberal and centrist democrats regarding missile defense , signaling the difficulties president bush is likely to face when he tries to sell a plan to congress later this year in one exchange , senator max cleland , democrat of georgia , questioned mr rumsfeld s suggestion that the pentagon would consider deploying an antimissile system before it had finished testing if the threat of an attack seemed imminent noting that the pentagon had failed in several recent tests to shoot down ballistic missiles , mr cleland said , i have serious doubts and reservations that the issue of national missile defense has been given too great a priority in your calculations national missile defense is an uncertain trumpet at this point , he continued , and we ought not to blow it before we test it and fully make sure it is deployable it does n't make sense to deploy this system without that guarantee later , senator bill nelson , democrat of florida , repeatedly asked mr rumsfeld to explain which upcoming tests on antimissile technology would violate the abm treaty president bush has asserted that the treaty must be amended or abrogated to allow testing of promising technologies which allow antimissile weapons to be fired from ships , planes and possibly space vehicles but mr rumsfeld said he was not sure which tests might violate the treaty he added that he wanted to be able to tell the russians , come on , we 've got to test , and we do n't want to have someone accuse us of breaking the treaty let s not get into a legal , lawyer s argument over the thing clearly unmoved , mr nelson replied we need , for the sake of the defense of the country , to proceed with robust research and development , but you ca n't deploy something that s not developed and so all of the wringing of hands of the abrogation of the treaty seems to me to be a little premature before something has been developed mr rumsfeld , who also appeared before the house armed services committee later in the day , had come to capitol hill to discuss his efforts to redesign the national military strategy , the first step toward buying new hightech weapons and restructuring the forces for postcoldwar threats the secretary said the united states faced greater threats than at any other time since the collapse of the soviet union he also noted that since the signing of the abm treaty , which prohibits the development and deployment of systems that could defend the united states against longrange ballistic missiles , the number of countries with nuclear weapons programs has more than doubled , to 12 , and the number of countries with ballistic missiles has more than tripled , to 28 this presents a very different challenge from that of the cold war , mr rumsfeld said in his testimony even in the old soviet union , the secretary general of the communist party , dictator though he was , had a politburo to provide some checks and balances that might have kept him from using those weapons at his whim what checks and balances are there on saddam hussein or kim jong il \? he asked , suggesting that the threat of retaliation would not deter unpredictable autocrats from using nuclear weapons none that we know of or can influence but his warnings did not appear to sway democrats on the panel senator jack reed , democrat of rhode island , said , we are basing some significant policy judgments on behavioral perceptions of regimes , and i think we have to do a little bit more work on sharpening those behavioral perceptions senator ben nelson , democrat of nebraska , asked mr rumsfeld whether the pentagon had a formula for deciding when the effectiveness of a new weapons system justified its high cost mr rumsfeld said no well , mr nelson replied , i 'd be very concerned if it was about 10 percent successful and we were looking at spending hundreds of billions of dollars that would then be taken away from other priorities within the defense department it s very difficult to argue against saving one city but we ca n't save one city with something that then makes us more vulnerable in other areas that are more likely to be open to attack in another sharp exchange , senator carl levin , a democrat from michigan who is chairman of the committee , said he was concerned that withdrawing from the abm treaty might cause the russians to increase the size of their nuclear arsenal , including putting additional warheads on their missiles president vladimir v putin of russia said this week that his country would make such an upgrade if the united states proceeded on its own to construct a missile shield would you agree it s possible , at least , that they could respond in a way to a unilateral withdrawal which would not be in our interest , that would make us less secure \? mr levin asked mr rumsfeld said it was possible but he added , we 're not hostile states they are going to be reducing their nuclear weapons regardless of what we do we 're going to be reducing our nuclear weapons to some level , regardless of what they do at the end of the hearing , mr levin playfully warned mr rumsfeld that the democrats would try to shift money in president bush s defense budget away from missile defense and toward better benefits for military personnel some republicans on the committee defended the administration s missile defense program we have made extraordinary progress , said senator jeff sessions , republican of alabama a particularly heated moment came when senator susan collins , republican of maine , told mr rumsfeld that the pentagon was sending confusing signals about shipbuilding , an important industry for her state sounding irritated by the question , mr rumsfeld said with respect to the chaos you characterize , there is none any time that anyone asks a question , it s going to make people nervous photo defense secretary donald h rumsfeld testified before a senate committee yesterday about the proposed antimissile system \( david scull for the new york times \)
warsaw , may 15 on a hard wooden bench , in a dusty courtroom on a street named for the people who cast him from power , gen wojciech jaruzelski , former martial law ruler of communist poland , sat proud and erect today , facing a tribunal prosecuting him on charges of manslaughter for the shooting of striking workers 31 years ago general jaruzelski , now 78 and in frail health , was defense minister in december 1970 when troops shot demonstrating workers in the baltic port cities of gdansk , gdynia and szczecin several days of rioting over price increases and food shortages left 44 workers dead , 1 , 200 injured and more than 300 in jail according to prosecutors , the general gave orders to shoot his lawyers call the charges legal nonsense and say lowlevel subordinates gave the orders to shoot the case against the general began in 1996 , and has been repeatedly delayed , first by his poor health , then by his effort to have it moved from a criminal court to an administrative tribunal today , after nearly six hours of wrangling in the courthouse that sits on the avenue named after the solidarity trade union , the general and the eight other men on trial all former senior military , police or communist party officials were ordered to return on thursday the general has repeatedly asserted his innocence in the 1970 deaths , which helped give birth a decade later to the solidarity trade union led by lech walesa general jaruzelski is willing , he has said , to stand trial for imposing martial law in poland on dec 13 , 1981 , a move he defends as the only way to save poland from a soviet invasion to crush solidarity and its challenge to communist power in many ways , it is not the general and his codefendants or even the communist past on trial , but the politics of poland today the country faces parliamentary elections this fall , in which a resurgent leftist group of reformed communists and younger social democrats appears ready to regain power from a rightwing anticommunist coalition led by the remnants of the solidarity labor union andrezej wroblewski , a commentator for the weekly polityka , said the rightists want to use the trial to discredit the communists and more centrist politicians who joined general jaruzelski in 1989 in a round table that eventually led the communists to cede power peacefully to solidarity a purely political struggle to try jaruzelski is dressed in legal arguments , mr wroblewski said in an interview people think politics but they say law krzysztof leski , a former solidarity activist who is now a radio journalist , said each and every trial of this kind in each and every country that overthrew a dictator is a political trial but people have died , and someone or some institution should be held responsible that was not necessarily the view of elderly former soldiers who vocally defended general jaruzelski today outside the courtroom he saved poland from a bloody cataclysm that could have ended worse for everyone , said a retired general , henryk adamowicz , now 82 one of general jaruzelski s codefendants , a retired army general named tadeusz tuczapski , 79 , said the charges were absurd , because none of the men on trial gave direct orders to shoot a trial is needed to show how the army really behaved , but now it is just intended to discredit communism , general tuczapski said
london , aug 8 dismissing employees and selling subsidiaries as it runs out of money , globalnet financialcom looks like another internet venture going bust in a hurry but instead of quietly closing shop , the company is the center of a takeover battle for stakes it owns in a few promising businesses , including a broker of shares in initial public offerings and an online seller of personal pensions , life insurance and other financial services the tussle is a cautionary tale of the consequences of freewheeling spending sanctioned by the internet boom at issue is whether globalnet , which is based in santa monica , calif , but does most of its business in britain , suffered from mistakes or malfeasance did the executives make some bad investments , spending 120 million on deals that generated little return , or did they breach their fiduciary responsibility to shareholders through a series of insider transactions \? arguing the latter , a group of angry shareholders are trying to oust management by backing a takeover bid by aisoftware , a software company based in italy aisoftware today made an unsolicited offer of 137 million in stock for globalnet globalnet managers , who deny any wrongdoing and say they have consistently acted in the best interest of the company , said they supported an earlier 9 million cash takeover offer from newmedia spark , a british company that invests in startups the companies have shared some directors , have some joint investments and have offices in the same building in london ron goldie , globalnet s chief operating officer , said today that the board backed newmedia s bid as the only tangible offer on the table michael whitaker , newmedia s chief executive and until recently a globalnet board member , said the close relationship of the two companies could benefit globalnet s shareholders because newmedia spark has a number of investments in common with globalnet , we are better placed than anyone else to realize value from those assets , he said investors must decide by aug 22 whether to sell their shares to newmedia as the debate intensifies , dissident shareholders are questioning some recent deals , like one in which globalnet sold ukinvest , its flagship financial web site , to advanced financial network for 800 , 000 , or 11 million , in stock as part of the deal , globalnet agreed to invest 700 , 000 in advanced financial , in which newmedia spark also owns some shares one of the dissident shareholders , peter fuhrman of new york , says that globalnet is spending its precious cash to prop up newmedia s portfolio mr goldie defended the agreement with advanced financial by saying that the only way globalnet can sell assets in such a competitive market is to contribute its own money to the deal the takeover debate comes amid a simmering battle over earlier management decisions made after the internet bubble burst last year and while globalnet s share value plunged more than 90 percent dissident shareholders , for example , have challenged globalnet s decision to pay 19 million in severance to three top executives , even though its remaining cash reserve of 3 million is not enough to keep operations afloat or to cover liquidation costs they also wonder why executives adopted a poison pill a decision to issue new shares to dilute the stake of an unwanted suitor if they are truly interested in selling the company to the highest bidder roger alford , a senior research associate in the financial markets group of the london school of economics , said poison pills protected management at the expense of shareholders it gives them a trump card , he said , by allowing management to negotiate not necessarily with the highest bidder , but with one who promises to safeguard their jobs or pay severance packages mr goldie said the company was legally obligated to pay severance to him and two other executives when they were dismissed last week none of the executives was expected to remain with the company under its new owner if a buyer is not found , he said , they will be dismissed regardless because globalnet will have ceased operating he said the poison pill was designed to ensure that potential suitors negotiate with globalnet s board globalnet started as a brokerage firm in 1987 , under the name galt financial a little over a decade later , it began providing financial services on the internet , and by 1999 had changed its name to globalnet financialcom , under the direction of stanley hollander , then chief executive globalnet raced to build web sites that delivered financial news , operated chat rooms and allowed subscribers to buy and sell stocks under the names ukinvest and americainvest , among others it also invested in a variety of unrelated companies , including 11 million in newmedia spark mr whitaker , newmedia s chief executive , joined the globalnet board in november 1999 , though he resigned before starting his bid the two companies have offices in the same building off regent street in london globalnet , whose shares already traded on nasdaq , raised 78 million by selling more shares on the alternative investment market in london at the end of 1999 some of the shares came from executives and investors in the company , who pocketed 163 million the rest of the money was used to expand the business critics like mr fuhrman complain that the money was wasted on a series of imprudent investments , including leasing office space the company never occupied and buying a brokerage firm that closed a year later mr hollander , who resigned as chief executive last september but is still a board member , said the deals appeared to be a sensible strategic investment in the context of financial markets then existing while 2000 started well for globalnet , by the end of the year the company would lose 744 million on revenue of 73 million among the reasons for the loss globalnet leased space in manhattan for an internet foreign exchange operation that never happened the space remains unoccupied , and globalnet is negotiating to get out of 17 million in lease obligations , company documents show globalnet also agreed to buy dalton kent , a manhattan brokerage firm , for 20 million in stock just before financial markets tumbled what had been a profitable business began hemorrhaging 460 , 000 a month globalnet closed the operation less than a year later , recovering almost nothing from the investment , but not before it paid the former dalton kent partners a further 35 million in cash plus 11 million more globalnet shares to compensate for a steep decline in its own stock price compounding its problems , globalnet had expanded dalton kent s operations to florida in the months after the acquisition , signing a 32 million lease for office space now a globalnet vice president and director , alan jacobs , is negotiating to buy the florida assets from globalnet for an undisclosed price mr fuhrman said he would prefer to see those assets sold to people unrelated to the company mr goldie said extensive attempts to sublet the office space had proved fruitless in a market with collapsing real estate prices he said mr jacobs s offer was the only serious one
it might seem anticlimactic after a fevered rivalry with the staten island yankees ended saturday night with the brooklyn cyclones winning the twoofthreegame playoff series , but the cyclones still have some games to play to win a championship ring brooklyn , winner of the new yorkpenn league s mcnamara division , will meet williamsport in the championship series beginning today on the road the cyclones will then play host to game 2 and , if necessary , game 3 of the twoofthreegame finals at keyspan park on wednesday and thursday after losing the opening game of the playoffs against staten island , 61 , the cyclones won the series by relying on the pitching that has carried them throughout the season in game 2 , michael cox overcame a shaky start and teamed with reliever harold eckert to silence the yankee bats in an 84 victory in game 3 , the cyclones ace ross peeples lived up to his billing by limiting staten island to four hits in seven innings in a 41 victory cyclones manager edgar alfonzo will have some decisions to make regarding his deep pitching staff none of the starters from the yankees series will have been rested enough to take the mound for game 1 , although eckert said he could be ready for game 1 despite four innings of relief friday steve popper
goshen , ny , jan 25 there were the dogs , for example for a while , officers were using german shepherds in the county jail , which was unorthodox as well as unfortunate for the inmates being bitten there were also the incidents of sheriff s deputies straying from their appointed duties , including one who ran off to mexico with 130 , 000 in bail money but what finally pushed the orange county executive , joseph g rampe , into action were the accusations in a lawsuit filed by the state attorney general last september it alleged that deputy sheriffs had pocketed proceeds from bogus raffles , kept scant accounting records for the two nonprofit foundations they ran , and enlisted reserve volunteers to steal cameras and clothing from a walmart all on the pretense of benefiting the orange county sheriff s department the lawsuit which seeks fines as well as the recouping of about 117 , 000 in missing money also alleged that sheriff h frank bigger , the county s top elected law enforcement official , either knew or should have known about the abuses it charges that he ignored repeated complaints about the key player in the purported embezzlement a close adviser and parttime deputy sheriff whose passion for flashing lights , guns and other police accouterments kept getting him in trouble to tell you that all of it did n't have an influence on me would n't be telling the truth , mr rampe said , his tone betraying the strains of understatement ever so gently , mr rampe challenged the power structure by dedicating 150 , 000 in this year s budget to study the role of sheriff in an oldstyle rural county that is evolving into a bedroom community to new york city maybe the study will suggest that a little tinkering is needed , or maybe that the sheriff s office be abolished either way , mr rampe said , the time has come to take a good hard look sheriff bigger , whose surname reflects his perceived stature in the community , has denied any wrongdoing , and has suggested that the sudden interest of eliot l spitzer , the attorney general and a democrat , in a republican bastion , orange county , is purely political but he has also agreed to cooperate with the county s study , some say through gritted teeth whatever the study leads to , it presents a threat to an office that in much of new york state is part exalted position and part throwback to the days of english settlers peter kehoe , the executive director of the new york sheriff s association , said that the sheriffs of new york whose duties vary from county to county investigate most of the felony crimes in upstate , but often find themselves trying to escape unflattering stereotypes westchester county did away with its sheriff s department 20 years ago , and other counties , including putnam , are considering it the given reasons range from desires for greater efficiency to concerns about improper behavior but mr kehoe said he attributed the trend to powerhungry county leaders every county executive i ever met wanted to be his own little general , he said , with their own little police department to protect those they favor and go after those they do n't also not helping sheriff bigger is the sudden scrutiny of orange county law enforcement earlier this month , mr spitzer requested a federal monitor for the wallkill police department , whose members are accused of pulling over female drivers to solicit dates , stalking and harassing critics , and generally behaving as though the law were a concept foreign to them sheriff bigger , 69 , is a classic new york state sheriff , a veteran of the korean war , a retired state trooper , larger than life and always present at barbecue benefits to share a laugh except with reporters , whom he generally shuns he is his own man , in the truest sense , with little legislative and executive meddling into a fief that includes a new 90 million jail , a 31 million budget , and a staff of 300 deputies and correction officers that is about to grow by another 67 employees the sheriff s autonomy created occasional tension with mr rampe and the county legislature , although they had no desire to fight with a likable sheriff still , they did not enjoy finding out about the dogbitesinmate incidents through a federal lawsuit , or reading critical stories in the times heraldrecord of middletown , including the one about his office s giving supporters dashboard permits that said their cars were on official police business then , last september , the attorney general filed a lawsuit that said a piece of the bigger lawenforcement domain had crossed the line of legality thanks in part to the faith he had put in a man named harry ryttenberg mr ryttenberg has alternated between working as an assignment editor for local television stations he now works for wwortv , channel 9 , and as a spokesman for public agencies he is also a law enforcement buff who , in 1991 , joined the orange county sheriff s department as a parttime , unpaid officer who happened to live in westchester county
washington , nov 9 postal investigators said today for the first time that other mail containing anthrax bacteria was probably sent here last month in addition to the one letter that has been found , the one sent to the office of senator tom daschle of south dakota we 're thinking there may be one more letter and maybe more than one , said kenneth newman , the deputy chief postal inspector for investigations the basis for this view , said john nolan , the deputy postmaster general , is that experts at the centers for disease control and prevention say it is unlikely that the mail handler at a state department postal center in virginia who contracted inhalation anthrax could have been infected by a letter that had merely come in contact with the one to mr daschle tom ridge , director of homeland security , said today that with no new anthrax infections in more than a week , the threat seemed to be subsiding but mr ridge added that the authorities were still no closer to identifying specifically the origin of the anthrax or the perpetrators an fbi analyst said investigators were leaning toward the theory that one domestic terrorist was behind the anthrax attacks the analyst said the deadly microbes could have been manufactured for as little as 2 , 500 based on the evidence already collected , the bureau also released a personality profile of the person who sent the letters in new jersey , the authorities announced that tiny amounts of anthrax had been found in four small post offices that had served as feeder offices for the hamilton township center that processed at least three anthraxlaced letters in september and early october none of the four offices were ordered closed , and officials said they thought the contamination resulted from crosscontaminated mail that had traveled between the offices and the hamilton center in tracking the infections , the disease control centers concluded two weeks ago that there were more letters than those already found the director of the centers , dr jeffrey p koplan , said on oct 26 that contamination of the state department worker by the letter to mr daschle would be highly unlikely to virtually impossible if there is more contaminated mail , it is probably in the tons of unsorted letters and packages impounded after the discovery of the letter to mr daschle the mail was quarantined on capitol hill , at the state department mail center , at some other government departments and agencies , and at the brentwood post office , the main mail processing center for the washington area searching the mountains of impounded mail will be a monumental task more than 50 trailers of mail from the brentwood station , perhaps a million letters and packages , have been trucked to ohio for irradiation to kill anthrax microbes , the postal authorities said about 300 sealed drums of mail from capitol hill have been sent to a warehouse in virginia at the state department , all the mail since oct 24 has been held , and embassies overseas have been ordered to seal and return to washington all mail sent in diplomatic pouches from here after oct 11 investigators will not have access to any of this mail until it has been sterilized frederick jones , a department spokesman , said no decision had yet been made about what decontamination process to use eventually , said mr newman , the deputy chief postal inspector , we do intend very carefully to go through all the mail that has been held to search for other letters contaminated with anthrax but this process has yet to begin , he said , and inspectors are proceeding cautiously to keep investigators from becoming sick mr newman said he did not know the degree to which evidence would be damaged by the decontamination procedures but he said he was confident that investigators would be able to determine if an envelope contained anthrax the postal inspectors are working with the fbi so far , four people have died from inhalation anthrax , and six others have contracted the disease seven others have contracted skin anthrax , a much less serious illness that has not required hospitalization the state department mail handler who contracted inhalation anthrax went home from the hospital today so did one of the brentwood postal workers with the disease , a 56yearold man who has not been otherwise identified another brentwood worker , leroy richmond , remains hospitalized , but he is expected to recover one of the people who died , robert stevens , and one of those who became sick with inhalation anthrax , ernesto blanco , worked for a tabloid newspaper company in florida another person who died , kathy nguyen , a hospital worker in new york , did not work closely with the mail , as far as investigators know , and her case has baffled health and law enforcement officials but all the others who have become ill are either postal workers , people who worked regularly with mail or people who were in offices where contaminated letters were received at a briefing for reporters today , postal officials showed how they had tracked the path of the letter to mr daschle and the two other letters with anthrax that have been discovered one to the new york post and the other to nbc , both in manhattan all three letters were mailed in trenton the officials demonstrated how each person who handled mail , with the exception of the state department worker , could theoretically have contracted anthrax from the spores in the letter to mr daschle those with inhalation anthrax , for example , worked in plants where the letter to mr daschle letter was processed the machines in these plans were cleaned with air blowers the workers who got sick worked downwind from the blowers , explaining how they could have come in contact with airborne microbes the people who got skin anthrax all worked at or near postal stations in new jersey where letters with anthrax were handled , or were in offices where letters were received the only exception seems to be the child of an abc news producer who had been in the abc office in manhattan , where no letter has been recovered but presumably one was sent mail processing is highly computerized , and bar codes show where letters were mailed eventually , this could enable investigators , for example , to quickly sort out all mail from trenton in search of other contaminated letters but the postal authorities said they were a long way from doing this at the fbi , officials described what they had found from a behavioral and linguistic analysis of the circumstantial evidence in the case we 're not ruling anybody out , an analyst said when asked about domestic terrorism we 're looking in that direction right now the officials , who spoke on condition of anonymity , added that it is possible it is terrorist related , potentially al qaeda , adding , but at this time there is no direct or clear linkage between these incidents and any terrorist cell or network the analyst said the person responsible was most likely a man who may have worked in a laboratory or had a scientific background if employed , the person probably has little contact with the public and is comfortable working with extremely hazardous material the person behind the attacks did not select his victims randomly , making an effort to identify each address , and used sufficient postage to ensure proper delivery the person is familiar with trenton and may have previously expressed to other people his contempt for the targets after the sept 11 attacks , the fbi officials said , the person may have become more secretive and changed his usual pattern of activity the first two letters with anthrax , to nbc and the post , were mailed on sept 18 photo senator tom daschle viewing a sample of anthrax held by jessica reinhardt of the national naval medical center at bethesda , md \( associated press \) \( pg b8 \)
the events of the last six weeks have challenged creators of newspaper comic strips some have responded by simply avoiding references to terrorism and patriotic fervor others , like aaron mcgruder , have tackled those topics head on on oct 4 , for example , mr mcgruder s strip , the boondocks , depicted one of its main characters , huey , calling the fbi terrorist tip line to report on people suspected of abetting extremists in afghanistan all right , let s see , huey says into a telephone the first one is reagan that s reag in the next day s strip , huey tried to convince the fbi , pointing out that in the administration of ronald reagan the cia trained osama bin laden and other afghan rebels to fight the soviet union the strip then suggests that the current bush administration has also given financial support to the taliban government newsday , on long island , pulled the strip for a week the daily news in new york pulled the boondocks on oct 4 and published it only once since , assessing the strip on a daytoday basis the dallas morning news has moved the strip to a page away from the other comics but mr mcgruder , the 27yearold creator , writer and illustrator of the boondocks , has not backed down last wednesday , his strip satirized the newspapers that pulled his work the first panel carried a supposed editor s note , saying that due to the inappropriate political content of this feature in recent weeks , it is being replaced by 'the adventures of flagee and ribbon' the end panel was an ad for flagandribbon action figures for just 1995 plus 495 shipping although many comic strips are avoiding even the slightest allusion to the attacks or the war in afghanistan , a notable group of others , including doonesbury and millord filmore , are sharing mr mcgruder s impulse to comment on the news after sept 11 , garry b trudeau , who won the 1975 pulitzer prize for editorial cartoons with his strip doonesbury , canceled a week s worth of doonesbury that would have ridiculed president bush s iq in their place , he began drawing strips that have addressed americans' fears of suspected terrorists and the pain of many friends and family members of victims of the world trade center attack over several days , for instance , the character mike doonesbury , on a flight to new york , wrestles with the stereotypes of ethnic profiling after being seated next to a man in muslim garb but no cartoonist has been more defiant than mr mcgruder last week s parodying of patriotism drew complaints from dozens of the 250 newspapers across the country that carry the boondocks through universal press syndicate though none of the papers refused to publish the strip in an interview last week , mr mcgruder , whose strip in the past has received acclaim , particularly for its examination of africanamerican issues , said his approach had not changed since sept 11 tackling issues that can make people uncomfortable there was plenty to talk about without making light of the situation , and there was real opportunity to make legitimate criticisms of the government and media , he said i struggled with it , and i really thought i was going to get canceled from the daily news but this is one of those critical moments in history , and i did not want to look back and regret not having said something executives at the daily news said that they believed that the heavy political content of the strips the paper had held was not appropriate for the funny pages stu vincent , a newsday spokesman , said his newspaper s editor , anthony marro , objected to the tone of two strips , but not the content lee salem , vice president and editor of universal , defended the boondocks he said that many great comic strips were criticized for some of their best work during tense times , including some of mr trudeau s doonesbury strips , which some newspapers occasionally pulled during the watergate scandal mr salem surmised that new york region newspapers were particularly sensitive because of the impact of the attack \( the new york times does not run comics \) we have newspaper clients from bangor , me , to seattle , and we cannot always serve the editorial needs of such a diverse base of newspapers , mr salem said it s understandable that in this very diverse mix of readers and newspapers , it makes sense that some might object to a particular scene that does not fit their community photos in the boondocks last wednesday , top , and doonesbury on oct 10 , the cartoonists confronted issues related to the sept 11 attacks the messages in the boondocks , created by aaron mcgruder , have prompted some newspapers not to use certain installments of the strip \( associated press \)
richard fitzgerald , a 49yearold chauffeur who lives in greenwich village , was settled on a bench on a hot and muggy morning in washington square park the other day a police officer on a horse clipclopped up a path to the side children crowded a playground , while dog owners ran their unleashed pets through a fencedin field and there was barely a drug dealer or homeless person in sight , an absence that mr fitzgerald , who has been spending afternoons in the park since he was a teenager , noted with fresh approval and lingering astonishment oh , god , there is almost no way to measure how much improvement he has done , mr fitzgerald said , the unnamed he being the city s soontodepart mayor , rudolph w giuliani i 've lived here for 30 years , and i 've hung out in this park for 30 years , and i feel so much better than i did 10 years ago , he said this park has really turned around it s gotten cleaner , it s gotten safer in the view of advisers to the mayoral candidates , there are few neighborhoods in new york where the qualityoflife improvements of the past eight years can be better measured than in the 66th assembly district it is a middleclass , mostly lowrise downtown patchwork that includes some of new york s most picturesque neighborhoods greenwich village , soho , tribeca , chelsea and battery park city among them its residents voted overwhelmingly against mr giuliani when he was first elected mayor in 1993 , and then voted to reelect him in 1997 it was a democratic district settling in behind a republican mayor , in one sign of how politics in new york were changed over those eight years these days , voters in the 66th are pleased about the health of their city and the vibrancy of their neighborhoods , a reflection of the sentiment found in much of new york in a poll taken last week by the new york times they talk of tranquil parks , anxietyfree strolls at night , a bustling local economy , cleaner streets and a city that they seek to enjoy , rather than escape on summer weekends and while washington square park may still have its ragged edges , many of the residents who use it say the improvements over the past eight years are striking but with three weeks to go until the mayoral primary , there are signs of anxiety as voters begin to consider the imminent departure of a mayor whose interest seemed so closely tied to middleclass neighborhoods like these i am worried about the future , said steven man , 55 , an optometrist who is a registered democrat i do n't know what will happen from here it could go back to the way it was i'm really not sure , and that troubles me and there is some concern about whether the next mayor who will come from what remains , for most people , an unfamiliar cast will , by choice or ability , continue the priorities that mr giuliani has embraced none of the guys out there are qualified to do it everybody out there is scary , said andrew nathan , 37 , the former owner of a restaurant on prince street , frontiere , which he closed a month ago as he prepared to move out of the city \( mr nathan , a strong giuliani supporter and a republican , said the timing of his own departure had nothing to do with the change at city hall \) there are more than a few people like marianne salerno , 60 , a medical assistant who lives in the west village , who said they would vote for mr giuliani again , were he not barred from seeking reelection by term limits i'm a little apprehensive , she said still , this is the part of new york where the reform democrat movement came alive , and that produced edward i koch \( he still lives just off washington square park \) , bella s abzug , and the birth of the modern gay rights movement , at the stonewall inn on christopher street thus , if there is something approaching an approving consensus on some of mr giuliani s policies , the mayor himself is another matter many people do not seem unhappy that the city s first republican mayor in 20 years is about to leave the stage i think the city is a little bit safer and that s good , said ilsa gilbert , a writer of librettos , poetry and short stories , who lives in the west village but i'm wondering at what cost so i'm going to be glad that someone else is going to be mayor and if some voters are not upset at mr giuliani s departure , they are nonetheless judging his successors by the benchmarks that he set for his government when asked the problems they wanted the next mayor to focus on , voters more often than not pointed to the kind of secondtier governmental functions that implicitly suggest an overall satisfaction with the way new york is delivering such basic services as police protection and garbage pickup they talked about the park system which peter f vallone , the city council speaker and a democratic mayoral candidate , recently identified as the one governmental department he would never cut as mayor or noise on the street , or municipal recreation programs , or cleaning up graffiti , or widening the new bicycle path along the hudson river
yes , the television advertising market hit one of its deepest slumps in a decade true , profits in september were ravaged when the networks were compelled by the coverage of the aftermath of the terrorist attacks to wipe out four full days of commercials and sure , no new series introduced this fall has developed into a bona fide hit none of that prevents leslie moonves , the president of cbs television , from looking over the industry at the end of 2001 and drawing a rather bright conclusion i'm guardedly optimistic things are beginning to turn , mr moonves said in a recent interview at his office on the 35th floor of black rock , the cbs headquarters building on 52nd street in manhattan mr moonves , who has been in his job since 1995 , has now presided over a network entertainment division longer than any other current executive and he has expanded his power base at cbs by adding control over its other tv divisions , most recently over upn , the other network owned by cbs s parent company , viacom so he has motives for providing the rosiest possible analysis particularly at a time when one network , abc , is in a deep tailspin and the near future for the networks is almost entirely dependent on how the national economy performs but he defends his general optimism by noting that three of the four networks will be profitable this year he notes that the socalled scatter market , in which advertisers buy commercials that were not committed before the start of the television season , seems to be picking up and he points out that primetime s longrunning hit shows , like friends on nbc and his own everybody loves raymond , seem to be as popular or more popular than ever even the old network nightmare of eroding audiences does not seem so terrifying to him any erosion we 're experiencing now is not going to the top 10 cable channels , he said it s going to channels 55 to 100 , to the chinese cooking channel i think the major bleeding has stopped that is an important trend because when large numbers of viewers were flowing to the biggest cable competitors , it undermined the network argument that advertisers have to buy the big networks to get the best bang for their buck the most obvious reason that mr moonves is selling the virtues of network tv , though , is simply that cbs , by almost any measure , is the network with the most positive story to tell its overall lead in the category of total viewers is sometimes dismissed by competitors who say cbs is still stuck with too many older less salable viewers but the statistics show that cbs is making more progress in almost every important audience category than any other network is in total viewers , for example , cbs is now averaging 128 million a week , up from 123 million last year nbc is at 125 million , down from 127 million fox is at 102 million , barely up from 101 million \( and this year its figures include a sevengame world series \) abc , meanwhile , has seen its weekly audience shrink drastically to 105 million compared with 133 million last year cbs is also the only network to have improved in the two most important advertiser sales categories of viewers those aged 18 to 49 , and those 25 to 54 perhaps most significant for a network that has lived with jokes that its audience understood the term hip only when it was paired with replacement , cbs has lowered its median age this season from 52 years to 506 , a seismic shift in television terms i think the rebuilding at cbs is going right according to plan , mr moonves said even mel karmazin , the formidable president of viacom , famed for his highpressure number crunching , is pleased , mr moonves said mr karmazin even got along with sumner m redstone , the viacom chairman , mr moonves said , trying to dismiss persistent rumors of friction between the two i was in a whole round of budget meetings with both of them , he said they were fine together one of the keys to cbs s recent turnaround has been its commitment to reality shows , an area that has taken something of a beating this tv season many television executives have called the genre all but dead , rejected by viewers who balked at its contrived realities in light of the tragic reality of sept 11 but mr moonves does not accept that argument the networks that are saying that are the ones that do n't have survivor , ' he said indeed , much of cbs s success this fall can be traced to the inclusion on its schedule of survivor , the biggest hit the reality tide has produced but even that series has been cited as proving the reality trend is waning because ratings for its current edition have not been at the level achieved by the first two editions then there is the collapse of abc s who wants to be a millionaire , a series victimized by a network so hungry for the show s heady ratings that it pushed it to four editions a week and paid the price for the overexposure in plummeting ratings mr moonves resists the comparisons of millionaire to his reality hit survivor' is the no 4 or 5 show of the season , he said , noting that it is up against a resurgent friends , which is now television s toprated show it s still the rollsroyce of reality shows mr moonves has high hopes for another reality series planned for february about fighter pilots in training he said cbs sports had been rejuvenated by the reacquisition of the national football league five years ago he noted that david letterman has staged a significant comeback in late night even cbs news has made some positive strides he said , pointing to the newsmagazine 60 minutes ii cbs is still one of the two news organizations without a cable outlet , a situation that could be rectified by a partnership with cnn one that both cbs and abc have been discussing with the cable network i do n't really think we necessarily have to make that deal , he said , though he concluded that it might hurt cbs if abc news joined with cnn instead over all , i feel pretty good , mr moonves said if the economy starts to turn , i think we could explode photo leslie moonves , cbs television president , has a positive outlook for cbs \( cbs \)
sunday q a appears in this section weekly readers are invited to send in questions about national or international affairs those selected will be answered by times correspondents who specialize in those issues information about submitting questions appears below madame chiang , centenarian q is madame chiang kaishek still alive \? a craig s smith , the shanghai correspondent , responds madame chiang kaishek , the widow of the chinese nationalist leader , is living in a duplex apartment near gracie square on the upper east side of manhattan madame chiang celebrated her 104th birthday in march with members of her family , friends and wellwishers from taiwan taiwan s president , chen shuibian , sent her a glass sculpture once one of the most powerful women in the world wielding considerable influence through her husband and as an unofficial diplomat to the rest of the world madame chiang was educated in the united states and speaks fluent english during the chinese civil war in the 1930 s and 1940 s , she was a celebrity in the united states , partly because of her beauty and partly because she is a christian she used her prominence to win american support for the nationalists against the communists , but critics accused her of extravagance and repression of dissidents after the death in 1975 of her husband , chiang kaishek , madame chiang continued to spend much of her time in taiwan during the rule of her son , chiang chingkuo but after he died in 1988 , power in taiwan increasingly moved to native taiwanese rather than to those like the chiangs who had come from mainland china madame chiang , who is also known by her original name , soong meiling , moved to a 36acre hilltop estate in lattingtown , on nassau county s north shore she sold the estate in 1998 and auctioned off most of its contents the next year madame chiang s last major public appearance was in 1995 , when she attended a reception in her honor on capitol hill , where she had appealed to congress in 1943 for help in china s war against the japanese challenge to voting system q whatever happened to the idea of abolishing the electoral college \? a katharine q seelye , a washington correspondent , responds that talk came mainly from democrats , who wanted to get rid of the electoral college when it became evident that al gore had won the popular vote but failed to win the majority of the electoral votes but any nascent national movement to alter this system , which would have required an amendment to the constitution , was squelched by small states , which would not have ratified it they worried that eliminating the electoral college would eliminate any need for candidates to campaign in their states another idea that emerged was that more states might adopt systems like those in maine and nebraska while most states award all of their electors to the winner of the popular vote , maine and nebraska award them on the basis of who wins the popular vote in each congressional district , with two electoral votes going to the winner of the statewide popular vote only one state , north carolina , seems headed that way the state s republicans , who oppose the change , say the democrats are rejiggering the system to try to rebuild their support in the south if north carolina had awarded electors on a perdistrict basis last year , mr gore would have won three of the state s 14 electors and , as a result , the presidency but if all states had used the district method , mr gore would have lost using this theory , some republicans see a possible advantage of going to a district system in states that are usually considered tossups but awarded all of their electors to mr gore last year pennsylvania , michigan and illinois fall into that category , but none have taken action napster and long arm of the law q with all of the legal trouble that napster has had with the record companies , why has n't napster \( or a similar service \) set up shop offshore , say , in the cayman islands , outside the jurisdiction of the united states \? a matt richtel , a technology correspondent based in san francisco , responds from a technological standpoint , napster could pick up its computers and operate its musicsharing service offshore but operating napster , or a different musicsharing service , from overseas could invite a host of complications both on business and legal fronts to illustrate , it helps to make a distinction between napster as a business with aspirations to become profitable and napster as a free service as a business , napster s efforts to become a profitable and technologically adept company would probably be harmed by moving overseas a move might deprive the company of the basic technological and intellectual resources required to sustain and expand the operation it might have trouble creating partnerships with other businesses and could find itself at odds with credit card companies , whose cooperation could be needed to bill customers and moving overseas would further incense the record companies and make them unwilling to license content nor would napster s legal troubles go away , particularly if it maintained any presence in the united states if any arm of napster remained in an american jurisdiction , whether it be a billing office or offices of company investors , that presence could subject the company to american legal actions in turn , investors might be dissuaded from having anything to do with the company but what if napster , or some other entity , was not interested in turning a profit and cared more about merely offering a musicsharing service \? it still would face legal obstacles legal experts say there are few piracy havens most nations participate in treaties that could impinge upon a music service s ability to operate without rightholders' consent the agreement on traderelated aspects of intellectual property rights binds the members of the world trade organization to certain intellectual property standards under the treaty , a company involved in transmitting copyrighted material for reception inside treaty members runs the risk of infringing upon their laws photo
snakeoil salesmen used to travel the country in wagons demonstrating miraclecure tonics and ointments nowadays , the internet is being used to help peddle what the federal authorities and nutrition experts say is a rising number of suspect vitamins and supplements , some of which carry the same kinds of outlandish medical claims as in years past featured on store shelves and on web sites is a growing array of new products that often carry dozens of different ingredients from trace levels of certain vitamins to pieces of dried vegetables and bits of freezedried organ meats purported to help treat a variety of ailments there are socalled fitness waters with a hodgepodge of vitamins and minerals and deer velvet supplements \( made from deer antlers and purportedly good for inflammation , infection and pain \) in recent months , the federal trade commission has been cracking down on companies that make what it calls fraudulent claims about supplements but policing the internet , with its countless web sites , is difficult worse yet , certain laws make it difficult for federal agencies like the food and drug administration to regulate herbs , dietary supplements and the like the ftc did manage to expose one questionable product known as vitamin o its marketers had claimed that vitamin o could prevent or treat lifethreatening diseases like cancer and heart disease , and physical ailments like chronic headaches , fatigue , degenerative joints , infections , colds and hypertension by enriching the bloodstream with supplemental oxygen \( hence , the name vitamin o \) but the product , which sold for more than 10 an ounce , appeared to be nothing more than saltwater , according to the ftc it filed a complaint in federal district court accusing the marketers rose creek health products and the staff of life , both based in kettle falls , wash , along with donald l smyth , the president and sole shareholder of both companies of making blatantly false and unsubstantiated health claims and last may , the companies , without admitting or denying guilt , agreed to pay 375 , 000 to consumers as part of the settlement , the ftc prohibited all three parties from making any unsupported claims for vitamin o for instance , that it could help the body absorb more oxygen through a liquid only fish can do that , said michelle rusk , a lawyer in the agency s division of advertising practices but that will probably not be the last consumers see of vitamin o it is still being sold on the web site of rgarden internationale , under which staff of life does business , albeit with a disclaimer and vitamin o brochures are still available , said dr stephen barrett , a retired psychiatrist and consumer advocate from allentown , pa i 've gotten more brochures since the court order than before , he said dennis roberts , the marketing director for both rose creek health and the staff of life , said his companies were complying with the ftc s orders he refused to comment on his company s brochure mailings still , the marketing of vitamin o does not surprise nutrition experts or consumer advocates like dr barrett , who runs the quackwatch web site that tries to track questionable and fraudulent medical claims they say the dietary supplement health and education act of 1994 limited the ability of the fda to regulate druglike claims that are made for vitamins , minerals and herbs the agency generally does not review and approve supplements before they go to market as for the ftc , it has the power to take action only against companies that make false and misleading marketing claims industry experts say the 16 billion vitamins and supplements industry has had to come up with new products because sales are no longer growing at the doubledigit rate of just a few years ago although not all of these new products are problematic , nutrition experts worry about those that are , and the fact that an increasing number of companies are marketing them on the internet , the same place where many people turn for reliable data on the health benefits of dietary supplements experts say the products often pop up on the web in nutritional quizzes , where corporate affiliation may not be readily apparent the internet means that consumers are now more informed when it comes to being able to access vitamins and supplements data , but they are also probably more misinformed than ever , said nancy cotugna , a professor of clinical and community nutrition at the university of delaware there are no reins in cyberspace in 1999 , the ftc started operation cureall , an enforcement and consumereducation campaign aimed at stopping false and unsubstantiated health claims on the internet , particularly those about serious diseases the agency opened the campaign after it did a web search and spotted more than 400 questionable sites , mostly for supplements ms rusk , the ftc lawyer , said 28 percent of those sites had since shut down or revised claims about their products we see that there is a real epidemic on the internet , said ms rusk , adding that her agency had already taken legal action against seven supplement companies
to the editor paternity debate divides net pioneers \( nov 8 \) describes a dispute over whether leonard kleinrock or donald davies was the inventor of packet switching , which is the foundation of internet technology depending on how loosely one uses the term inventor , i believe that the answer is either both or neither in any case there is more than enough glory to be shared among the several contributors to this technology i believe that i am qualified to comment on this issue , having been a member of the committee that in 1967 and '68 reviewed and made recommendations on the technical specifications for what came to be called arpanet , and examined proposals from prospective contractors i had known leonard kleinrock and lawrence g roberts since 1960 , having spent many evenings and weekends sharing the tx2 computer at mit with them while working on research projects the person who was generally responsible for initiating arpanet was jcr licklider , who outlined the objectives in a 1963 memo and later recommended to robert taylor , director of arpa s information processing techniques office , that he recruit larry roberts to do it roberts in turn drew on the ideas of a number of people in putting together the plan to develop arpanet , including the queuing theory work of kleinrock , the work of thomas marill , who had created a twonode experimental network in 1966 , and the suggestion by wes clark that minicomputers be used for packet routing at a meeting in the pentagon on oct 9 and 10 , 1967 , we reviewed draft specifications for both the interface message processor \( imp \) and packet formats i still have documentation from that meeting we did n't use the term packet but called this technique store and forward , drawing on a term long used in telegraphic networks , where messages were punched on paper tape and manually forwarded to the next link in the network the planned network was awkwardly called arpa contractor machinetomachine data communication the terms arpanet and packet switching did not come into use in the documentation until 1971 , well after it was operational as far as i know , no one on our committee was aware at the time of our october 1967 meeting that paul baran and donald davies had been independently working on similar ideas however , just after that meeting , roberts gave a paper at a technical conference and there learned of the work of davies and baran roberts has since stated that he was reassured by their proposals that the networking plan was valid and that he was influenced by the work of davies and his colleagues to start out with higherspeed links however , he recalls that essentially none of the basic design changed as a result nevertheless , davies s term packet switching was later adopted in place of store and forward because it is more descriptive roberts subsequently put out a request for proposals and , after our committee review of proposals in november 1968 , selected a group led by frank heart at bolt , baranek newman to build it they took less than a year to get it working if your definition of inventor is anyone who thinks of a new idea , then there are probably dozens of people who could qualify as inventors of packet switching if your definition requires also that the idea be communicated to others , then the list still includes baran , davies , kleinrock and roberts if you require that the inventor also find the resources to bring the invention into practical use , then i believe that you should recognize roberts as the inventor , though he had some help les earnest los altos hills , calif the writer is a senior research scientist emeritus of stanford university
when simon d roffe graduated from the stern school of business at new york university in 1998 , he wanted to be a professional investor he raised a few hundred thousand dollars from family and friends and nearly tripled his money the next year by buying many of the bull market s hot new technology stocks then those stocks came crashing back to earth i learned from my mistakes , mr roffe , 25 , wrote in a recent email message i expected to get rich quickly i went from driving a porsche boxster to being unemployed virtually overnight but mr roffe , like dozens of other investors , now wonders if there was an artificial element to the investment mania and is fighting to retrieve some of his lost gains he has joined one of dozens of lawsuits against an alphabet soup of companies that had hot initial public offerings from ariba to planetrxcom and the bluechip securities firms like merrill lynch , credit suisse first boston and morgan stanley that brought them public the suits follow a broad investigation by securities regulators and prosecutors into the ipo machine of the late 90 s , which had the breathtaking power to turn a business idea that was little more than a few bullet points on a napkin into a publicly traded company with freshly minted millionaires at its helm a central accusation of the suits , and the subject of a new inquiry by the securities and exchange commission , is that underwriters extracted promises from investment firms to buy shares of new stocks at higher prices than the offering in exchange for larger allocations of ipo s everyone , it seemed , wanted to get shares at the initial offering price , but securities firms carefully doled them out to their very best clients , and perhaps friends and family of the company individual investors usually bought after trading began , what is known as the aftermarket the lawsuits raise fundamental questions about whether the market for new issues was manipulated at the expense of the little investor , who was shut out of the offerings and had no way of knowing whether some of the subsequent buy orders might have been prearranged at escalating prices , creating artificial demand for stocks that would later erode at the time , i did n't know i was throwing loaded dice in a crooked craps game , wrote mr roffe , who bought new stocks like planetrx and marimba , but failed to receive shares of them at the offering price i was taught at nyu that market prices are reached in efficient markets , and they were n't polluted by market manipulation last august , the sec issued a bulletin reminding wall street that promises solicited from clients to buy stock in the future , known as tiein agreements , undermine the integrity of the market as an independent pricing mechanism for the offered security and are illegal , whether direct or indirect i do n't see that it caused a boom that did n't exist , said barry barbash , a partner at the law firm of shearman sterling and a former director of the division of investment management at the sec but problems arise in the ipo market in boom times , when there is a scarcity of hot allocations several mutual fund and hedge fund managers agreed to discuss the trading of new stock issues and what types of commitments were made to buy additional stocks , though many did not want to be identified it s like being a big tipper at a restaurant , said one hedge fund manager if you give 50 to the ma tre d' , you 'll get a good seat so to line up shares at the attractive offering price , the fund manager had to promise to buy more an investment banker made the consequences of not participating clear no generous ipo allocation on the next deal i can remember one conversation i had , he said , where someone said , 'well , if you want bigger allocations , you need to buy more in the aftermarket' but several fund managers suggested the practice was often less overt , with underwriters rarely strongarming investment firms of any size it s never that you have to , said andrew j kessler , who runs velocity capital management , a technology hedge fund it s the wink and the nudge in all , about a dozen fund managers described a range of relationships with stock underwriters , and none of them felt they had done anything wrong some said they were asked what their interest was in buying more after trading began and placed buy orders ahead of time some said they volunteered that they were interested in buying shares and at what price that price was always higher than the offering price while underwriters are permitted to try to prevent a new stock from sinking as soon as it starts trading , an accepted practice known as stabilization , they can do so only by buying shares at the offering price or lower and they cannot pass this responsibility on to their clients without discussing it generally , the fund managers said they made commitments to buy at least two to three times the number of shares that they were allocated at the offering

hempstead , ny , oct 8 when jets coach herman edwards walked into his team s locker room sunday night , he found players who were not acting as if they had just won an important game it was like no one was really excited that we won the game because of that score , edwards said , referring to the 4236 victory over the bills at buffalo i said 'enjoy it guys , because the guys in the other locker room are not enjoying it we 'll correct the mistakes' even when you win and you slam somebody , you still look at bad plays it was a nice touch that the defense received a game ball it created five turnovers , four leading to scores the defense has forced 13 turnovers , and the team leads the league in turnover differential , at plus11 the offense seemed , at least on sunday , to be evolving into something closer to the west coast ideal it is aiming for , with 32 runs and 25 passes , including 5 catches by laveranues coles , 2 by wayne chrebet and 3 by tight end anthony becht the jets needed all the big plays they made because the defense is still struggling with the routine ones even in the first moments after the victory , edwards noted that the run defense remained unsound it is clearly his top concern the bills' offense , which entered the game ranked near the bottom of the league , produced 473 yards and continued to expose the jets' run defense which gave up 162 yards as a work needing progress the secondary was also burned for two deep touchdown passes eric moulds beat cornerback marcus coleman in the right flat for a 46yard touchdown and safety chris hayes missed an openfield tackle that gave peerless price a 70yard touchdown i think the team is really going to have to look at this game and decide did we improve on things or did the ball just bounce our way \? linebacker mo lewis said we ca n't look at this as if we 've arrived by the jets' count , there were seven missed tackles , a vast improvement from 18 last week the linebackers , who had an atypically poor game against san francisco last week , were back to normal sunday , combining for 38 tackles , including 16 by james farrior , whom edwards called a force lewis , freed by the defensive coordinator ted cottrell to blitz , was an enormous mischief maker , sacking buffalo quarterback rob johnson and causing a fumble that was returned for a touchdown lewis later returned a fumble for a touchdown but there were still gaping holes in the middle of the defensive line , which the bills rookie travis henry ran through like the winner of a oneminute shopping spree on a secondquarter drive that led to a field goal , henry ran up the middle 4 times for 35 yards henry , who had averaged 25 yards a carry entering the game , improved his average to 34 yards after gaining 113 yards on 19 carries jets defensive end shaun ellis , who had five sacks in the first seven games last season , has none so far this season as a result , despite the big plays that won the game against buffalo , the jets' defense continued to plummet statistically , dropping from 25th to 30th in the league the defense continues to be last in the league against the run , yielding 164 yards a game that ranking is not such great news when lamar smith of the dolphins , who rushed for 144 yards against new england sunday , is coming to town on sunday there were three runs 18 , 17 , 19 yards , edwards said those were big runs and it was into the teeth of the defense we did n't play it correctly if we play it right , it s not a big run if we play it right , it s maybe a 3yard gain in the next two weeks , the jets play host to the dolphins and the rams miami is fifth in the league in rushing yards a game st louis has marshall faulk , one of the league s best offensive players the jets will need to create a lot of turnovers to offset those offenses in meetings the night before games , the jets' coaches lay out goals one is to produce turnovers another stop the run just like their record , the jets are 500 extra points receiver laveranues coles \( strained knee \) is questionable for sunday safety nick ferguson \( foot \) is also questionable , as is safety damien robinson \( left ankle \) , leaving the jets with two healthy safeties returner chad morton \( ankle \) remains questionable the good news santana moss ran for the first time monday moss ran straight , with no cutting coach herman edwards said he would remind moss not to rush his return linebacker mo lewis will most likely have to wait a few days to learn if he will be fined for the elbow to rob johnson s head that knocked johnson out of the game johnson thought the hit was dirty the jets do not lewis knocked out drew bledsoe the week before the problem he s got is he s got two quarterbacks , edwards said i just got sent a tape on quarterback hits from the league they 're trying to protect quarterbacks , rightly so the problem is , some of these guys are athletic , they run out of the pocket and they do n't run to the sideline he s a ball carrier now photo mo lewis , freed to blitz sunday , was a force , sacking rob johnson \( associated press \)
mary jane himes needed some onions for the chicken fran aise she was whipping up the other night for a split second , she figured she could pop down to the grand union supermarket at northern boulevard and marathon parkway , a block from her home then she remembered the store had closed more than a year ago , leaving a neighborhood that once had two supermarkets with none and despite an energetic lobbying campaign by ms himes and her neighbors , the stop 'n' shop supermarket chain , which holds a longterm lease on the vacant building , had not opened a replacement i'm lucky i have a car , ms himes said i drove the eight or nine blocks to a new greengrocer to pick up the onions but we have a lot of oldtimers in the neighborhood who really relied on that supermarket , and this is hitting them very hard little neck , queens , a community of singlefamily homes with about 15 , 000 people , sits on either side of northern boulevard , its main shopping strip , and many residents can walk to local stores the grand union closed when that company went bankrupt in october 2000 , after which stop 'n' shop acquired the site the building is shuttered , though its distinctive green awning remains it casts a shadow over the town , ms himes , a lifelong little neck resident , said of the vacant structure when she was growing up in the neighborhood in the 1950 s , there was both an a p and a bohack ms himes and her neighbors had hoped stop 'n' shop would open one of its own stores on the site in september , working with the little neck pines association , she and others began a petition and letterwriting campaign to force the issue state senator frank padavan , who supports the campaign , said residents sent so many letters , petitions and email messages that the company asked them to stop several hundred residents also filled out a stop 'n' shop survey to assess the need for a supermarket in the area the neighborhood s answer was clear , mr padavan said there is a large unmet need that could be very profitable for whoever meets it faith weiner , the director of communications for stop 'n' shop , said the response to the survey had been overwhelming she said the company was studying ways to open a new store on the little neck site the supermarket has always been a hub of activity and a socializing spot , ms himes said we want it back jim o'grady
lytham st annes , england , july 21 on a day of wild extremes at the british open , david duval boldly shot his way into a share of first place tiger woods suffered on the back nine , as his swing shockingly fell apart , sending him into a nose dive that left him five strokes off the lead , with 27 players in front of him colin montgomerie surrendered his lead with shaky putting , raising serious doubt as to whether he will win his first major championship but so many players made blunders this afternoon , montgomerie remained in contention , and the outcome of the tournament remained in huge doubt after today s wacky third round at royal lytham and st annes , four players were tied for the lead , and 32 players were within five shots of the them predict a winner , if you dare ten different players either had or shared the lead today , and it was hard to remember a major championship in which so many players would start the final round with a legitimate chance to win heading into sunday s final round , duval , bernhard langer of germany , ian woosnam of wales and alex cejka of germany were tied for first place at sixunderpar 207 nine players were tied at five under par montgomerie of scotland , miguel angel jim nez of spain , nick price of zimbabwe , darren clarke of northern ireland , raphael jacquelin of france , jesper parnevik and pierre fulke of sweden , and the americans joe ogilvie and billy mayfair six players were at four under par ernie els and retief goosen of south africa , sergio garcia of spain , des smyth of ireland , greg owen of england , and the american billy andrade the four players at three under par were nicolas vanhootegem of belgium , eduardo romero of argentina , niclas fasth of sweden and loren roberts paul lawrie of scotland , david dixon of england , vijay singh of fiji and mark o'meara were two under par , while woods , kevin sutherland , dudley hart , duffy waldorf , and steve stricker were at one under par none of those players could be overlooked , considering that duval was seven strokes off the lead when play started today , yet he will tee off in sunday s final group finishing before the final group even teed off , duval had a brilliant round that included seven birdies and just one bogey , conquering a course that confused so many others today i thought i needed to shoot at least four under par to have a chance , and i did that , said duval , who will be paired with langer in sunday s final group it s hard to say what will happen tomorrow asked if he could shoot another 65 sunday , duval smiled and said i think so i just did it woods , who shot 73 , may not feel as confident after today s performance , as the world s no 1 player hit the ball so poorly when the stakes were so high we needed our golf carts today so we could have got it over quicker , said o'meara , who shot a oneoverpar 72 he was paired with woods , who shot a 73 i felt bad for tiger it s not where he would like to have it , but i would n't be surprised if he lays a good one down tomorrow woods will need a great round to win his second consecutive british open a fivestroke deficit does n't sound overwhelming , but with 27 players in front of him , the chance that woods would overtake them all was slim meanwhile , he will have to regroup quickly and play far better than he did today after reaching five under par for the tournament , he played the final 14 holes at five over par he made only one birdie over the final 12 holes today after making a bogey at the par3 no 5 , woods made a crucial doublebogey at the par5 no 7 , the first sign that his swing would come unglued woods had a terrible day off the tee , hitting horrendous shots that left him in ugly spots at no 7 , woods hit a wild tee shot right into the right rough , but his next shot was even worse , drifting way right into the bushes woods dropped a provisional ball and hit it , but a few minutes later , his original ball was found but woods declared that ball unplayable , picked up his provisional ball and went back to the original spot of his second shot after taking a drop and a penalty stroke , woods hit his fourth shot into the right rough , chipped onto the green , then twoputted for a doublebogey woods bogeyed no 14 with a threeputt , missing the second putt from 2 1 2 feet at the par4 359yard no 16 , woods was fortunate to save par after he made a questionable decision , trying to drive the green his tee shot went under the right grandstand at no 18 , woods ended the day with another bogey after he smashed another errant drive way right , which forced him to take a drop and penalty stroke when the round ended , woods walked briskly past reporters and went directly to the driving range for an emergency session with his coach , butch harmon , and stayed on the range for about 45 minutes woods spoke to a royal and ancient official gathering quotes , and said that his swing had gone awry today was a frustrating round , woods said it definitely was n't my a game , not even close to that i was n't feeling comfortable with my swing and it showed neither was mongtomerie , who shot his worst round of the tournament , a 73 , after a firstround 65 and a secondround 70 montgomerie , who has never won a major championship , has watched three excellent opportunities in majors slip away in 1994 , montgomerie lost to els in a united states open playoff that also included roberts in 1995 , montgomerie lost to steve elkington in a pga championship playoff and in 1997 , montgomerie lost to els again by one stroke at the united states open if montgomerie does not win this major at age 38 , it may be the most painful setback of all though he tried to put a positive spin on losing the lead , he will have to be far steadier with his putter to win i am not leading anymore , and it might be beneficial to start in a more relaxed fashion , said montgomerie , who lippedout short putts on nos 4 , 5 , 6 , and 8 that could have changed the entire day that hurt i tended to missread putts instead of misshit them hopefully i will get that right tomorrow meanwhile , it was difficult to fathom the bogeys made on the back nine , as lytham s tough finishing holes bullied a host of players , even on a calm day that appeared tailormade for scoring cejka reached the 15th hole at nine under par with a twostroke lead , but bogeys at nos 15 , 16 , and 17 brought him back to the pack parnevik was seven under par with two holes to play , then promptly made a doublebogey at no 17 langer could have been the outright leader , but he made bogey at no 18 nobody took control , and nobody knew what would happen sunday it was clear that all the contenders felt the pressure of this major championship and sunday , the pressure would be even greater photos bernhard langer is one of the four players leading the british open \( reuters \) \( pg 1 \) the americans mark o'meara , left , and tiger woods completing the

lest we forget this season s photography offerings already reflect sept 11 two compilations of pictures about the attack on the world trade center have appeared , with more surely to follow they are welcome in part because they freezeframe a calamity so great that the mind struggles , even months later , to comprehend the data being sent by the eyes the books are also notable for having been produced with uncommon speed publishers usually take at least a year getting a book from concept to print and two more timeless books of photographs of new york , featuring lyrical blackandwhite images by helen levitt and roy decarava that are about a halfcentury old , were in production long before the terrorist attacks but have acquired a recuperative poignancy in the realm of photobook publishing , the bynow commonplace collaboration of museums with trade publishers has produced books honoring such undisputed stalwarts as ansel adams and edward weston , as well as the muchtouted contemporary artist andreas gursky more newsworthy , and arguably less savory , is the trend among commercial galleries to create books that promote photographs they are selling many of these near advertisements are beautifully done and deserve an audience , including lee friedlander the little screens and richard avedon made in france , both from the fraenkel gallery in san francisco , and philiplorca dicorcia heads , from pace macgill in new york to make matters even more ethically intricate , the most informative book of the season , the book of 101 books , is the handiwork of a dealer in rare books who also operates photography galleries in new york and los angeles september 11 , 2001 a record of tragedy , heroism , and hope by the editors of new york magazine \( abrams , 1995 \) new york september 11 by magnum photographers introduction by david halberstam \( magnum photos powerhouse books , 2995 \) both of these books describe visually and viscerally the horror of the attack on the world trade center and the unimaginable death and havoc it created some of the photographs have been published in newspapers and magazines , but without the cumulative impact that they achieve here both books were produced in record time for largely charitable motives the book by the editors of new york magazine benefits the september 11 fund of the united way and the new york community trust , while part of the proceeds of the magnum book go to the new york times 9 11 neediest fund otherwise , the two are quite distinct the editors of september 11 , 2001 use a cavalcade of pictures and captions to narrate the drama as well as to inspire feelings of empathy for the victims , rescuers and bereaved relatives the book s 88 pictures , mostly drawn from photo agencies , are shown roughly in chronological order , from the attack itself to firefighters' funerals and cleanup efforts a week later it is a heart and gutwrenching narrative enhanced by quotations from mayor rudolph giuliani , albeit a story that is achingly familiar from newspapers and television new york september 11 , the magnum book , is organized essentially as a series of picture essays by individual photographers , whose accounts of their own experiences that day provide the only accompaniment to the pictures this indulgence is all to the good , since their pictures alone carry an emotional charge that is characteristic of the best photojournalism \( by chance 11 of the legendary cooperative agency s normally farflung photographers were in town sept 11 for an annual meeting , including thomas hoepker , steve mccurry , susan meiselas , gilles peress and alex webb \) the magnum photographers did not cover every aspect of what was photographed that day for example , the kind of shots taken inside the towers before the collapse that are in the other book but they indelibly and eloquently describe the shock , terror , agony and despair felt by those close to the flames and clouds of debris the hieronymus boschlike atmosphere of the images is complemented by highquality printing and by the design , which spreads many of the book s 90plus pictures across two pages rather than end with recovery efforts , however , this volume segues sentimentally to a more innocent era when the standing towers served as a background for scenic cityscapes by burt glinn , raymond depardon and others inside and outside magnum crosstown by helen levitt introduction by francine prose \( powerhouse books , 75 \) now in her 80 s , helen levitt is one of the living treasures of new york , widely admired for her devotion to candid street photography in a style influenced by henri cartierbresson and walker evans she is also intensely reticent , if not shy , about putting her work before the public that is why this finely produced book , which amounts to a retrospective of her career , is a landmark event it reproduces both her blackandwhite pictures from the 40 s and 50 s , many of which were published in the 1965 classic a way of seeing , and her seldomseen color photographs , most of which date from the 70 s all reveal levitt s characteristic charm we see quotidian moments that reveal ordinary people to have an intrinsic beauty and grace men lean languidly on lampposts and car fenders women sit on stoops or lean out of windows children frolic on sidewalks or in vacant lots these vignettes of domestic , everyday city life , taken on the lower east side and in harlem , are a form of poetry that evokes the fortitude and forbearance of new yorkers past and present

a timely tackle or a favorable bounce for the oakland raiders 10 months ago could have substantially altered the billing for today s game at giants stadium a break here or there in last january s american football conference championship , and the meeting of the giants and the raiders on this thanksgiving weekend would have also been the rematch of super bowl xxxv in the aftermath of the baltimore ravens' rout of the giants in the super bowl , it is harder to recall that the raiders were favored to win last season s conference title game in fact , many giants , flush from their conference championship victory , were beginning to prepare themselves for a date with the raiders today , instead , the giants and the raiders meet as two teams seemingly passing in opposite directions the 72 raiders are tied for the best record in their conference , considered an ascendant team and should be a prime candidate to play host to another conference title game the 55 giants are barely a secondplace team in a weak division , have lost four of their last six games and need a lateseason charge to assure a playoff spot what makes the comparison more compelling is that the giants and the raiders were so alike just 10 months ago had the raiders beaten the ravens , the pregame analysis for the super bowl would have been that the giants and raiders were mirror images each team had a versatile running game that powered the offense more than the passing game each had a veteran quarterback experiencing a career rebirth each had a stingy defense each won by creating turnovers and each played a physical , hardnosed style it is telling how the giants and the raiders have changed since , an observation not lost on the giants as they prepared for today s game in fact , looking at the raiders last week reminded the giants of what they needed to do to rally this season today , expect the giants to return to a runbased offense with much less finesse and less chance for passing errors the giants want a lowscoring game that maximizes a homefield advantage and a talented defense the value of such an approach is evident this season , when the raiders unlike the giants developed on their strengths of a year ago the raiders still run the football nearly as much as they pass it , with charlie garner , tyrone wheatley and quarterback rich gannon each reaching triple figures in rushing yards gannon has improved on his breakthrough season last year with the highest quarterback rating in the nfl \( 1007 \) he has thrown just two interceptions the raiders' defense is giving up fewer yards in each game this season , and the offense , which had only 20 turnovers last season , has just 10 this year , the fewest in the league as for the giants , they once had a balanced runpass ratio , but have lately turned to the pass at an alarming rate in their last game , they had three secondhalf running plays and none in the fourth quarter quarterback kerry collins has already thrown as many interceptions \( 13 \) this season as he did last season yardage by opposing teams against the giants' vaunted defense is up by 6 percent the giants , who turned the football over 24 times last season , have already done so 21 times this season the lesson has not been lost on the giants last year , when i was looking at the raiders and at us , i thought we were very similar teams in terms of things like the turnover ratio and the running game , giants coach jim fassel said after friday s practice at giants stadium i do n't draw that comparison right now when fassel was asked if that might be the difference between oakland s 72 record and his team s 55 record , he nodded his head and said probably just look at all the things we 're not doing this year that we used to do with the temperatures growing colder as the giants' season grows more desperate , it is likely fassel will command the offensive coordinator , sean payton , to employ a more direct , uncomplicated game plan , one that relies on the skills of running back tiki barber with strategic doses of his backfield mate ron dayne if the giants are going to go down in flames in the final six games , they are going to go down exercising last year s strength and that was running the ball to prevent turnovers and sacks and producing lowscoring games that play to the strength of the giants' mature defense the giants , perhaps infatuated with their offensive success in their conference championship game or maybe stung by their loss in super bowl xxxv or both were moved to alter the basic offensive formula this season oakland changed little , although they did add jerry rice to improve the versatility of the receiving corps since the giants' most significant change defensively was in the secondary , a pivotal matchup figures to be the giants' rookie cornerbacks , will allen and will peterson , against rice and oakland s other future hall of fame wide receiver , tim brown it also figures that giants cornerback jason sehorn , coming off another subpar game in his upanddown season , will be needed for one of his trademark spectacular plays while covering spectacular opposition it only seems reasonable that rice and brown will take the giants' rookie cornerbacks to school a few times the seasoned sehorn must serve as the counterbalance in the end , today s game pits two teams that could not beat the ravens last january the raiders are already well on their way toward moving past that loss the giants are still trying to find a way , and an oldstyle victory over a super bowl contender would be a step on the right path photos raiders' rich gannon has the nfl s highest quarterback rating and only 2 interceptions \( associated press \) the giants are expected to use a game plan that relies on the skills of the running backs ron dayne , above , and tiki barber , at right \( agence francepresse , above associated press \) \( pg 1 \) giants quarterback kerry

excerpts from a 75minute interview with presidentelect george w bush at his ranch in crawford , tex , on friday q do you think much about the historic nature of what will happen on jan 20 about being only the second son of a president to assume the office \? a no i mean , i think about assuming the presidency , of course but i do n't i do n't think you can really define your position in history while you are alive i mean , i am defining it , but i do n't think it gets defined properly until people have passed on and objective historians start to take a look at how a presidency fits into the into the whole flow of history so i do n't worry about it i view shortterm history as generally political documents reflecting the prejudice of the writer i do n't think true history is that you really get a picture of history until a period of time has lapsed and so i do n't worry about standing and yeah , it s unique i am more interested in what he and mom will be thinking than some kind of stand q what do you mean by that \? a well , i love the thought that they are leaving in essence a legacy of people that have followed them into public service a son or two sons , governors of states , and now one is going to be the president i think that is a great testimony to them q you think that makes them proud , too \? a i'm sure it does , yeah it s got to i mean , we do n't sit around and say , you know , how proud exactly are you \? laughs q does it concern you at all , with the hullabaloo over the ashcroft nomination , that no matter what you think of him , the choice has sent a message that may disturb some americans \? a no , because i think i know that this is the short term i think he s going to do a good job i mean , every press conference i have or press availability i have , his name always comes up you 've been there you have n't been to them all , but every time , the same question arises , which is fine q does it worry you at all that those questions mean there are some americans reading into something about you from that choice \? a no , because i know my point , frank , is that i know that he s going to do a fine job i mean , he s going to be the attorney general of all people he will enforce the civil rights laws , and when it s all said and done , people are going to say , now i understand why presidentelect bush made the choice q have you talked to him about the enforcement of civil rights laws \? a yeah listen , frank , when i talked to john about the job , asking him in interviewing him , i knew that there was going to be some , you know , that there were going to be some questions he could end up being a lightning rod i mean , i felt that way on and if it had not been him , it would have been somebody else that s just part of the process q could n't you have chosen someone else who would not have been a lightning rod \? a for any for all positions \? q for that position that s one that is a particular lightning rod a what happens if i pick one for secretary of state \? you know , my point is that somebody would be made a lightning rod i am comfortable with my choice of john ashcroft i think he s going to be a very fine attorney general anyway , to answer your question , i have confidence in his ability to do the job , and therefore , believe people will begin to say , gosh , i understand and i hope you know , you noticed me yesterday talking about that he had been elected five times i ca n't remember if he had been reelected as attorney general , but let s call it four times i said that for a reason somebody who is in a state like missouri , somebody who is , you know , commonsensical , down to earth , a decent person , is going to get elected as many times as he has somebody that is not that way will end up getting defeated and the defeat of john ashcroft against in his race against mel carnahan was just an unusual situation secondly , i believe that he handled the defeat in a gracious way , which speaks to the character of the man he was unbelievably gracious in defeat q i think a lot of people said that as people have begun looking back at his past statements , though , some have raised concerns he spoke to the southern partisan magazine a southern what \? q southern partisan magazine last year , and said , you 've got a heritage of defending southern patriots like lee , jackson and davis he said , traditionalists must do more i 've got to do more we 've got to stand up and speak in this respect or else will be taught that these people were giving their lives , subscribing their sacred fortunes and their honor to some perverted agenda it has circulated around a lot a well , what are they trying to say about john ashcroft in that \? q the question , i think , was what was he trying to say \? a you need to ask him that i'm sure he will be asked that question i suspect what he was saying is that there is something noble about the southern history that they were fighting for it s like what they tried to ascribe to gale norton she was talking about states' rights , the ability of states to run their business it s been a philosophical argument throughout our history the relationship between the federal government and the states she was in no way , shape or form embracing slavery , and neither was john ashcroft q is there any lesson from what happened to linda chavez \? a from my perspective \? q yeah what s the moral of that story \? a i think you ought to take her what she said she said she made some mistakes q you agree with that she did make some mistakes \? a well , she s a fine person i'm sorry she i truly am sorry she s not a part of my cabinet q do you feel misled by her \? a i would n't say that q you think she made some mistakes \?
the walter kerr theater was full last saturday night , a happy occurrence for broadway in general and in particular for the producers of proof , david auburn s pulitzer prizewinning play , which passed its first anniversary there this week the full house was a testament to the play , a back porch drama that stands up as vivid and gripping even after repeated viewings and has evidently continued to sell tickets after a cast turnover , not to mention the calamity downtown but it is also a testament to the new fourmember cast , which largely upholds the high standards of daniel sullivan s tonywinning production , and whose ensemble dynamic gives the play new and distinct emotional shadings it does n't feel like a different play good news for those who have never seen this beautifully carpentered story about mathematics , decent people and the whimsical wiring of the heart and the brain but there is enough change for return theatergoers to play a very satisfying game of compare and contrast jennifer jason leigh is the namebrand addition , an inspired choice to follow marylouise parker in the central role of catherine , a brooding and overburdened 25yearold who may or may not have inherited both the genius and mental instability of her father , who may or may not have written the important mathematical proof of the title , who may or may not be falling in love with harold dobbs , her father s prot g , and who may or may not be packed off to new york against her will by her wellmeaning but unimaginative sister , claire ms leigh , like ms parker \( who won a tony for her star turn \) , has a naturally offbeat manner they share an odd , syncopated physical grace and a penchant for quirks of elocution but where ms parker is cagily feminine and flirtatious , ms leigh is a more straightforward and stolid presence her catherine has none of the ethereal , floaty quality that gave ms parker s performance its sexy charm unlike ms parker , who seemed reborn in the flattering black dress catherine slips into for her father s funeral , ms leigh never looks comfortable in it indeed , ms leigh goes out of her way to hide her attractiveness under a bushel there s something about girlishness that her catherine finds offensive she becomes most alive when speaking of mathematics and dreamiest when telling hal about sophie germain , the 18thcentury woman whose work with prime numbers impressed gauss her sexual invitation to hal is without coyness where ms parker s emphasis was on catherine s insecurity , her helplessness at the confusion in her mind , ms leigh gives catherine a strain of bitterness , an emotion that arises out of confidence and where ms parker made you wonder at the seeming serendipity of the brain \( how could such a woman , so collegiate , pretty and languorous , be either a genius or a madwoman \? \) , ms leigh makes catherine a more strident and highstrung personality in the grip of a habitually overactive mind you can easily imagine her in feverish midnight concentration over a page of equations , and just as easily tipping over the edge she is wellmatched with patrick tovatt as her father over the summer mr tovatt , the first replacement cast member , played opposite ms parker after taking over from larry bryggman , but he is only now with his natural stage daughter he s a brawnier , more imposing man than mr bryggman , mustering a more fearsome temper in a secondact flashback , his argument with catherine threatens to become physical this is a family that responds to pain with pride and rage , not the overwhelming sorrow that was its signature in its earlier incarnation as claire , seana kofoed fits easily into this spinier clan she makes the character less officious than her predecessor , johanna day , less cowed by her younger sister , a shade more appealing as a person poor josh hamilton has the misfortune of being the outsider here , and unfortunately he seems as flummoxed by the character of hal , a math nerd redeemed by selfawareness and wit , as hal does by the formidable family he confronts here lanky , bearded , unquirkily handsome , mr hamilton plays the part with an odd stillness , his hands almost always unnaturally at his sides , his feet planted with nary a shuffle his nervousness around catherine is more exasperating than charming , and anyone who remembers the physical antsiness and wryly goofy delivery of ben shenkman , who created the role endearingly , will miss him it also needs to be said that the play gets off to a rocky start , with all the actors in the opening scene seeming not yet warmed to each other , not listening carefully nonetheless , by the middle of act i , the performers are on track , and mr auburn s play is the beneficiary it remains an astonishment that the playwright , still just 32 , has joined an admiration and sympathy for his characters and a careful delineation of their different strains of intelligence to a structure that is as astutely crafted as an artisan cabinetmaker s the unfolding of the characters and their relationships , the timely interjection of genuine laugh lines , the surprise firstact curtain line that transforms the play suddenly into a mystery , the flashbacks and dream sequences that reveal wellprepared surprises they 're all calibrated to seduce an audience along in the land of suspended disbelief , and they remain in full force and will be familiar to anyone who has already seen the play but by the evidence , proof has the roominess in it to accommodate a whole new family at its center , and that s a discovery proof by david auburn directed by daniel sullivan set by john lee beatty costumes by jess goldstein lighting by pat collins original music and sound by john gromada technical supervisor , neil a mazzella production stage manager , james harker associate artistic director , michael bush presented by the manhattan theater club , lynne meadow , artistic director barry grove , executive producer and roger berlind , carole shorenstein hays , jujamcyn theaters , ostar enterprises , daryl roth and stuart thompson at the walter kerr theater , 219 west 48th street , manhattan with patrick tovatt \( robert \) , jennifer jason leigh \( catherine \) , josh hamilton \( hal \) and seana kofoed \( claire \) photo jennifer jason leigh as catherine in proof at the walter kerr \( joan marcus proof \)
the new england chicken potpie and the shrimp pasta salad were about to be loaded into the delivery vans at jason s catering regular buffet lunches en route to the world trade center for 300 employees of two companies that were the small catering firm s linchpin clients but that was on the morning of sept 11 , and so , of course , the lunches were never dispatched the two companies accounted for 25 percent of the corporate catering firm s orders wholesale cancellations of business meetings and parties by other clients in manhattan have the previously prospering jason s , in the west 20 s in manhattan , reeling from a total business plunge of up to 75 percent , its owners say we are hemorrhaging cash , one of the owners , gary lyons , said this week throughout new york city , hundreds of small businesses , from travel agencies to livery taxi companies and messenger services , have suffered severe blows since the trade center attack some are in general fields , like travel and tourism , and others , like jason s , did a major part of their business with companies that were in the trade center or close to it it will probably be months before the attack s longterm effect on the city s small enterprises can be assessed , as many of the severely weakened companies succeed and others fail in the struggle to regain their footings but jason s offers a microcosm of this struggle and of the fears of workers at small businesses hit hard by the disaster a nineyearold company with 30 employees , jason s had been built with a great deal of effort , said its second owner , john jason from a groundfloor kitchen that sends cooking aromas into the intersection of 11th avenue and 28th street in an industrial slice of chelsea , the company catered thousands of meals a day for midtown and downtown clients , like sony , ralph lauren and morgan stanley dean witter its steadiest , most reliable income , mr lyons said , came from two accounts one was keefe , bruyette woods , an investment firm on the 88th and 89th floors of 2 world trade center , which ordered a daily lunch for more than 100 employees the other firm , baseline financial services , an information technology company on the 77th and 78th floors of the same tower , had ordered a buffet lunch for 200 employees three days a week keefe , bruyette has reported that a third of its employees at the trade center are missing on monday , nearly two weeks after the attack , a keefe representative called on jason s to begin supplying breakfast and lunch for 20 employees at one of the sites where the investment firm had temporarily relocated , mr jason said he expressed confidence that this meant that keefe , bruyette would resume its high volume of business once it was again at a single location so far there has not been any indication of what will become of the business with baseline , he said as mr jason , a tall , muscular 39yearold , spoke about his efforts to resuscitate his business by drumming up new clients and seeking more jobs from existing ones , he suddenly choked up and fought back tears this is not about accounts receivable , he said i knew so many people in those buildings unlike many catering operations , jason s is not part of a restaurant or food shop and thus has no other income to offset catering losses mr lyons declined to provide overall revenue figures before sept 11 but said that despite the downturn in the economy , we were having a good year , as strong or slightly stronger than last year he said that at least 80 percent of the meals his company was to have catered since the attack and in coming weeks had been canceled , at a probable loss of about 100 , 000 , which is in addition to the longterm losses involving the two main accounts no employees have been laid off , mr jason said , and he expressed determination that none would have to be i truly believe we will rebuild this company , he said nearby , looking up from bowls of pasta and platters of grilled chicken that he was routing for delivery , glen james , 30 , an employee from brooklyn with a young daughter and a wife who works part time , made clear that he was rooting for his bosses i 've got to pay my rent , he said that does n't stop photos emeterio vega has worked at jason s catering , at west 28th street and 11th avenue , for four years john jason the second owner of the nineyearold caterer , is confident i truly believe we will rebuild this company , he said
beijing , april 17 negotiators from the united states arrived in beijing today for meetings with chinese officials to resolve issues surrounding the midair collision of an american spy plane and a chinese fighter but the rhetorical gulf between the two sides seemed huge and if anything widening last thursday , china released the 24member crew of the spy plane after receiving what it characterized as an apology from the american side , which it said was responsible for the crash but since then , american officials have made it crystal clear that they believe that their pilots were blameless in the incident , which left a chinese pilot dead and a 100 million spy plane in the hands of china s military as the time draws near for the meeting on wednesday , agreed on as a condition of the crew s release , intercontinental finger pointing has increased armed now with the testimony of crew members , american officials say that wang wei , the chinese pilot , was a dangerous daredevil , who twice came within feet of the american plane before hitting its propeller on the third pass but on monday a decree signed by president jiang zemin posthumously proclaimed mr wang a hero , a guardian of territorial airspace and waters and today , a foreign ministry spokeswoman , zhang qiyue , condemned irresponsible remarks by some us officials recently , which did n't respect the facts and confused right and wrong at the meeting on wednesday , there will be little specific common ground just a vague mutually stated desire to preserve a constructive relationship reality is running up against china s propaganda machine , which had developed its own mythologies about this event , said david shambaugh , an expert on the chinese military at george washington university the posture that both sides have taken and their lack of leeway , for domestic political reasons , suggests that it will be hard to accomplish much at this meeting , at least not quickly the agenda will include a discussion of how the incident occurred , terms for return of the american spy plane and rules for future reconnaissance flights the planes collided about 60 miles outside of china s territorial waters china has announced that it wants the united states to stop such reconnaissance flights but american military officials have already said they plan to resume them , although no date has been set , and the united states wants to set up rules to keep chinese and american planes at a safe distance from one another the eightmember american delegation is headed by deputy undersecretary of defense peter f verga , and its members are mostly from the military the chinese delegation is headed by lu shumin , director of the americas department at the chinese foreign ministry , and includes both foreign ministry and military officials the chinese government has not specifically responded to the detailed accounts of the american crew members that have come out since their release last thursday , after 11 days in detention and the american version presents the chinese government with a quandary almost since the moment of impact , the chinese government has vehemently insisted that the lumbering ep3e aries ii spy plane turned suddenly in midflight , ramming the nimbler chinese plane it says the severely damaged american spy plane landed in china illegally because it did not issue a distress call or request permission to land contradicting those assertions , lt shane j osborn , the mission commander and pilot , said he recalled thinking , this guy just killed us , as the chinese pilot crashed into the american plane s wing , sending the plane into a 7 , 000foot dive lieutenant osborn said the ep3e issued many landing requests none of which were answered before it landed on china s hainan island chinese popular opinion , which last week supported standing up to us hegemonism , seems to have softened a bit this week , particularly after word of the american version of events filtered into beijing although the crew s accounts have not been repeated in the state news media , they are available on the internet and though a large number of chinese are still angered by what they consider an abrupt and dismissive initial statement by american officials after the collision , many people say they believe that it was merely an accident one that should not damage china s relations with the united states i do n't think the us needs to apologize to china , and the people i know agree with that although few are willing to say it , said dai qing , a writer and social commentator but while popular opinion seems to have been tempered a bit in beijing , the chinese government may be forced to stay at the extreme position that it hastily staked out at the beginning of this crisis , when officials demanded that the united states accept full responsibility for the collision although the collision was accidental , the escalating tension was not , said ms dai , who complained that the government did not give people the information necessary to make a rational decision about the incident backing down from the official version of events , already two weeks old , would severely damage the credibility of china s government and its propaganda machine the best hope , experts say , may be for the united states and china to agree diplomatically to disagree as they have on so many previous events the common ground is a mutual desire to preserve the overall framework of the relationship , said mr shambaugh , the expert on the chinese military one has the sense now that this relationship is spinning downward and needs a floor
at the ballet , male stars often draw gasps from audiences and boost sales at the box office but american modern dance , a genre spawned and nurtured by women over the last century , has also produced a proliferation of extraordinary male dancers in the last decade wider public acceptance of men entering the dance field , the fostering of versatility among dancers and the accessibility to better training across america have produced discernible results more men in contemporary dance have stronger techniques , dance with refined musicality and possess a more mature artistry than ever before lar lubovitch , a choreographer who has worked in every medium , from broadway to fulllength ballets , is presenting his company in men s stories , a work for an ensemble of nine men men s stories , which starts a fourday engagement at city center on wednesday , demonstrates the change that highly trained men have brought to contemporary dance , an evolution in jumping , partnering and emotional energy for a man to choose a career in modern dance is no longer the anomaly it was two decades ago while there are no hard statistics on the growing number of men in modern dance , the trend is evident anecdotally , there appear to be more men in the dance field than there were 20 to 30 years ago , said john munger , a spokesman for dance usa , a national research organization he cited as possible reasons the popularity of hiphop dance forms and an increase in the number of dance programs in colleges many men who would have previously joined ballet companies now opt for modern dance to achieve a more personal sense of artistic fulfillment they are able to retain the techniques required of ballet but use them to express a 21st century sensibility rather than one from the 19th there is a level of reality available in modern dance that people can attach to , mr lubovitch said during a break from rehearsing men s stories at his 42nd street studio in manhattan it helps them respond to the moment in time rather than to what is expressed by a historical form philip gardner , 33 , who performs in men s stories , has danced in ballet companies but defected to modern dance several years ago it seems that people my age that have had ballet experience get fed up with the structure and corporate vibe of a ballet company , he said there is also a kinetic connection to really good quality modern dance that is technically challenging lar s work is very much like that david parsons , whose troupe begins two weeks of performances at the joyce theater on tuesday , seeks out men who have both technique and imagination i like to choreograph in a way that mirrors the contemporary world , said mr parsons , who was a prominent dancer with the paul taylor dance company during the 1970 s and 80 s i think that young men appreciate that as well just as ballet companies have benefited from having modern dance added to their repertory , modern dancers have benefited from better ballet training such versatility has helped break down the formerly solid boundaries of dance for contemporary dancers , versatility can mean using techniques from jazz to ballet to gymnastics judith jamison , the artistic director of the alvin ailey american dance theater , has seen a substantial increase in the technical skills of her male dancers since she took the post in 1989 the men in the company adjust to the line and style that the choreographer is asking for , she said it could be based on modern technique or could have ballet origins men are able to make these adjustments because they train in so many techniques they incorporate yoga , crosstraining and other disciplines into their daily routines to bring out the best more than anything , though , the expressiveness that has been the trademark of modern dance has not only attracted men into the field but has also pushed them to become better artists the men need to be strong and macho yet sensitive , ms jamison said on stage they need to have a sense of themselves they need to dance with authority and at the same time express the joy they feel when performing the ailey company is to start its annual new york season in november benjamin harkarvy is the director of the juilliard dance division , perhaps the finest example of the many american university dance departments that now develop firstrate contemporary male dancers mr harkarvy said feminism had surprisingly liberated men to become better dancers the choreographers of the last 15 years have wanted men who are people , not just partnering bodies , he said it fits perfectly with the time more men have been so helped by feminism , because with the breaking down of barriers , we can also begin to find where we are alike or not alike , and also that we all have emotional lives movement has no words and is totally dependent upon a silent language men and women both possess that language for jason mcdole , a juilliard graduate featured in men s stories , the opportunity for a career in contemporary dance might not have been available to him 15 years ago mr mcdole says he was born to dance , but he was also born with an 80 percent loss of hearing the physicality of modern dance allowed him a means of communication for the first time , i could really express myself , because i did n't talk that much , nor did i feel comfortable to talk , but i was able to speak through dancing , he said \( he now wears hearing aids that have improved his hearing capacity to 50 percent \)
the last several years have been difficult for those seeking to rent large blocks of office space in a single building in manhattan yet getty images , which calls itself the world s biggest provider of photographs and other visual materials , is moving its approximately 500 new york employees from seven scattered locations into almost 225 , 000 square feet in a 17story building in tribeca in a further twist , the space had not been listed with brokers or otherwise advertised for rent the space is on the fourth and fifth floors in a triangular , 11 millionsquarefoot building , at 75 varick street , renamed 1 hudson square getty images has also acquired 36 , 000 feet more across the street , in adjoining buildings at 1216 vestry street and 200 hudson street getty images also has an option on an additional 72 , 000 square feet of space on the third floor at 1 hudson square , effective at the end of january 2002 , but meantime , since its consolidation did not require as much space as it thought , it has put its 73 , 000 square feet on the sixth floor on the market founded in london in 1995 but based in seattle since 1999 , getty images at first wanted 35 , 000 square feet for a new york office but it acquired five new york companies scattered across seven locations in manhattan in the last six years , and its space requirements soared the new york companies include the image bank and the visual communications group , previously getty s two biggest competitors getty s search and negotiations took more than a year before the final lease was signed last april it took time , effort and determination to put it all together , said james meiskin , the president of plymouth partners , which represented the new york real estate operations of getty images , because it involved consolidating the seven getty locations , and the landlord had to buy out and relocate 13 companies that occupied the space that getty moved into because none of that space was on the market , mr meiskin said he and tim kucha , a director of plymouth partners , had to convince the building s landlord that it was worth many millions of dollars for it to negotiate the early end of the 13 leases getty s lease , for 15 years with options , is valued by real estate executives at 175 million to 200 million getty s new landlord is trinity real estate , a unit of the parish of trinity church , which owns extensive property in the hudson square area like many other landlords , in the last several years trinity has not been renewing the leases of its lowestpaying tenants so that it can replace them with higherpaying ones simultaneously , it is upgrading its buildings , including a revamping of at least 1 million at 1 hudson square most of trinity s lowestpaying tenants in recent years have been printers or related businesses all but a few of the 13 companies that have been moved from 1 hudson square , or soon will be , were affiliated with the printing industry none had their leases ended involuntarily , said stuart a christie , a former real estate lawyer who has been leasing offices for trinity for three years in addition , mr christie said , five of the 13 who accepted buyouts moved into other trinityowned buildings in the surrounding area mr meiskin , mr kucha and marshall j cohen , a lawyer with the manhattan firm of stadtmauer bailkin who represented getty images , each said that trinity was as concerned about honoring its existing contracts as about the additional rent it would get from getty they were terrific , mr cohen said of trinity they 've worked hard to turn the building into a beautiful piece of real estate , and they were honorable in our dealings mr meiskin contrasted the trinity negotiation with an earlier one on behalf of getty images involving 68 , 000 square feet in a building on eighth avenue we had a handshake with the owners and told them to prepare leases , he said but after we agreed on terms , we learned the owners decided to lease it to others for more money while the search for space and subsequent negotiations were long and complicated , getty images had no complaints jonathan klein , the company s cofounder and chief executive , said it was well worth the wait , adding cheerfully moving is always complicated show me one that is n't the company s other cofounder , as well as president , is mark getty , a grandson of j paul getty , the oil magnate , who died in 1976 getty images has 2 , 600 employees consolidating its new york operations meant that certain companies that getty images acquired had to go through more than one move before settling in at hudson square but we took the view that it was important to consolidate , mr klein said , important financially , culturally and for an easier flow of expertise having acquired companies in many lands with many cultures , he added , when we put people together geographically , we find they have more in common than they think

rio de janeiro , feb 25 the first time rinaldo ribeiro hacked into the computer , he did it in less than three minutes vendors from the largest information security companies in the world had rigged the system , a windows nt server , to try to keep him out , but that did not faze him nor did the several dozen people who were watching his every move on a large overhead video screen what bothered him was that it had been too easy i talked to the guy in charge afterwards to ask if they had left the flaw in on purpose because it was really simple and quick , said mr ribeiro , whose boyish grin makes him look younger than his 26 years mr ribeiro is a professional hacker with m dulo security solutions , an information security firm here he broke into the system in new orleans 16 months ago while attending a conference sponsored by the sans institute , a leading research center for the security world each year , the institute challenges industry professionals from around the world to try and hack into a secure internet server of the 40 or so people who tried to beat the computer in new orleans , only mr ribeiro and two others succeeded when mr ribeiro defended his title last march at a conference in orlando , he was the only one that time , it took him eight minutes he plans to defend his title again in may , at a conference in baltimore he seems like he really knows his stuff , said christopher pettit , a senior security officer at the computer sciences corporation and a designer of the sans institute s challenge i would tend to hire a company like his because i know i would have somebody who understands what is going on that is exactly what m dulo is counting on the company , with employees like mr ribeiro , and with a second round of venture capital financing expected to close any day , is a market leader for information security in brazil , serving clients here like microsoft and abn amro having acquired five smaller security companies the last year , m dulo is setting off to conquer new markets elsewhere in latin america and in the united states its goal is to become one of the largest security companies in the world m dulo , with revenues of 136 million last year , is housed in a nondescript office building in downtown rio , and it still has a long way to go to catch up with current leaders the major consulting firms , like kpmg , provide security services , as do big software vendors like oracle but analysts say that the market is ripe for new contenders there are so many momandpop information security companies out there , like the software industry 25 years ago , said darren lacey , managing director of the information security institute at johns hopkins if you are good at it and you can get a few flagship customers , you are a player though technology companies are suffering , the information security industry is booming , thanks in part to a growing number of highprofile attacks last month , for instance , vandals broke into the computer system of the economic summit in davos , switzerland , and downloaded files filled with personal information on the participants with companies scrambling to protect their privileged information , the worldwide market for security services is projected to grow to 172 billion in 2004 from 55 billion in 1999 , according to the international data corporation , a market research firm the united states is expected to account for nearly half that spending m dulo was founded in 1985 by 13 students at the federal university of rio de janeiro , home to one of only two mainframe computers in the country at the time with computers only trickling into the protected brazilian market , the partners recognized the potential security risks in allowing a number of people to share the same computer , and they set about developing software that would limit each user s access as brazilian banks started automating , they became m dulo s first big clients , and the company s security services grew along with its clients' needs by 1993 , the company had developed a patented method , called security analysis and certification , to evaluate a company s security risks a process that involved everything from debriefing employees to staging hacker attacks we find all of the vulnerabilities that a company might have networks , laptops , palmtops and especially personnel , said jaime ara jo , vice president for marketing and business development at m dulo we had a client once who had information stolen because a competing company hired away the driver of the ceo s car the next year , m dulo got its big break , winning a contract from the brazilian government to secure a nationwide project to computerize voting in last year s municipal elections , m dulo trained 2 , 000 poll workers and provided security for more than 13 , 000 electronic voting machines throughout the country the company also won a federal contract in 1997 to provide security for income tax filing over the internet last year , 11 million brazilians filed tax returns electronically but according to mr ara jo , the fortunes of the company really changed when the partners decided to enter a business plan contest sponsored by the brazilian government in 1997
san antonio , may 18 they have two of the premier big men in the game , pro basketball s best record and homecourt advantage the san antonio spurs should be trumpeting their dominance and the chance to win their second title in three years , but they awkwardly shuffle around the alamodome , answering the daily inquiry how can you possibly stop kobe and shaq \? tim duncan and david robinson appeared to be in charge of their domain , but the postseason ascension of shaquille o'neal and kobe bryant has made them little more than figureheads heading into game 1 of the western conference finals saturday night nothing we can do about it the media likes the big markets , robinson said we 're not new york or la we just play the spurs and the los angeles lakers plowed through the first two rounds of the conference playoffs san antonio lost two games , los angeles none leaving the west relatively low on drama and high on anticipation the twin towers vs the twosided triangle is worth the hyperbole i do n't want to talk a lot of junk , but i think it s going to be one of the most exciting series left to be played , spurs forward malik rose said everybody s been talking we 've been injured , they 've been injured we 're all healthy now and ready to go aside from the o'nealrobinson showdown , there are other intriguing matchups after finding a way to limit the effectiveness of rasheed wallace of portland and chris webber of sacramento in the first two rounds , the lakers' horace grant faces his toughest assignment in duncan , who has averaged 25 points and 154 rebounds in nine playoff games and with the spurs' derek anderson sidelined for at least part of the series with a separated shoulder , antonio daniels will be asked to do the improbable contain bryant horace does a pretty good job of guarding tim , anderson said he s big enough down low to put a body on him and he s agile enough on the perimeter to play him so that s going to be a challenge for him anderson s injury , sustained in the second round when he was flagrantly fouled by the mavericks' juwan howard , was supposed to shelve the slashing shooting guard for as long as six weeks yet anderson , san antonio s best hope at neutralizing bryant , was knocking down 3pointers with regularity today in practice while anderson ruled himself out for games 1 and 2 , he was hoping to engage in a fullcontact practice by next tuesday and maybe play as soon as game 3 in los angeles on friday it s going to be a great series , with or without me , anderson said but if you take anybody s secondleading scorer away , that hurts san antonio won 58 regularseason games , while the lakers tied the philadelphia 76ers for the league s secondbest mark with 56 yet if the spurs have been on a roll winning all but one of their playoff games by 13 points or more it has been los angeles s incredible sixweek run that has swung the pendulum toward the lakers they have not lost since april 1 to the knicks going 70 in the playoffs and 150 over all bryant is averaging 307 points in the postseason , with o'neal adding 306 points and 166 rebounds a game o'neal has been getting position in the low post that is impossible to defend , several inches from the basket after consecutive 40point , 20rebound games against sacramento in the semifinals a first in the national basketball association playoffs o'neal has never looked more dominant there is a lot of special preparation for shaq , robinson said we 've got to make him work as hard as he can for baskets he s going to do what he s going to do , duncan said we just have to concentrate on wearing him down , keep his dunk count down and make him work for everything he gets spurs coach gregg popovich said they are obviously the hottest team in the league they are a really good defensive club , a heck of an offensive club and play unselfishly it s going to be a heck of a challenge for us if the competitiveness on the court is not enough , the offcourt war should suffice o'neal has been harshly critical of robinson , against whom he still carries a grudge for apparently brushing aside his autograph request when o'neal was a student at cole high school in san antonio lakers coach phil jackson has accused the spurs of playing a zone defense and said their 1999 title should carry an asterisk because it came during a lockoutshortened season the spurs , who swept los angeles in the conference semifinals en route to that title , have been quiet on most issues that s how they roll , that s what they do , duncan said that s great for them if it works for them , they keep on doing it , i guess it does n't work for us we just go out and play home court should be a factor the lakers have lost six of their last seven games at the alamodome to me , winning in san antonio falls on shaquille , derek fisher , the lakers' point guard , said he wo n't like me saying that , and i'm glad he s not close by , but i feel like his energy , his thrust , his power , his dominance is the only way that we win in san antonio without his power inside , we 're almost useless against a team that presents two big guys in the middle like that so , it presents a unique challenge for him , where he s in a position i feel like he needs to carry us and the rest will follow photo david robinson , left , and tim duncan are seeking their second title in three seasons \( reuters \)
atlanta , may 4 for 14 years , the gold club has been the destination of choice for a restless segment of the city s huge convention business , clusters of boisterous men footloose in the city and eager to spend those precious evenings away from home in the company of nude dancers and expensive cigars shuttle buses to the club leave regularly from the city s best hotels starting next week , however , the city s more adventurous tourists may just as well ask their concierge to direct them to the federal courthouse downtown , where arguments in the gold club racketeering trial will begin after 18 months of legal preparation for pure salaciousness and dark intrigue , the trial is likely to rival anything that goes on in the private back rooms of the club itself over most of the summer , federal prosecutors will try to prove that the club was a cash conduit to the gambino organizedcrime family of new york , which they say provided protection in exchange the club and its owner , steven e kaplan , overcharged and doublebilled the credit cards of unsuspecting customers , according to a federal grandjury indictment issued in november 1999 , adding to the unreported income of mr kaplan and the gambino family and most provocatively , the government charged that the club s dancers were ordered by their employers to provide sexual services to a long list of professional athletes and other celebrities whose presence at the club helped raise its profile in one example of what the grand jury called organized prostitution , the indictment said the club flew several of its dancers to charleston , sc , in the spring of 1997 to perform a lesbian sex show and have sex with members of a professional basketball team lawyers involved in the case say the government s witness list is likely to include professional athletes like patrick ewing , dennis rodman , terrell davis and jamal anderson , among many others none of the athletes are charged with a crime no money is alleged to have changed hands in the sexual transactions but last month judge willis e hunt jr of united states district court ruled that testimony regarding sexual activity at the club was admissible whether or not it constituted prostitution the ruling all but guaranteed that the witness list would resemble a box score or a gossip column , supplemented by dancers who may identify their private clientele another possible witness is john a gotti , who federal investigators say was the acting head of the gambino family after his father , john j gotti , was imprisoned for life , and before he himself was imprisoned in 1999 for racketeering and extortion the younger mr gotti , who prosecutors said was a friend of mr kaplan s , was transferred from upstate new york to the federal penitentiary in atlanta on april 25 , but prosecutors will not confirm that they intend to call him as a witness the seven defendants in this initial trial from the indictment who include mr kaplan , several colleagues and an atlanta police officer have pleaded not guilty and hired some of the city s bestknown and most ferocious defense lawyers the defense team said the government had built its case on untrustworthy criminals and denied any ties to organized crime on monday , the lawyers began asking potential jurors their opinions about prostitution and the hbo show the sopranos , and judge hunt has already suggested that testimony could continue through labor day a mafiathemed trial like this one , commonplace in the northeast , is a novelty in atlanta , never an underworld hotbed it has generated enormous local interest , with newspaper and television accounts of every legal move \( the atlanta journalconstitution s web site offers to email readers regular trial updates \) a doorman at the club said the publicity had significantly increased business , and the seven lawyers involved do not seem to mind the attention in 20 years of practicing here , i ca n't think of any case in atlanta that s ever involved new york mafia allegations , said donald f samuel , a prominent local defense lawyer who is representing larry gleit of dix hills , ny , the club s financial officer it s not a typical georgia case of course , my client and kaplan are just nice jewish boys from long island the case has also shed light on atlanta s growing distinction as a capital of the nudedancing industry the city s 22 gentlemen s clubs rival in number only those of miami and houston , thriving on atlanta s convention business and its political tolerance while northeastern cities have struggled to restrict sex businesses , the industry has grown unfettered in many bible belt areas , and atlanta is by far the largest city that allows alcohol to be served in bars where full nudity takes place yes , god bless them for that , said don waitt , publisher of exotic dancer magazine , an industry publication and it s got good weather a lot of dancers do n't want to live in places like milwaukee with few other major attractions to entertain them , conventioneers in the city descend on the clubs each evening in taxicabs and shuttle vans , dropping tens of millions of dollars a year into the city s economy at the gold club , a hulking black structure in midtown with two gold lions by the door alongside a somewhat more menacing security staff , limousines and expensive cars pull up to the valet parking entrance in an unending stream while other clubs have developed a more bluecollar clientele , the gold club has worked to attract celebrities from the worlds of sports and entertainment , hoping that lesserknown dance enthusiasts would follow much of the trial will be devoted to describing just how important such business was it s sort of like the studio 54 effect , a former employee of mr kaplan s told the grand jury , according to a transcript obtained by the journalconstitution the more the word went out on the street , the more people wanted to come to your club photo the gold

if one had to pick out photographs that tell the history of new jersey in the 20th century , what would they be \? hillary murtha , curator of exhibitions at the cornelius low house middlesex county museum in piscataway , spent a year and a half tackling the problem as she prepared for portrait of a century , an exhibition on view through nov 30 it is the first exhibition to chronicle the events what i tried to find were very specific instances relating to things that are generally known and to uncover some hidden history , ms murtha said for example , very few people know that the first television broadcast took place in whippany in 1927 and that the enola gay was manufactured in paterson so in many ways we 're tied in to national and international events portrait of a century begins when 66 percent of the state was farmland and john b smith , new jersey s mosquito man , began draining new jersey s mosquitoinfested swamps to prevent malaria the oldest photograph , from 1901 , is of william mcadoo , an unsuccessful presidential candidate , who was successful in completing the hudson manhattan railroad tunnel , where the path trains now travel to locate photographs , ms murtha , a south plainfield native whose training is in the history of decorative arts , consulted with historians and visited corporate archives , museums , libraries and historical societies in and out of the state she corresponded with far flung institutions like the george bush presidential library and museum in college station , tex , which sent her a photograph of gen h norman schwarzkopf , who was born in trenton , returning from the gulf war ms murtha chose 250 photographs the images include an abandoned film studio in fort lee elizabeth gurley flynn rallying striking silk workers in paterson in 1913 homeless workers encamped in hoovervilles in the newark meadows and the ku klux klan on parade there is also a picture of nellie morrow parker , bergen county s first black school teacher the klan tried to scare her off , but she continued teaching and retired after 42 years woodrow wilson , joyce kilmer , al capone , einstein , the inventor of streptomycin , selman waksman , and the surrogate mother mary beth whitehead are all here so is senator joseph mccarthy , shown touring fort monmouth there are pictures of yippies protesting at fort dix and feminists marching in paterson , the new jersey performing arts center being built in newark and hurricane floyd flooding bound brook in 1999 along with the photographs are some new jersey artifacts a pair of orange earrings are made of bakelite , the world s first plastic , invented by dr leo baekeland who founded the general bakelite company in perth amboy the state s music is represented by bruce springsteen , frank sinatra and the ragtime composer james p johnson , who was born in new brunswick and wrote the 1920 s hit charleston the exhibit is an amazing accomplishment , said barbara tomlinson , a retired kean university professor and one of the historians ms murtha consulted ms tomlinson said ms murtha had taken on an enormous task new jersey is very complex it has seen many changes over the past 100 years , far more than some other states ms murtha said that one of her greatest frustrations was not being able to find a picture of women voting for the first time in 1920 i looked high and low , she said it was an event of astounding historic significance which it seems no one cared to document prohibition also presented a problem it was very difficult to find any images of a genuine speakeasy or illegal stills , she said while it was something that took place everywhere , it was against the law a picture finally did turn up in the collection of a local historian it shows a man standing next to a big tub i do n't know whether it was a picture taken during a raid or why someone actually photographed this illegal activity , said ms murtha but i was very happy to get it many visitors to the exhibition recognize places in the photos , and one man recognized himself in a picture taken in the 1950 s he was one of the rutgers university students protesting the dismissal of a professor who had refused to testify about whether or not he had communist party affiliations none of the photos in the exhibition are by famous photographers the identity of most of the photographers is unknown , including the identity of the person who took the exhibition s signature photograph of workers building the lincoln tunnel under the hudson river in 1935 it shows them dramatically silhouetted under the lighted arc of the emerging tunnel and it is ms murtha s favorite it captures a lot of what we are trying to talk about in this exhibition , she said first of all , there is the image of progress in new jersey at the same time , it s a depression image and one of the workers is an africanamerican , so it portrays some of the ethnic diversity of new jersey i also think , aesthetically , it s a wonderful image it really is the light at the end of the tunnel photos soldiers turn in equipment before mustering out at camp dix in 1917 hillary murtha with a quintessential new jersey image \(

the streets of washington heights in upper manhattan these days ring with the unmistakable din of a clamorous , vigorous political campaign the posters are everywhere on storefronts , lampposts , virtually any place they will fit and every day , at any time of the day , sound trucks meander the streets , with an announcer promoting one candidate or another with meringue music blaring in the background the race to succeed city councilman guillermo linares , the city s first dominicanamerican elected official , is a rollicking political contest in washington heights , new york city s dominican heartland the campaign is fueled partly by old antagonisms , new political faces and no shortage of candidates at first glimpse , the race for the democratic nomination in the 10th council district could easily be viewed as the latest in a series of clashes between the longtime rivals , mr linares and assemblyman adriano espaillat , both of whom have political prot g s in the race but the contest is far more complicated because there are a total of eight candidates , all of them dominican , and many have their own neighborhood or political history , making the race utterly unpredictable the race is being eagerly watched , not only because it will determine the victor if one indeed emerges from the latest war between these two elected officials but it will also help to establish who will emerge as the newest political leader in the city s fastgrowing dominican community the two prot g s have significant political heft of their own victor moriseteromero , 34 , the executive director of the association of progressive dominicans , spent 10 years as an aide to mr linares he is known to many in washington heights because he helped to establish the amber charter school and helped create the twenty first century academy for community leadership , a dual language public school mr espaillat s candidate is miguel martinez , a former democratic party district leader and bilingual education teacher who is now director of victims services for the washington heights and harlem child care domestic violence network mr martinez , 31 , is president of the political club whose most notable member mr espaillat , who became the first dominican member of the state assembly in 1996 but there are other candidates ydanis rodriguez , 36 , a former public school teacher who now directs a college preparatory program , has a long history of activism , from being president of the dominican student association at city college to helping organize protests against apartheid and police abuse and there also is roberto lizardo , the president of community school board 6 and a supervisor with the city s department of health mr lizardo , 36 , ran four years ago against mr linares and received 27 percent of the vote in a threeway race when he was the candidate endorsed by mr espaillat there are four other candidates giovanni puello , 46 , is a former teacher and bodega owner , who most recently served as an aide to manhattan borough president c virginia fields ruben dario vargas , 49 , is an evidence specialist in the new york city police department , who has run unsuccessfully for congress and for manhattan borough president francesca m castellanos , 35 , is a translator who also ran against mr linares in 1997 and there is tirso santiago pina , 46 , a staff member in the environmental services department at the columbiapresbyterian medical center the 10th council district includes not only washington heights but also portions of inwood and marble hill to the north the district is primarily working class , with a large number of small businesses , from groceries to other retail stores it is 84 percent hispanic , and most of the residents are dominican it is also an area where many residents live without health care and where the public schools are severely overcrowded if fundraising is an indication of political efficacy , however , the major players would be mr moriseteromero , mr rodriguez , mr martinez and mr lizardo for example , mr moriseteromero , who has been endorsed by a host of manhattan democrats , including former mayor david n dinkins , has so far raised 71 , 000 and has received 75 , 000 in matching city funds , the maximum a candidate is eligible for so , too , has mr martinez , who has raised 61 , 000 in addition to the matching funds he has been endorsed by herman d farrell , the manhattan democratic party chairman and the patrolmen s benevolent association mr rodriguez , who has raised 64 , 000 and received about 70 , 000 in matching funds , also received significant labor support , most notably from district council 37 and local 1199 , and he has had more individual contributors than any other candidate in the race mr lizardo has raised about 34 , 000 but has not yet qualified for matching funds none of the others has raised more than 14 , 000 in large measure , the candidates address similar themes , with a great emphasis placed on the need to build new schools and to rehabilitate aging buildings and make more housing available to low and moderateincome residents mr moriseteromero supports a plan to use revenues from property taxes to build more schools and to expand afterschool programs in the district mr martinez talks about expanding services for senior citizens and to get money for additional child care and preschool programs mr rodriguez is passionate about the need to involve more young people in civic and community activities and mr lizardo has published a 50page campaign booklet discussing his views on everything from the need for the city to do more job training to the need for more municipal parking each of the candidates particularly mr martinez and mr moriseteromero discourages any characterization of the race as part of the longstanding linaresespaillat feud nonetheless , each of the two camps has competing sets of candidates running with them on the ballot for county committee positions and judicial delegates as a way of generating voter turnout another point made by the candidates is that anyone can win an eightway race in which a few thousand votes might easily determine the victor is thoroughly unpredictable photos ydanis rodriguez , left , campaigning on st nicholas avenue \( george m gutierrez for

what with the television movie about maris and mantle , everybody s been getting nostalgic about the good old days of 1961 having been a boy reporter back then , covering around 25 yankee home games , i recall most of us having absolutely no problem with roger maris hitting 61 homers , as opposed to the fictional theme in the movie that year , maris was a decent , sardonic guy who could really play most of his tsoris came later , when the wheels fell off the yankee bus what with the mets and the yankees showing the staggers early this season , i have been fastforwarding to the bad old days of 1966 in my memory of 1966 , i can see ralph houk , the redux manager of the yankees , sitting in the dugout , splattering tobacco juice perilously close to our shoes and reciting his mantra of yankee inevitability you know mantle is going to hit , houk would say you know maris is going to hit you know tresh is going to hit you know howard is going to hit the thing was , none of them ever hit again , at least for the yankees maris , liberated from his poisoned relationship with the club , would have a rebirth in st louis , but in 1966 the yankees hit rock bottom it was kind of funny , although i could n't openly smirk since i was allegedly a neutral professional \( who had suffered terribly as a dodger fan as a lad \) the yankees were the most arrogant team in the land , a starchy men s club , but just about all of them got old or infirm at the same time they stuck out their proud jaws and carried on like yankees , but they slid right down to sixth place in 1965 and deadlast 10th in 1966 so , you say , the current yankees and mets cannot possibly tumble all the way down the stairs from the world series to alsorans maybe not but before the ninth inning yesterday , the mets had looked downright putrid , while the yankees have been playing bad ball until this weekend the yankees beat oakland , 76 , yesterday to run their record all the way to 1311 , only good enough for third place in their division those other participants in last fall s subway series are in the same predicament as the yankees , although for a cheaper price the mets' management made no bold moves over the winter , preferring to tough it out with much of the same crew that had so much fun last season surprise the mets are 914 after rallying to beat the cardinals , 65 , in 11 innings in st louis nothing personal against either the yankees or the mets , but it must be said a setback for both of them would only be good for baseball if the playoffs began this week , the american league would be represented by the mariners , red sox , blue jays and twins meanwhile , the national league teams would be the phillies , cubs , dodgers and reds no yankees , no mets , no braves , no indians new faces a few smaller markets sneaking into the playoffs despite the lack of big cable money how cool would that be \? the slow starts of the mets and yankees have little or nothing to do with their managers bobby valentine , playing the hand he was dealt , can only hope his regulars return to form meanwhile in the bronx , joe torre , working without a contract for next year , achieved his 500th victory as a yankee manager , and can reasonably expect a bunch more having reached that milestone , joining houk and four other yankee managers , torre can afford to sound just like houk did in 1966 when chuck knoblauch whacked four hits yesterday , torre matteroffactly said , we 've got something coming with jeter , meaning that his lads have not yet hit their stride he s probably right , but there is the feeling that this is the year to get the yankees , while they are still going with older players like paul o'neill , scott brosius , tino martinez and el duque hern ndez , before they have a chance to seriously reload we have some people who may not be back next year , torre volunteered after winning this double sputter by the yanks and mets could have dire consequences for the stadiums they insist they need \( good grief , even the football giants are babbling about a new stadium did n't they just tinker with giants stadium \? what s up with that \? \) without the civic hysteria that we rubes in new york achieve when the yankees stage yet another tickertape parade , fiscal responsibility may rear its sober head facing harder times , public officials and taxpayers may indeed demand that funds go to schools and bridges trivial stuff like that poor , diligent fred wilpon did all his homework , had real architect renderings which he would unroll at the slightest bidding but wilpon has been set back years while george steinbrenner and mayor giuliani bumbled now merry king rudy is making weird promises of new ballparks ballparks for everybody ! but his regime seems to be out of time for such frivolity plus , look at it this way if you had a subway series every october , new yorkers would not appreciate how much hard work and skill it took in retrospect , the best thing for new york would be to look back at 2000 and say , was n't that a great time \? on the other hand , you know jeter and piazza are going to hit

beijing , april 30 over the last six months , the state security ministry has started detaining american citizens born in china and questioning them about their affairs in china in what diplomats believe is a worrisome change in government policy it is the first time since the korean war that american citizens have been held by china s state security apparatus , diplomats and china experts said since late last year , six american citizens none of them prominent critics of china have been questioned and detained for varying lengths of time by state security , a secretive ministry charged with ferreting out threats to china s national security , largely those from abroad the group includes businessmen , writers and academics two , li shaomin , a professor of marketing at the city university of hong kong , and wu jianmin , a freelance journalist , are still in custody , apparently on suspicion of espionage , although there have been no official charges a number of chinese citizens with permanent residency status in the united states have also been held , a western diplomat here said but he added that it was harder to keep track of this group , since the chinese government is under no obligation to report such detentions and american officials have no right to assist green card holders under current consular agreements with china the diplomat added that it was certainly possible that other detentions had occurred , particularly those lasting under four days , the time at which china is obliged to report detentions of american citizens to embassy officials here it was only in december last year that we became aware that there was a shift in the way chinese authorities are dealing with this group , the diplomat said what links them all is that they are of chinese origin although obviously they have settled out of china all had previously traveled to china , some frequently the detentions highlight new government scrutiny of a group that has become prominent in china s business and academic sectors in recent years chinese citizens who went to the united states to study in the 1980 s and 90 s and are now returning in large numbers to work often armed with liberal ideas and a foreign passport or green card in part because of the mystery surrounding the detentions , the state department issued a travel advisory last month urging american citizens and green card holders originally born in china to carefully evaluate their risk of being detained , even if they have traveled to china many times before without a problem it suggests that people who have had links to taiwan or who have engaged in activities critical of chinese policies should take special care diplomats and scholars both here and abroad say they are unsure exactly what has prompted the shift , although they note that it comes at a relative low point in americanchina relations many point out that the current spate started around the time that a highranking officer in the chinese army defected to the united states , greatly embarrassing china s security forces one chinese source , who provided information on condition of anonymity , said that a state blacklist of undesirable foreigners , which once contained a few dozen names , had recently been expanded to 273 , and that most of the additions are people born in china who now live overseas the source said several of those who had been detained were on the list , which tended to aim at people who had a history of contacts with taiwan which china considers a breakaway province or people who were suspected of publicly discussing delicate information about political or military affairs in china gao zhan , a green card holder who has been charged with espionage , is a sociologist affiliated with american university who specializes in women s issues and had attended conferences in taiwan although the chinese government has not said what activities led to the spying charge nearly 400 china specialists from around the world have signed a letter protesting her arrest but others in detention , like qin guangguang , a green card holder charged by state security with leaking state secrets , was a businessman , according to acquaintances another possible reason behind the detentions is that china s leaders have repeatedly urged the country s police to be tougher on crime in the last half year and that has included specific admonitions from president jiang zemin himself to be more vigilant about possible incursions by hostile foreign forces other scholars speculate that some of the detentions may be linked to the publication abroad last winter of the tiananmen papers , said to be a collection of secret documents from the 1989 military crackdown on prodemocracy demonstrators in tiananmen square but the government has offered little information to clarify exactly what offenses this group of obscure american citizens and green card holders are supposed to have committed china s state secrets law is vaguely defined , and when charges involve state secrets , those detained lose many of formal rights granted others , including the right to see a lawyer
newark , jan 3 about 1 , 200 orphaned pieces of luggage stood in ranks against the wall in the luggage claim area of newark international airport s terminal c today , blocking foot traffic and adding a frenzied air to the airport s postholiday chaos this socalled leftover baggage lost , misdirected or misplaced when flights are diverted or connections missed is normally locked up behind closed doors as airline employees work methodically to reunite the bags with their owners but the last five days have been anything but normal , officials conceded , as the region s airports struggle to recover from the snowstorm that temporarily closed them down on saturday and led to the cancellation or diversion of hundreds of flights the backlog of bags began building last saturday , when 1 , 800 pieces of luggage clogged the area the largest pile of leftover luggage the airport has seen in at least four years the weekend s storm forced continental airlines , the principal tenant of terminal c , to divert 54 flights and cancel 200 others in the process , the bags which sometimes fly on different flights from their owners were stranded in newark other airlines had backlogs of luggage , too , but none as big as continental , which uses newark as its second largest hub , after houston airline employees have whittled the baggage backlog in the last few days , though the normal accumulation of additional bags has added to the pile i know from the outward look , it looks like things are n't moving , said christine monday , continental s supervisor of baggage services at newark , as she surveyed the suitcases , duffel bags , strollers and car seats that clogged one side of the terminal but it is moving she said the airline expected to clear up the backlog by saturday , barring any more weather problems john jacoby , assistant manager of airport services for the port authority of new york and new jersey which operates newark , la guardia and kennedy airports said that with a storm the size of last weekend s , the largest in the new york area since 1996 , it takes time for all kinds of airport systems to get back to normal ms monday said she had called in 12 extra baggage specialists she said they were finding that many people who were separated from their luggage when a flight wound up at a different location or was canceled had taken things in stride and headed home trusting that continental would eventually sort things out and as they have called in with their claim ticket numbers , ms monday and other baggage specialists have begun the computer tracking necessary to reroute the luggage to their owners but there have been some trying customers who feel that they are the only ones inconvenienced , ms monday said in those cases , she and her staff have to try harder to keep smiling but she said she had heard no heartwrenching tales of lost or misplaced wedding dresses or band instruments our biggest thing is that people were coming home with their christmas presents and have gotten separated from them , she said those are the kinds of emotions we are getting in this backup , and people seemed to recognize that their luggage is not lost , just delayed photo like other airlines , american was still sorting through stranded bags yesterday at newark airport \( suzanne dechillo the new york times \)

washington , march 26 two competing foreign policy camps are emerging in the bush administration an ideologically conservative pentagon and a more moderate state department which have already provided president bush conflicting advice on central issues at the pentagon , secretary of defense donald h rumsfeld is collecting a hardline group of advisers who have supported arming the iraqi opposition to overthrow president saddam hussein and who are deeply skeptical of the european effort to form a rapid deployment force alongside nato on the other side of the river , at the state department , secretary of state colin l powell stepped out in front on iraq with ideas to modify sanctions , but found his policy belittled at the pentagon although he is a product of the pentagon , he has usually been a cautious warrior in a sign of the backbiting , european diplomats were told by paul d wolfowitz , deputy secretary of defense and one of the most avid backers of the iraqi opposition , not to consider the state department s description of sanctions policy to be the last word , and to be wary of its more accommodating stance on the european force , officials said on other issues , the state department appears to be more open than the pentagon to possible missile negotiations with north korea on russia and china , too , general powell is likely to place more emphasis on working with allies than is mr rumsfeld , who has a history of supporting a unilateral approach at some point the president is going to have to decide what foreign policy he wants , because he is not going to get consistent options on many issues , a senior administration official said in an ideal world , there is nothing wrong with the president s receiving clashing recommendations as long as the differences are discussed in private and the president s decisions , once made , are carried out , this official said indeed , all administrations endure policy debates , but try to prevent them from becoming public ideological cleavages although the administration is still in its relatively early days , there is evidence that the disputes are unlikely to be kept quiet , in part because of the strong ideological undercurrents word has gone out to conservative writers and think tanks from administration hardliners to keep up the pressure , a think tank policy analyst said mr bush , who is inexperienced in foreign affairs , has acknowledged that he will rely on his most senior policy advisers so as the competition among them intensifies , vice president dick cheney , who collected his own foreign policy specialists , more powerful than any gathered by previous vice presidents , is likely to be an important arbiter from the state department , at least , mr cheney is seen as leaning more toward the pentagon , where he served as secretary of defense under president bush s father the national security adviser , condoleezza rice , who has projected herself as a policy coordinator rather than a policy maker , also prides herself on having mr bush s ear so far , ms rice s predilections in the interdepartmental rivalry are not clear as mr rumsfeld selects a markedly conservative group of officials to serve under him and as general powell chooses a more moderate lineup heavily dominated by career foreign service officers , the battle lines seem sharply drawn mr rumsfeld , for example , has selected douglas j feith for the chief policy job at the pentagon , officials said mr feith , who served in the reagan pentagon , is close to richard perle , a neoconservative who served the reagan administration and is on the board of the center for security policy , a conservative defense analysis group the position of assistant secretary for international security affairs has gone to peter w rodman , a staff member at the nixon center who is viewed as a conservative on russian and european issues in contrast , general powell chose richard haass , an advocate of sanctions reform and an opponent of arming the iraqi opposition , as the head of policy planning at the state department mr haass is another veteran of the previous bush white house and has served as director of foreign policy studies at the brookings institution for the most part , general powell has turned aside suggestions of hiring ideologically driven republican loyalists for the state department it is very clear that rumsfeld wants a pentagon populated with a conservative team who see themselves in a policy clash with powell and they are gearing up for it , said robert kagan , a fellow at the carnegie endowment for international peace and columnist at the conservative weekly standard it s fair to say that this is shaping up into a shultzweinberger battle royal of the reagan administration , he said , referring to the policy and personal frictions between secretary of state george p shultz and secretary of defense caspar weinberger in the current situation , though , the principal players general powell , mr rumsfeld and ms rice have by all accounts maintained cordial personal relationships going back a long time there is none of the personal animosity that permeated the shultzweinberger relationship , colleagues say the three players have been meeting once a week for lunch and check in with each other on the phone every morning at 7 15 but on policy issues , in contrast to what was expected , the new group recreates the ideological divisions within the reagan foreign policy team rather than the more cohesive approach of those who served president bush s father tests of how the competing spheres are reconciled will come in several areas iraq , where a new sanctions policy is being formed taiwan , where the battle will be over selling advanced weapons russia , where the fight will be over how to deal with moscow on missile defense the balkans , over how far to assist the europeans in peacekeeping and north korea , where the question is whether to pursue missile talks begun under president clinton mr rumsfeld has said that the european deployment force makes him nervous because he sees it as possibly weakening nato general powell said last month that the united states went into the balkans with its nato allies and would leave with them so far mr rumsfeld has not addressed this issue administration officials say they have now started the policy review on iraq even though many of the senior posts at the pentagon and the state department are yet to be filled mr cheney s shop is also playing a role his national security adviser , i lewis libby , has shown sympathy toward arming the iraqi opposition against mr hussein , while at the national security council itself , one assistant on the middle east , kenneth pollack , who openly opposed arming the opposition , has left at the state department , much of the sanctions policy is based on assessments drawn up by mr haass , who has said economic sanctions should be eased to stop punishing the iraqi people , while financial and military sanctions should be tightened to this end , the state department has proposed to states neighboring iraq that united nations monitors be posted on their borders as well as at key foreign airports to prevent mr hussein from importing materials that would help him manufacture weapons of mass destruction at the pentagon , however , mr wolfowitz has made it fairly clear that he believes sharpening sanctions is probably not possible , and that trying to topple president hussein is more desirable
the cayuga lake air had been so still at night that sitting on the porch swing , by the water , it seemed as if you might hear a car door slam two miles away morning broke , hot and hushed i stepped off the dock into cool water and muck after a few minutes of wading i came upon the fish near the reeds , right where they had been the day before they looked as long as yardsticks now and then one rose , dimpled the surface , and eased back under , all with the slightest movement of fin to satisfy your expectations , i should now be telling you that these fish were trout , bass , salmon or pike they were none of the above they were longnosed gar , waiting in ambush in the thin water and heat i reached into the bucket , hooked a shiner through the lips and flipped it to the nearest fish , which snapped at it and swam off with the tiny tail hanging from its jaw i swept the rod backward the gar leapt from the water in a high , slashing twist , and then it bolted , a living fossil leaving behind a hearty swoosh it was something to tell chipper , who would want to know gar are prehistoric fish narrowsnouted , thickly armored , airbreathing and vaguely reptilian in appearance that have remained similar in form for 100 million years dr melanie stiassny , curator of fishes at the american museum of natural history , calls the seven extant species the last few tips of an evolutionary tree that reaches to the cretaceous , which makes them rough contemporaries with the stegosaurus one species the longnosed endures in new york state , residing in the st lawrence and niagara rivers , as well as lake ontario , lake champlain and the finger lakes , according to edward woltmann , a state biologist they may be more widespread than that , but it is hard to know most people pay them no mind this is a mistake , as chipper mcelwee and i learned since childhood , mcelwee and i have fished cayuga lake , a 38milelong glacial trench in central new york that we regard as our personal reserve of freshwater gamefish and food for the pan together we cast lures and flies and sometimes we troll slowly in a whiteandblue boat that is almost 40 years old chipper is the third generation of mcelwees to memorize this water , and through a lifetime of trial and error he has assembled bits of fishing knowledge into patterns of plenty he knows , with something between confidence and certainty , which shelves the trout roam in march and april , which coves hold perch in may , and which weeds and piles of rock attract bass from june through september some of these bass are the stuff of daydreams , exceeding 4 , 5 or 6 pounds there were summers we fished for them until our faces ached from the squinting we never bothered with gar we had seen them over the years , of course , including some we estimated at longer than 4 feet but they seemed creepy and dim , and we did little more than trade stray facts about them from old books they are primeval their eggs are poisonous and one species , the alligator gar , grows longer than 8 feet in the south , where men have been known to shoot them with guns then came vacation and a heat wave , and i left manhattan for a week of basscasting and cardplaying at the mcelwee cottage on a sunday slog through the cove to catch sunfish for dinner we noticed the gar what if , i more or less said why not , mcelwee more or less answered i threw jigs at them none took that night mcelwee went home for work i sat on the swing , sipping beer , listening to silence , thinking about gar gar have big teeth for a reason to hold and kill fish i decided to set aside purism and get straight to business i would cast them live fish they proved willing the next day when shiners , each holding a small hook , rained down from above the first few fought unremarkably , even on 4pound test but then some of the hooked gar jumped twisting skyward , flopping sideways , sending up frothy splashes when they fell back to the lake one jumped twice like a bass only higher mcelwee ducked out of work and returned to the water on wednesday , bringing with him his elephantine memory for all things related to cayuga lake fish gar jump \? he was enthused he quickly recalled years worth of gar sightings , and soon we puttered the boat into another cove , dropped anchor and waded to a bar of gravel and sand a few dozen gar milled before us , right where he said they would be in an hour we caught and released four or five , and mcelwee hooked a bigger one , which dashed three times for deep water before tiring at his feet as he lifted the fish maybe 40 inches long and weighing 7 or 8 pounds it thrashed and its teeth nearly raked his face mcelwee jumped backward and dropped it the fish broke the line we had spent decades coaxing secrets from this lake we knew on that day that there would be loons on the surface between the spring hole and aurora , and trout underneath them we knew that fine bass were finning near certain rocks who cared longnosed gar were in , and they were hungry give me another minnow , mcelwee said , suddenly impatient those big bass , fodder for daydreams \?

tampa , fla , jan 23 fourteen games into his rookie season of 1998 , the giants' coaching staff finally came to shaun williams and told him the team would need him for something other than special teams a safety who was the team s firstround draft pick eight months earlier , williams had seen little action as a spare part in the secondary but in their 14th game of the season , the giants were playing the undefeated denver broncos , and the giants' defensive coordinator , john fox , had decided that williams was the perfect man to shadow denver s pro bowl tight end , shannon sharpe the 6foot2 , 215pound williams had a reputation for enjoying physical play , and the giants felt he could handle sharpe , who is 240 pounds , in the middle of the field they also figured that williams had the quickness to handle sharpe if he lined up wide the question was whether williams was seasoned enough for the wily sharpe sharpe , who would catch 10 touchdown passes in 1998 and 64 passes over all and average 12 yards per catch , caught just 4 passes against the giants , none for longer than 7 yards and none in the end zone more significant , with the broncos in giants territory and driving for what would have been a goahead score late in the third quarter , williams stepped in front of a john elway pass intended for sharpe and made a gamesaving interception the giants upset denver , 2016 williams got a game ball it is little wonder then that the giants , as they approach super bowl xxxv , again have plans for williams to cover sharpe , this time with sharpe as the centerpiece to the baltimore ravens' passing attack williams is now the giants' starting free safety , so it will be impossible to have him trail sharpe from sideline to sideline , as he often did in the giantsbroncos game two seasons ago but it will be one of the matchups you 'll see , fox said today sharpe is an explosive guy , often too much for a linebacker to handle he s not a prototypical tight end because he does more but with shaun , we have a guy who is used to playing big guys tough but who also has the agility and reflexes to keep up we 'll have a variety of ways for handling shannon sharpe , but that will be one of them it may be the best answer the giants have for sharpe , because middle linebacker mike barrow would probably have trouble staying with sharpe on deep pass routes and strong safety sam garnes is not quick enough , either for his part , williams is not shying away from the matchup with sharpe asked today what he learned from his experience against sharpe in 1998 , williams answered i learned that we can win against him that s basically what i learned now in his third nfl season , williams has emerged as a confident spokesman for the defense along with garnes , another young leader , he is part of the upthemiddle backbone of the defense it is a talkative defense , and williams respectful , wellspoken and selfassured fits right in he is a rising star , perhaps a future pro bowl player , who is popular with his teammates because he is unselfish when the giants' special teams floundered in november , williams volunteered for extra duty there this season was a breakthrough for williams on a variety of levels before training camp , he had never started an nfl game , and while he had been a top draft pick and had the confidence of the coaching staff , there was a perception that the giants were gambling by giving him the starting job vacated by the free agent percy ellsworth williams had also been injured in each of his first two nfl seasons and this season , he missed all of training camp with a sprained toe but williams was ready for the season opener and started every game although he has a slight hamstring pull this week he made 85 tackles during the regular season and intercepted 3 passes late in the season , fox showed his confidence in williams by cutting him loose more often in the team s blitz packages it paid off for the giants , as williams frequently penetrated the opposition s passing pocket in the giants' conference championship victory over minnesota , williams sacked daunte culpepper and caused a fumble on the first play of the second half emotionally , the turnover crushed the vikings and the fumble led to the giants' final points in their 410 rout i'm sure some giants fans did n't know what to expect from me before this year , but i always knew what to expect , williams said today people said i had never started well , i had never started in the nfl i had played a lot of football i was sure i was ready as the season went on , williams also carved out a signature play the crunching hit on a receiver crossing over the middle he kept a lot of opposing receivers uncomfortable and he knocked jacksonville s jimmy smith out of their dec 23 game hitting is an attitude , williams said fox had a different take hitting is timing and attitude and athleticism , he said shaun has all three photo shaun williams , tackling troy walters in the nfc title game , has emerged at free safety \( vincent laforet the new york times \)

finally , the folks who select nominees for the tony awards have a few worthy contenders in the best original score category , which has tended to be an embarrassment ever since broadway was occupied by british invaders and disney investors the goal each year is to choose at least four scores for consideration but even the tony nominating committee has its pride in 1989 the offerings were so pathetic that the categories of best original score and best book for a musical were eliminated then there was 1995 , when an awardbydefault was given to the sole nominee for best original score , sunset boulevard , with music by andrew lloyd webber and lyrics by don black and christopher hampton this year s nominees \( the awards will be presented on june 3 at radio city music hall \) include the producers , the megahit at the st james theater with a surprisingly deft and zingingly humorous score by mel brooks , as well as the full monty , a solid and winning entertainment with a poppish , pleasing score by david yazbek at the eugene o'neill both mr brooks and mr yazbek were expected nominees , as was edward kleban , posthumously , for a class act , a plucky and disarming show at the ambassador about the frustrations and fleeting triumph of a beloved broadway denizen , kleban himself , who died in 1987 but a class act does not exactly have an original musical score the book , by lonny price \( who also directs and stars \) and linda kline , was constructed around existing kleban songs that were not intended to go together though none of these three scores represents a significant advancement in the genre , all are in the tried and true tradition of the musical , where the whole idea has been to tell the story through songs that combine words and music in felicitous , clever , surprising and , when called for , touching ways there is still plenty of highminded schlock on broadway , which the tony nominating committee feels compelled to take seriously witness the final bestscore nomination , for jane eyre , at the brooks atkinson , with music by paul gordon and lyrics by mr gordon and john caird that is , if you can call inept and gaggingly banal lines like forgiveness is the mightiest sword forgiveness of those you hate will be your highest reward a musicaltheater song lyric roll over , frank loesser what s refreshing , perhaps even a breakthrough in a backwardlooking sort of way , is that the scores for the producers and the full monty sound as if the last 25 years of pseudooperatic spectacle had never happened for that alone , each score deserves grateful cheers from diehard devotees of the musical and awards galore next month \( the first hour of the tony show will be broadcast from 8 to 9 pm on pbs and the following two hours on cbs \) as these shows suggest , perhaps one way to salvage the broadway musical genre is to go back a couple of decades and start over of course , all through this bleak period there have been holdouts trying to maintain the tradition , gifted composerlyricists as different in style as william finn , jonathan larson , adam guettel and jason robert brown and then there is stephen sondheim , the living master , an innovator who knows his roots no matter how musically complex and linguistically ingenious his lyrics , no matter how psychologically rich his storytelling , all his scores are based in the wordsandmusic heritage of the musical on some level , every sondheim score pays homage to older genres and styles of musical theater of some two dozen songs in follies , a nominee for best revival at the belasco , a good half are elegantly rendered pastiche songs that evoke , with clear affection and a twist of irony , a virtual catalog of old broadway song types in a way , the producers is a pastiche score too but mr brooks s attitude is unblinkingly satirical , with just a twist of affection mr brooks is a brilliant comic , not a brilliant songwriter , and he knows it his selfconfessed compositional method is to plunk out tunes at the piano to go with his witty lyrics , then hum them into a tape recorder , give the tapes to a musicologist friend to transcribe into notation , and hand the sketches to his arranger , glen kelly he may not be a trained musician , but he has sure musical instincts and a keen ear for imitating styles if you go out whistling the tunes , it s because they are like many tunes you 've heard already true , the songs are generic but that s the whole point though mr brooks satirizes everything from dirty old ladies to stormtrooping nazis , his main target is the broadway musical itself each number is a thinly veiled sendup of some musical song type the first ensemble number , opening night , is a brooksian takeoff on rousing curtainraisers like cole porter s another op'nin' , another show the twist is that our hero , max bialystock , true to form , has produced another flop the lyrics have a borscht belt hilarity when the firstnighters sing of bialystock , the songs were rotten , the book was stinkin' what he did to shakespeare , booth did to lincoln ! , the joke is answered with a nasal blast of brass from the orchestra pit , just the way a drumandcymbal riff used to alert a catskills audience that the standup comic had just delivered the punch line
the bostons by carolyn cooke 180 pages houghton mifflin company 12 it has been 40 years or so since the boston and maine railroad carried passengers as well as freight , and 181 years since boston governed maine , then part of massachusetts whiffs of an old colonial attitude persisted longer in one respect the relationship between mainers in the communities along the coast and the wealthy boston families who for generations arrived to spend summers on their properties in a brahmin display of nodisplay , they might call these camps but even in their scruffyoxford , fadeddenim , socklesstennisshoe and wretchedhat informality , the reedyvoiced men and resonantvoiced women gave off an air of separateness that they would be the last and those who breathed it , the first to call superior the mainers who sold them groceries and liquor , repaired their boats and roofs and looked after their places in winter were in no way subservient if anything , particularly over the last few decades , it was the summer folk who labored to exercise their anxious version of considerateness they were , in some places \( perhaps no longer or only rarely \) , called the bostons hence the title of carolyn cooke s keen , chilly collection of short stories most are about these bostons , others about the mainers significantly , ms cooke sets the former not in their maine summers but back in their thinning winter lives thinning , mainly , because they are old , failing , poorer and cut off their maine sanctuary no more than a memory , not so much nostalgic as uneasy the three maine stories , by contrast , deal with characters who are turbulent , struggling and sometimes dangerous it is a divide not just of setting and theme but also of fictional quality the disorder and passions of the maine families may suggest more opportunity for a writer s own engagement and vitality in fact , though their stories are full of picaresque incident , they seem contrived dirteaters tells of a visit to a shiftless backwoods family by relatives who have come up a little and are variously contemptuous and pained by the squalor in girl of their dreams , a teenager finds herself unexpectedly excluded when the wild boy she lives with confronts her father instead of a fight , the two males bond mourning party tells of a wake for the same boy , grown up and now dead the messy gathering includes two women he lived with , his mother and his father , who is on thorazine after shooting her these stories may remind us of carolyn chute , but they lack her carnal overtheedge engagement they seem written from the outside looking sharply in almost as if ms cooke herself were a distant relative of the bostons there is nothing contrived about the other stories except their gleaming artfulness can there be anything left to write about old boston where , to drastically paraphrase the old jingle the lowells no longer look to the cabots nor the cabots to god , as used to be said that threeway arrangement moved away years ago to beverly farms and marblehead there can be , though the world changes vertiginously dying has become less a matter of leaving the world than of the world leaving you ms cooke s fading old bostonians share a puzzlement that lurks in our own more universal calendars in twa corbies , billy returns to beacon hill from his suburban retirement community he is to babysit for his brother tad while gay , his sisterinlaw , goes for her cancer verdict tad has become mentally a child after a terrible fall billy takes him for a walk , stranding him deliberately while crossing a truck route miraculously tad is not hit the bleak purpose was to forestall the looming horror of a helpless brother with no one to care for him neither billy nor we need to be told what gay s doctors had discovered that night billy interrupts her as she is about to jump out the window and this was how , having failed to do in my brother , i saved my sisterinlaw s life , then brushed my teeth and went to bed in the morning i went home to more familiar ground and left them as they were it is terrifying stoicism chillier than moral evil , it is moral solitude other beacon hill stories portray an equivalent bleakness , redeemed because ms cooke looks at it from inside , not outside if she wrote without sympathy , her coldness would not entangle us if she wrote without coldness , her sympathy would have no bite nowhere is the balance kept better than in the title story the sargents are moving from beacon hill to frog pond village \( billy lives there

as drama , it s a little thin , but the 75 minutes of the devil s music the life and blues of bessie smith contain everything you look for in a celebratory wake , including the palpable spirit of the deceased smith , the great blues diva and legendary bawdy mama , died after an automobile crash in 1937 , and the play begins on the day of her burial , her memory invoked by her piano player , pickle , portrayed here as a sweet and deferential man by terry walker but it is n't long before the singer herself , in the commanding person of miche braden , appears as she did a week earlier , performing for a blacksonly crowd at an afterhours buffet flat in memphis the show takes the form of smith s reminiscence , punctuated frequently with song , and ms braden , a large , agile woman in a white fur and clingy red dress , fills the stage immediately with the sex and selfknowledge that made smith as formidable a woman as she was a talent in a performance perfectly suited to the tiny , lowceilinged auditorium of theater 3 , one of the city s most claustrophobic theater spaces , ms braden fills every molecule of the airspace with the mordant joy of the blues sparring with mr walker \( who is joined onstage by a bass player , jimmy hankins , and a saxophonist , pierre andr \) in the mildly pandering manner david letterman uses with paul schaffer , and perennially in search of a bottle , she has the air of a woman who knows that her place is at the center of attention and on a set designed by matthew maraffi as a living room cozily prepared for a latenight party , she makes the audience feel less like paying customers than like invited guests the script , by angelo parra , skates through the biographical details of smith s life with a boozy swagger we learn , in frequently scatological and sometimes strained southern vernacular , of her performer s impulse as a child in tennessee , where she grew up as one of seven children in a oneroom shack , raised largely by an older sister after her parents died we learn about her first gig , in a traveling show that also employed her brother clarence , a musician and dancer , as well as the blues queen she learned from and would eventually eclipse in notoriety , ma rainey they called her the mother of the blues , ms braden says with a deep chuckle and a swig of gin well , the mother of the blues done stepped aside for your empress of the blues , thank you very much we learn about her rapid ascent to stardom , through recordings her first one , the alberta hunter and lovie austin song down hearted blues , sold 780 , 000 copies in 1923 and touring gigs , work that gave her the clout \( she was born with the gumption \) to spit in the eye of the white establishment we follow her hedonistic celebrity trip through the roaring twenties \( prohibition did n't bother me none \) her seesaw marriage , which erupted in betrayal and an ugly custody fight over an adopted son and finally , the decline of her career with the rise of swing over all , it s a primer that keeps the chronology straight and clear but leaves the emotional depth to the music the attitude throughout is that of a tough individual who is never less than daring and who has come though her travails with her confidence intact and even horrifying scenarios , like smith s being stabbed in a bar brawl or confronting a whiterobed mob of klansmen , are rendered as amusing anecdotes and delivered by ms braden with a snort and a smirk the moment intended as the narrative climax the courtordered loss of her son is deeply sentimental it works only because it spurs a stunningly fraught a cappella rendition of i ai n't got nobody by ms braden , which at the performance i saw left her and much of the audience in tears and the singing , of course , is the heart of the show the 14 songs include smith s signature numbers , like down hearted blues , gimme a pigfoot and the raunchy kitchen man blues , delivered gleefully to leave no doubt about the metaphorical implications of sausages and shellfish ms braden does n't have a huge voice she battles , unsuccessfully , at times , with the musicians but it is strong and sure , and if it does n't quite match smith in its bruising timbre \( whose does \? \) , it is unerringly melodic she s working from her own arrangements here , and they are terrific , in particular in a jaunty , almostbutnotquite rollicking taint nobody s bizness if i do and in a rousing rb version of the st louis blues , which turns into a highly charged call and response between singer and saxophonist the number is a set piece , and it exhibits the same showstopping sense of theatrical moment that the director , joe brancato , brought to his previous show , cobb otherwise , for the most part , mr brancato has wisely made room for ms braden to strut her stuff trying to tell bessie smith what to do was never a good idea the devil s music the life and blues of bessie smith by angelo parra directed by joe brancato sets by matthew maraffi lighting jeff nellis costumes by curtis hay musical arrangements , miche braden production stage manager , alicia edwards assistant stage manager , allison mitchell associate producers , timothy haskell and christopher joy presented by the melting pot theater company , larry hirschhorn , artistic director darren press , managing director , by special arrangement with the penguin repertory company at theater 3 , 311 west 43rd street , third floor , clinton with miche braden \( bessie \) , terry walker \( pickle \) , jimmy hankins and pierre andr \( musicians \)

a root canal should cost more than 50 le loi knows this now he did n't know it on the february morning when he and his toothache walked into a tiny dental office in chinatown seven people were already waiting in line when he arrived he riffled through magazines while he waited none were written in his native vietnamese , so he looked at the pictures the dentist a dr chow nghe , young , tall and quiet finally ushered mr loi into an even smaller side room with two dental chairs no diplomas or cheery pictures on the walls no rubber gloves no dental assistant , either dr nghe was efficient , though , and he finished the root canal in 10 minutes he then sent mr loi out with one instruction , call me when you feel bad mr loi felt bad at least a dozen times in the next two months each time , he paid 30 in cash and dr nghe shoved a gauzy substance into the side of his cheek to numb the pain then one morning in april , mr loi s face blew up my face was so fat , i could talk just a little , he said somehow i knew i was about to die this time , instead of taking the train to chinatown , he ran to the emergency room of new york methodist hospital in park slope had he waited a couple of hours , doctors told him , the infection probably would have killed him the neglected infection in his mouth had created an abscess in his neck and jaw , and doctors had to lance a section of his neck several times to reduce the swelling they also performed two surgeries on his jaw and kept him for 13 days mr loi said that during all that time he felt scared , but mostly he felt betrayed all he wanted was a cheap dentist , preferably one who knew vietnamese or at least looked familiar but he did n't get a dentist he got an impostor dr chow nghe , also known as dr chieu ngai , was actually a 28yearold chinese native named feng ni , who had had a little dentistry training in china but had no dental license there or here what mr ni had was an uncle who was a doctor , who had retired several years earlier mr ni inherited the equipment , and instead of closing the practice and selling the chairs , he decided to fill them demand made it profitable and he played the part , examining mouths and and performing oral surgeries mr loi was not even the first patient mr ni had injured with his untrained hands he was merely the one whose hospitalization exposed mr ni for a fraud and creepy though the story is , mr ni s arrest never made the major papers turns out a flybynight dentist is remarkably unremarkable by the city s criminal standards but then again , this is new york , city of impostors perhaps more than any other place , new york is where people come to reinvent themselves , to become freer or more successful occasionally , someone becomes wrapped up in the city s celebrity and plays social poseur , telling stories about being a son of steven spielberg , a cousin of a rockefeller now and then , people pretend they have ordinary if responsible jobs like driving subway trains or noble jobs like teaching elementary school students some are even serial impostors , switching fake careers every few years one of the youngest fugitives ever sought by the federal bureau of investigation was a bronxborn con man named frank abagnale jr , who spent five years in the 1960 s writing 25 million in hot checks and masquerading as an airline pilot , a pediatrician , a lawyer and a sociology professor \( having served four years for fraud , mr abagnale now often speaks at the fbi s national academy a movie about his criminal exploits , based on his autobiography , is in development at dreamworks studios \) not all impostors share mr abagnale s notoriety there are plenty of people just below the law s radar who play doctor , dentist , lawyer , police officer they carry touchedup licenses , bogus badges and stolen hospital scrubs , and they use these tools to perform abortions , rob houses and dispense drugs they dig out facial moles with scissors and offer free lip enlargements when tummy tucks go bad they place classified advertisements and set up shop in office buildings and storefronts they learn the jargon by hanging out in hospitals or with people who have the jobs they aspire to they get rooms of equipment and buy lab coats from thrift stores if arrested , they slip in and out of courtrooms , their remorse often earning them light sentences or probation freedom gives them a chance to settle somewhere else and try their act again many do who are these people \? what lives and careers do they most often assume \? where in the boroughs do they easily find work and how do they get away , get caught \? and why is it that impostors seem to thrive in new york more than in anywhere else in the world , as psychiatric experts and criminal investigators contend \?

sacramento , may 12 mitch kupchak was not sure he heard the date right , so the general manager of the los angeles lakers asked again april 1 \? yes , kupchak was told , april 1 the last time his team lost a basketball game i did n't mean to sound aloof or anything , he said i actually did n't know it was that long i mean , it s amazing how things came together april 1 , the day kobe bryant played only 11 minutes in a loss to the knicks because of a sore left foot he would rest the injury the next four games , watch the lakers move the ball and win without him , and return with the same renewed purpose as shaquille o'neal together , they canceled one of television s tensest dramas and began playing superior basketball again it took a little while , but we 're on a mission , o'neal said after he snatched 18 rebounds and bryant lit up sacramento for 36 points in a 10381 game 3 victory before a subdued crowd here on friday night we want to be where we were last year the lakers , who have won 14 straight games and are 60 in the playoffs , take a threegamestonone lead into game 4 of their western conference semifinal series against the kings on sunday at arco arena the lakers practiced today without bryant , who team officials said returned to los angeles to attend to an undisclosed personal matter he will be back for game 4 , they said with san antonio leading dallas , 31 , in their series , the two western powers seem to be playing a game of chicken with each other , about to collide in the conference finals some turnaround less than two months ago , the lakerskings matchup featured the dysfunctional defending champions against a daring young team about to take its cultlike following on the most improbable postseason ride but o'neal and bryant are flattening the fairy tale , driving the kings to elimination and perhaps chris webber to another franchise in the offseason when scot pollard , the kings' reserve center , said he was worried about stopping o'neal near the basket , webber , the freeagenttobe power forward , could not fathom pollard s capitulation i 'll guard shaq if i have to , he said it may come to that in the first two games , o'neal averaged 435 points , 205 rebounds , 5 blocked shots and 3 assists he became the first player in league history to record consecutive 40point , 20rebound performances in one series as we like to say , he s doing his thing , ron harper said the way he goes , our team goes surrounded on friday night every time he touched the ball , o'neal finished with 21 points and 18 rebounds but harper surmised that the kings were so worried about stopping o'neal they forgot to run the floor and employ the skills that sometimes make them the most pleasurable nba team to watch instead , bryant and the role players slowed the tempo and dissected the kings shaq has touted himself as superman and we 're the supporting cast , rick fox said so , i guess , if superman does n't get you , the super friends will no one is exactly sure how a seasonlong soap opera transformed into a saturday morning cartoon in less than two months but there are obvious reasons bryant rested a sore left foot for 10 days in early april moving the ball on offense , helping and talking more on defense , the lakers went 40 without him they resembled less a frenetic showtime team and more a cerebral halfcourt team early in the year , we got guys out there trying to make the allstar team , highlight plays , harper said now , it gets down to , throw it in , pound them , throw it out , get it back into shaq , and we just play all those old goals are out now fox said look back at the final stretch when kobe was able to watch the team play without him and come back and infuse himself into our offense with a different attitude , a different approach to making his teammates better it showed us where his mind was on top of that , the defense just got better and better in the playoffs , you just develop a better understanding of your opponent we 've been taking away what teams like to do and been holding that energy for 48 minutes o'neal s improved physical condition has also helped after taking criticism about his weight personally earlier in the season , he has acknowledged he was not in top shape for much of the regular season i need to go on a power diet this summer and come back into a camp lighter , he said on friday night i do n't know how much i weigh right now , but i feel in shape fox said o'neal had spent extra hours working on his cardiovascular conditioning the past two months , resulting in better lateral movement and more blocked shots on defense last year he was sensational , harper said last year he was in better shape , much better shape he s now where he was the return of derek fisher also proved to be invaluable fisher , known for taking charges , finding the open man and making 3pointers , missed the first 62 games with a stress fracture in his right foot photo

it is one of the great names in american sports when visiting teams wheezed their way through a football game in denver , they always had that name to remind them of their predicament , 5 , 280 feet above sea level mile high stadium who would tamper with a civic treasure like that name \? something called the invesco funds group has paid 60 million for advertising and 60 million for the naming rights to the new stadium alongside the historic old dump , which is soon to be demolished however , in one of the great comebacks in sports history , mayor wellington e webb lobbied to retain the name , and on wednesday the denver post announced that it would call the new place mile high stadium the community at large thinks of this as mile high , new mile high or the new stadium , the post s editor , glenn guzzo , said in this case , the community s terminology is familiar , positive and clear the broncos will play their first exhibition in the new joint a week from tomorrow the club has taken the money and will refer to the place as invesco field at mile high , but the mayor and the newspaper are having none of it my position is that everything in life is too unsettled , the mayor said last fall utility companies want to deregulate with phone companies , you do n't know who s handling your calls att , mci , sprint , whoever banks change names so fast , the names on your checks do n't correspond to who owns the bank so for me , why would you sell an identifiable icon , even for millions of dollars \? we 're a western city , a new city that does n't have many icons once they 're gone , they 're gone invesco , whose ownership is dutch and british but which has a headquarters in denver , is not amused but look at it this way the taxpayers paid 75 percent of the 400 million construction cost of the stadium they have a stake in how their tax dollars are invested besides , by refusing to go along with the grubbiness of naming rights , the civic leaders of denver could be saving the broncos and the national football league from a great deal of embarrassment if that financial company goes belly up the nfl has been bestowing the kiss of death upon naming rights lately talk about parity 3 of the 12 sponsors that paid to have their names hawked have gone out of business the miami dolphins are playing in pro player stadium \( which should have remained joe robbie stadium \) , even though pro player , a garment manufacturer , has tapped out the super bowl champs , the baltimore ravens , are playing in psinet stadium even though that dotcom marvel crashed and burned this spring and the 2000 super bowl champs , the st louis rams , now play in the generic dome at america s center , ever since twa was taken over by another airline no matter what the invesco weasels say , there is a history of resisting inappropriate names some papers do not refer to the nicknames of the baseball teams from cleveland and atlanta because they demean american indians when the mets play in san diego , their radio broadcasters refer to the old name of jack murphy stadium rather than the new corporate name , whatever it is this gesture honors their colleague , bob murphy , and his late brother , jack , who was a civic treasure , if you can imagine a sports columnist being so highly regarded college football bowl games get new sponsors all the time , but newspapers freely decline to pay homage to the piggly wiggly orange bowl or whatever its full name is bad taste is everywhere in sports the university of oregon spent 250 , 000 that could have been better spent on steroids for the players to promote its quarterback for the heisman trophy the rubes paid for a banner facing madison square garden and penn station , not knowing that hardly anybody in new york cares about college football i'm taking my cue from the mayor and the denver post and a businessman , john hickenlooper , and ralph nader , all of whom urged the people of denver to resist citizens everywhere when corporate weasels try to rename yankee stadium or the next fenway park or dodger stadium or soldier field , it s time for all of us to emulate the old crank in the movie network i want you all to open the windows and lean out and shout mile high stadium it s still a wonderful name photo the logo for denver s new football stadium \( associated press \)
one afternoon , when i had been reading elizabeth bishop for several hours , i wrote two words down on a piece of paper birthright and sightlines what was her birthright \? well , she was born in worcester , mass her father died when she was 8 months old , and when she was 5 , her mother entered a mental institution she was reared by two sets of grandparents the first , more loving ones were in nova scotia the second , both wealthier and chillier , took her back to massachusetts bishop described her birthright at its bleakest in the autobiographical story the country mouse , where , days before her seventh birthday , she stares at three grown strangers in panic and thinks 'you are you and you are going to be you forever' it was like coasting downhill , this thought , only much much worse , and it quickly smashed into a tree why was i a human being \? what about her sightlines , then , the spaces she lived in as a writer and what she could see there were things clear from a distance or just close up \? what obstructed the view , and could it be adjusted \? she found her sightlines by choice and temperament and they let her claim another birthright , a world of travel where human grief and need subside before or melt into landscapes \( brazil , nova scotia , florida , new england \) , railroads , sidewalks , empty buildings , animals , pictures and statues \( bad art inspired some of her best poems , just as the dreariest characters inspired some of chekhov s best prose \) then there are all the objects we thoughtlessly call inanimate toys , clocks , teakettles , stoves and , most of all , maps maps were her blueprints , not just for travel but for psychic freedom and invention her poems do what she praises the artist joseph cornell for doing in his works , those hexahedrons of wood and glass filled with every kind of small object minimal , incoherent fragments the opposite of history , creator of ruins , out of your ruins you have made creations theatre of the spirits objects putting the laws of identity through hoops putting the laws of identity through hoops is my credo for the millennium bishop spent a lifetime imagining herself into distant identities and taking on unlikely forms merging into landscapes rather than dominating them how do writers and readers do this today , where our sightlines are skewed by habit , vanity , anxiety , fear , anger and narrowmindedness that sees itself as rigor or boldness \? all of this comes into play whenever the claims of other traditions and identities arise and by other i mean any one that we have not been taught to respect and love , or have not yet found on our own it is time now for a few of those canonwar slogans prefaced by the words why must i read \? why must i read the literature of victimized minorities \( also known as specialinterest groups \) or of dead white men \? what is all of this ethnic studies , gender studies , queer theory and postcolonial theory \? for backup add some ostensibly devastating oneliners like this well , if there s a shakespeare of the zulus , i 'd certainly like to read him my tone makes some of my opinions clear i know next to nothing about zulu literature , but i assume it is oral , which means that there certainly might be a homer of the zulus in any case there is no shakespeare of the united states when did that last stop anyone from studying american literature \? it was not considered a respectable field until several decades into the 20th century , after a lot of fuss and furor why has there been such an insistent call for an expanded vision of literature , from the western world to the east , south and north , including oral as well as written works \? because so many of the west s literary custodians failed to do what they taught us literature demands they failed to extend their intellectual and imaginative capacities past familiar boundaries , to study worlds so unfamiliar that at first they were confusing or forbidding and perhaps demanded new kinds of study it is only human to feel nervous and suspicious at first can you trust those finely honed judgments and instincts you are so proud of \? how do you make your presence felt \? all readers are tourists we want to make sense of what we see and hear , to find the balance between what is unknown and what we can call ours and here is the place for another canonwar truism is n't it likely that a white heterosexual american man will feel displaced , somewhat alienated , while reading a novel written by , say , a korean lesbian \?

this week the brady act , which requires background checks for gun buyers , received its most comprehensive report card to date a study by the justice department shows that background checks by the fbi , as well as by state and local agencies , have barred criminals from acquiring guns hundreds of thousands of times praise for the law s performance tempered by a proposal that would weaken it came from none other than attorney general john ashcroft , who as a senator had long received campaign contributions from the national rifle association in appreciation of his stance against gun control but truly clamping down on gun crime would require more legislative action the permanent version of the brady act , which mandates background checks before purchases of handguns and long guns from federally licensed dealers , took effect on nov 30 , 1998 since then , background checks have tripled nationwide of the more than 16 million checks triggered by prospective gun buyers in 1999 and 2000 , 357 , 000 resulted in rejections twothirds of those because of indictments or convictions for felonies the brady act has also aided police in tracking criminals who use false identities and in fighting crime after the fact the justice department s study includes results from half a dozen states that use the background checks to find suspects on outstanding warrants virginia led with 775 arrests last year , a whopping 30 percent of the state s 2 , 568 rejections mr ashcroft has vowed that federal prosecutors would reinforce this practice by arresting people who act illegally by trying to buy guns despite praising the impact of the law , mr ashcroft has proposed disabling this powerful crimefighting tool by deleting the information generated by background checks from national databases after one business day rather than the current 90 days he claims that the longer period somehow impinges on privacy , yet there are no such strict limits on how long other agencies and organizations including the internal revenue service , the census bureau , registries of motor vehicles or even private creditrating firms may hold onto similar , voluntarily provided information in its current form , the brady act seeks to keep guns out of the hands of criminals , leading to less crime , the law s backers hope , and fewer guns in households but looking at the data from 1999 and 2000 separately reveals a possibly troubling undercurrent applications to buy guns from federally licensed dealers fell by 11 percent from one year to the next , but the number of applications rejected after background checks fell even faster , by 25 percent , and the percentage of those rejections that were based on felonies shrank by 23 percent a benign interpretation of these trends would be that fewer people felt the need to obtain guns as victimization by violent crime posted a record decline across the nation , and that criminals were deterred from applying for guns through registered dealers lest they be caught up in the background checks mandated by the brady law but there is a more sinister interpretation as well criminals may be finding new ways to buy guns indeed , an estimated 20 to 40 percent of guns are sold legally without background checks , at gun shows and other events not covered by the brady law whether bought at a specialty store or a trade fair , a gun is still a deadly weapon congress clearly needs to close this loophole in order to maintain the brady act s longterm benefits
phoenix , july 10 for many of them , the last straw was his vote against president bush s tax cut package yet while some arizona republicans were content to complain in letters to local newspapers , others decided more forceful action was necessary in that spirit , the recall john mccain committee was formed here last month the small group of conservatives want to drive the threeterm senator mccain , the state s most popular public figure , out of office through a rigorous process provided by the arizona constitution we 're very serious , and we 're very determined , said marcia j regan of mesa , ariz , who is helping promote the effort people are so angry with him mr mccain dismissed the effort as a movement that reflected only a small number of voters , judging by statewide polls that consistently show his approval rating is highest among arizona s leading political figures i'm not concerned , mr mccain said in an interview from washington still , the effort comes as republicans are struggling to keep the moderate and conservative wings of the party together and functioning the recent shift of senator james m jeffords of vermont from republican to independent was the most notable illustration of tension but there are examples , including disagreements over one of mr mccain s hallmark issues , campaign finance reform , now under debate in the house in a letter sent last week to 1 , 200 republican precinct leaders across arizona that was curious for its timing , mr mccain explained his position on that issue and others but he also pleaded for greater tolerance for those republicans who occasionally dissent from one or another policy position and promised not to leave the party while some republican leaders , like robert fannin , chairman of the arizona republican party , defended the letter as a routine gesture while congress considers a number of complicated issues , mr mccain s opponents described it as damage control in response to the recall movement i'm concerned , obviously , about communicating with people in my state , which is why i wrote the letter , mr mccain said but i'm very pleased with my high approval ratings , which by all measurable standards , are the highest of any politician in the state poll results aside , ms regan and other organizers of the recall say a growing number of arizona conservatives have grown disenchanted with mr mccain on several key issues , including his support for campaign finance reform , his efforts to close the gunshow loophole on gun purchases and his opposition to the administration s tax cut plan he has totally disappointed us , said jerry clingman , an electrician and cochairman of the recall effort ms regan , 43 , who describes herself as a stayathome mother , said all through the clinton years , congress passed tax cuts only for the president to veto them we finally get a republican president who favors tax cuts , what all republicans have been waiting for , and senator mccain does n't support him that s what really infuriates us arizona conservatives are also angry with mr mccain for not joining mr bush in a recent visit to the state yet playing host to senator tom daschle of south dakota , the senate majority leader , at his ranch near sedona in early june although mr mccain insisted the meeting at his ranch was purely social , it started rumors among conservatives that he was bolting the party it seems like he is doing everything he can to stick his thumb in the president s eye , mr clingman said of mr mccain he ought to be on the same side , instead of opposing everything for the recall effort to succeed , the committee needs to collect several hundred thousand voter signatures by oct 16 and have them verified by the arizona secretary of state then a special election would be held for mr mccain and any other candidate who can collect the same required number of valid signatures it is a daunting challenge , one ms regan said had generated no help from the republican party or national leaders who opposed mr mccain on key issues , like senator mitch mcconnell of kentucky , an ardent opponent of campaign finance reform nor does history offer much hope while other arizona politicians have faced recall efforts , including gov jane dee hull last year , none in recent memory have forced an election , said mary jo kief , an official in the secretary of state s office mr fannin predicted the effort against mr mccain would not go very far randall gnant , a republican and president of the state senate , described the recall as much ado about nothing , led by socalled republicans who eschew the notion of a big tent in any case , the first test is the signature collection it is uncertain how many are required either 349 , 269 , which represents 25 percent of voters in the last senate election , in 2000 , when john kyl , another republican , won or 253 , 820 , which is 25 percent of those who voted when mr mccain last ran , in 1998 the state constitution is ambiguous , so the secretary of state s office has asked the arizona attorney general , janet napolitano , for an interpretation whatever the number , mr mccain s opponents , who have already staged several protests statewide to generate support , have vowed to press on , an effort that mccain said would not bother him in the least recalls are just a fact of life in arizona , mr mccain said , adding , my approval numbers would be going down instead of up if i have suffered any kind of damage photos marcia regan , above , says conservatives in arizona are angry that senator john mccain has at times strayed from the republican party line jerry clingman calls the senator a disappointment \( photographs by scott troyanos for the new york times \)
london , april 20 demonstrating that it can outstrip rivals even as a broad slowdown batters the mobile phone industry , nokia of finland reported firstquarter earnings today that put it on a very short list technology companies that have not disappointed investors ericsson of sweden failed to make the list it posted a loss , said it would eliminate 12 , 000 more jobs and warned that its business was unlikely to improve any time soon the contrasts between the companies , two of europe s largest telecommunications equipment makers , have perhaps never been so great nokia managed to gain market share without sacrificing profit at a time when the whole sector was on the defensive , while ericsson struggled with red ink , and not just in its problemriddled handset division , and experienced shrinking margins shrink in its historically strong telecommunications infrastructure business when it goes right for a technology company , it can go very , very right , said stuart o'gorman , director of technology investments at henderson global investors , which owns both nokia and ericsson shares when it goes wrong , it can be disastrous ericsson is rapidly playing out the latter chain of events , investors say weary of attempts by kurt hellstrom , the chief executive , to reverse the company s slide , some are calling for his resignation ericsson really needs a change of management , said edwin protheroe , a fund manager with aberdeen asset management , who called ericsson the european lucent , referring to the recent stumbles of lucent technologies with ericsson s customers buying less and paying more slowly as they nurse wounds from the general industry slowdown , analysts say , ericsson has been burning through cash at a worrying pace ericsson has consumed as much cash to finance operations in the first quarter of 2001 as it required in all of 2000 , according to brant thompson of j p morgan chase we 've watched lucent and motorola turn to banks to help fund their businesses , mr thompson said ericsson is getting closer to finding itself in a similar situation moreover , ericsson has advanced its customers large amounts to finance new mobile phone networks , a practice called vendor financing that has brought trouble to other technology companies and is one that ericsson has used liberally , analysts and investors said shares in ericsson fell 14 percent today , while nokia shares rose 32 percent roland klein , an ericsson spokesman , said that the company s loans of roughly 3 billion euros \( 27 billion \) to customers were in line with those of competitors and that the company had arranged for banks to refinance many of those loans and take most of the risk off ericsson s shoulders mr klein acknowledged that the company was concerned about its cash flow and said that it had made a series of moves to cut costs , including today s job cuts , 10 , 000 more announced previously , a recent agreement to farm out handset production to flextronics and talks with the sony corporation on joint development of new highspeed digital phones none of these moves will take effect fast enough to stem the losses that the company now expects to incur in the second quarter , after losing 35 billion swedish kronor \( 3468 million \) in the first three months of the year , excluding a onetime gain from selling shares in juniper networks sales for the first quarter declined 5 percent from the period in 2000 , to 559 billion kronor \( 55 billion \) a general economic downturn and an abruptly slower telecom sector are affecting our customers as well as us , mr hellstrom said in a statement many operators are postponing their investments operating in the same environment , nokia managed to increase its already dominant market share in mobile phone handsets by 2 percentage points , to 35 percent , in the first quarter motorola was second , with 14 percent , and ericsson third , with 9 percent and nokia continued to shrink ericsson s lead in infrastructure , raising its share to 18 percent from 12 percent last year ericsson has 30 percent nokia s profit for the first quarter totaled 975 million euros \( 874 million \) , up 94 percent from the period last year , on sales of 8 billion euros \( 72 billion \) , up 22 percent we have to keep our eyes very clearly on the race track , so as not to make any mistakes when the speed is so high , said lauri kivinen , a nokia spokesman nokia has not escaped completely from the economic mud bogging down its competitors it said its margins will probably shrink this year because of softening sales and widespread discounting , though it stood by its forecast for worldwide mobile phone sales of 450 million to 500 million units , a figure some analysts say is too high photo kurt hellstrom , chief executive of ericsson , announced a loss and additional job cuts at a news conference in stockholm yesterday \( agence francepresse \) \( pg c2 \)
the newly combined aol time warner began a series of steps yesterday meant to streamline the company s farflung operations , including the elimination of at least 2 , 000 jobs the job cuts representing slightly more than 2 percent of the company s 85 , 000 workers come less than two weeks after america online , the no 1 internet provider , completed its acquisition of time warner , one of the giants of traditional media the cuts come atop the 400 jobs the company said last week that it would eliminate at its cable news network , cnn besides cutting jobs , aol time warner also intends to shut down or sell its 130 warner brothers retail stores if the stores are sold , the roughly 3 , 800 people who work in them would become employees of another company if the stores are simply shut down , those jobs would be eliminated in an interview yesterday , richard d parsons and robert w pittman , the company s cochief operating officers , said the 2 , 025 jobs certain to be cut would come from units that include the america online internet operation , the new line cinema film studio , the time inc magazine company and the warner music group , as well as at the company s headquarters a company spokesman said the layoffs were announced internally yesterday the various moves are part of a paroxysm of reorganizations and executive shifts meant to align time warner s traditional media units with america online s internet operations it is really about getting the company ready to take the next step , which means it was two separate companies and we want to get the redundancy out , mr pittman said yesterday we are going to move at a pace that we think no other company of our size moves on we are going to adopt 'quick , nimble , fast' as a corporate culture shelby coffey iii , president of the cnnfn financial news network , and bob furnad , president of cnn s headline news network , have announced their resignations teya ryan , a deputy to mr coffey , is taking over headline news , and ken jautz , who had been running the ntv news network in germany , is taking over cnnfn in addition , new line cinema s president , michael de luca , has resigned and been succeeded by toby emmerich , the head of new line s music division the wb network created a new president and chief operating officer position , which was filled by its head of advertising sales , jed petrick america online , which is planning a music subscription service , named a former top bertelsmann music executive , kevin conroy , as the head of its music operations in another shift of corporate culture , mr parsons and mr pittman said yesterday that almost all of aol time warner s remaining employees would be given stock options in a onetime move meant to give workers a feeling of responsibility for the new company employees who had been eligible for time warner s profitsharing programs will now receive additional stock options instead , a spokesman said , adding that the cash profitsharing programs would end in fact , up to 100 of the company s top executives will watch their cash paychecks actually shrink in favor of additional options america online has had a history from the beginning of always having every employee , at whatever level of the company , having a piece of the equity , having a stake in the future of the company and being tangibly rewarded on the basis of companywide performance , mr parsons said at time warner , i think in any given year anywhere from 3 to 5 percent of the total employee population traditionally got options , and that s more of a traditional model what we 're doing is , we 're moving now to where , literally , virtually every employee of the company will have a stake in the company christopher dixon , a media analyst for ubs warburg , said that the company s new initiatives , particularly the job cuts , were about what he had expected basically , this is cleaning house aol time warner is girding for action , mr dixon said the focus is to basically start with a clean sheet and build a company that takes advantage of the skill sets and experiences of the different players in terms of percentage of jobs lost , the unit that was hit hardest by layoffs was new line cinema , the troubled movie studio out of roughly 600 jobs , about 100 were cut in terms of sheer numbers , the unit that was hit hardest was america online , which lost 725 of its roughly 15 , 000 workers many of the jobs eliminated at america online overlapped with positions at time warner , the company said yesterday time inc , the magazine unit , lost 400 of its roughly 13 , 000 workers none of the cuts appeared to come among editorial employees rather , the reductions came in customer service and marketing units in a move that surprises few media experts , aol time warner also said that it had essentially shut down the entertaindomcom show business web site , merging it into warner brothers' other online operations and eliminating about 100 jobs out of about 11 , 000 total at warner brothers entertaindomcom s demise had been rumored in media circles for weeks while the company said that most of the cuts would be made immediately , one unit was granted a reprieve of sorts aol time warner said it would eliminate about 600 of warner music group s roughly 12 , 000 jobs , but said it would make those reductions mostly through attrition and by offering early retirement packages the company said about 100 employees at its manhattan headquarters had been let go because their jobs had become redundant the company said that a small number of additional cuts would be made through attrition at hbo , at the company s cable systems , at the wb network and at the turner cable networks the cuts are deep enough that they show that the company is willing to be aggressive in addressing costs and making earningspershare numbers , paul noglows , an analyst for j p morgan hq , said yesterday but they do n't appear to be so deep that they will impede growth for his part , mr pittman said , this is all about growth it s the reason for the merger starting from day 1 aol time warner would not comment on the financial effect of the job cuts , but the moves are likely to save the company hundreds of millions of dollars a year for instance , at a 150 , 000 average total cost per employee , a figure that some analysts said was reasonable , cutting 2 , 025 jobs would save almost 304 million photo shoppers walk past the warner brothers store on fifth avenue in the right photo are robert pittman , left , and richard parsons ,

garden city , ny , april 25 one woman seeking free health care at a manhasset hospital was rudely told to seek charity from a church a woman who asked huntington hospital about free treatment was transferred to the billing department , which advised her to seek medicaid and latinos had trouble getting answers to their questions , no matter which hospital they contacted those were among the findings released today by a long island health consumer advocacy group that surveyed seven hospitals five in nassau county and two in suffolk county and found that none consistently provided accurate information about their free care programs for the uninsured yet those hospitals , part of a web of 24 nonprofit and government hospitals on long island , each receive millions of dollars in annual property and sales tax benefits and state reimbursements for bad debt and charity care , according to the study , conducted by the nonprofit long island coalition for a national health plan the study s findings were first reported today in newsday the study , financed in part by the access project , a national initiative of the robert wood johnson foundation , did not accuse the hospitals of barring the uninsured or underinsured from medical care but it did say that they did not enunciate clearly enough that help was available all the hospitals have responded to the findings by making changes or promising to consider them but many hospital officials said today that the study was flawed because it did not credit the hospitals for the charity care they have provided for years and the investments they have made in other community services in 1999 , for instance , the 24 nonprofit and government hospitals delivered 125 million in uncompensated care despite losing a combined 100 million , said peter m sullivan , president and chief executive of the nassausuffolk hospital council the problem that the survey identified was in access to information , but not in access to health care , said dr lawrence scherr , director of the office of community health and public policy for the north shorelong island jewish health system but those who conducted the survey and other health care advocates said that failing to consistently inform people about available charity care is tantamount to withholding it they said the survey underscored a need for uniform state standards about how and how much charity care should be spent at a time when concerns about fair access to medical care are growing locally and around the nation people are slipping through the safety nets , said donna kass , who was a director of the study they do n't know that free care is available , even if they ca n't pay , and therefore they do n't seek needed care and they are not getting it under new york state law , nonprofit hospitals are considered charitable organizations , and so must provide some care for free but , ms kass said , hospitals are allowed to create their own freecare programs and decide how much to spend the study examined five hospitals in nassau north shore university hospital in manhasset , nassau university medical center in east meadow , long beach medical center , winthropuniversity hospital in mineola , and mercy medical center in rockville centre in suffolk , it surveyed good samaritan hospital medical center in west islip and huntington hospital surveyors made at least six phone calls and one visit to each hospital the surveyors included indigent community residents trained by experts , professional social welfare agency employees and church outreach workers , ms kass said the nassau university medical center , in east meadow , plans to increase training for telephone operators and has published a brochure , in spanish and english , on the hospital s medical financial aid policy , said richard b turan , the president and chief executive officer he said the hospital spent tens of millions on uncompensated care last year , contributing to a current 35 million deficit j ronald gaudreault , the president and chief executive of huntington hospital , said that all hospitals could perhaps improve on communication skills but , he added , to criticize hospitals for not taking care of their communities , i really think , is unfounded
issues of war and peace and death and life will hover over the national football league this year in a way that none of its players have experienced before this season will require adaptability who has it \? who can muster it \? the sept 11 terrorist attacks set the stage , forcing the league to postpone week 2 before returning to the field last sunday pro football schedules and schemes had been altered and the lives of players and coaches were affected leaguewide , doubly so for those who lost family and friends pro football coaches have always sought to grasp young men s minds and insist because the talent level across the league is comparable that unlocking that door is what builds championship teams but gaining that mental entry among today s batch of millionaires can be difficult the recent tragedy , however , coupled with the heatstroke death of korey stringer , has snapped several players into a firsttime warp of complete awareness one result is an opportunity for the best coaches in the nfl to garner the maximum effort from their teams , individually and collectively , by tapping into the players' search for leadership and for answers the coaches , simply , can accomplish that by leading the players will be part of a season filled with layers of raw emotions and distractions what teams , what players , what coaches are best suited to deal with that \? there were seven teams on sunday indianapolis , miami , cincinnati , jacksonville , san diego , denver and st louis that improved to 20 the flip side is that seven teams sank to 02 on sunday , the startling ones being minnesota and tennessee notice that the american football conference has six of those seven 20 teams notice that the super bowl champion baltimore ravens are not among them baltimore s 2110 loss at cincinnati dropped the ravens to a 11 record and must have the ravens wondering if what looked like a flake will turn into a blizzard when the ravens lost running back jamal lewis to a knee injury in the preseason , everyone wondered if it was an injury they could overcome baltimore opened by beating chicago , 176 , and ran the ball 30 times and passed it 30 times but in losing to the bengals , the ravens ran 20 times and passed 64 that is not a formula for winning , regardless of how dominating the baltimore defense thinks it can still be in neither of its games have the ravens totaled 65 rushing yards minnesota , seattle , detroit and new england are teams that join baltimore in trying to fix broken offenses in minnesota s 1710 loss at chicago on sunday , receiver cris carter made one catch for 13 yards in two games , receiver randy moss has not caught a touchdown pass that is a mystified offense in new england , the offense is miserable and looks headed for worse now that quarterback drew bledsoe is out at least two weeks because of internal bleeding suffered in a 103 loss to the jets indianapolis has had no such problems it has scored 87 points in two games no other team has scored 70 the st louis and denver offenses are clicking , denver s more so , averaging 345 points a game denver receiver rod smith \( a startling 23 catches , 277 yards and three touchdowns in two games \) is making sure that the broncos do not fret over the loss of the injured receiver ed mccaffrey when i go out there and play , smith said , they 're getting two for one now , ed and me , in one package and how about a word for defenses \? jacksonville and cincinnati are attempting to create a new order in the afc central with a jolt of defense jacksonville has allowed 9 points , cincinnati 27 the bengals ripped baltimore by forcing six turnovers , all of their points were set up off those turnovers and one turnover , in the fourth quarter , iced the victory when linebacker takeo spikes returned an interception 66 yards for a touchdown when talking about leadership , it is obvious that bengals coach dick lebeau through two games has found a way to reach the wayward bengals his tutoring and tinkering and the adequate quarterback play of jon kitna finally give the forlorn bengals hope thus far , the team that most appears to have its mind on track is miami what the dolphins have done by opening with victories over tennessee and oakland is boldy defeat the afc team with the best record last season \( tennessee , 133 \) and a representative in last season s afc championship game \( oakland \) couple an offense the improved quarterback jay fiedler , the sturdy running back lamar smith and the underrated receiver oronde gadsden with a swift , persistent defense that is superior in the secondary , and the dolphins appear ready for most challenges they play the explosive rams at st louis on sunday , so , there is no time for the defense to coast everybody knows that dave wannstedt used to be a defensive coordinator and that he is going to build his teams to win on defense , miami safety shawn wooden said about his coach this year that message has gotten across to everybody on this team dolphins safety brock marion said , everyone seems surprised that we were able to stand toetotoe with tennessee and oakland in a physical sense when did we not become a physical team \? the answer is late in recent seasons , as the dolphins kept manufacturing fast starts only to fizzle at the finish this is a new team with a new resolve , marion countered some of these teams that have started out floundering have to understand that no matter how good your reputation is , on every sunday you 've got to bring it especially , in these times , the mental game photo lamar smith has helped the miami dolphins get off to a 20 start with 147 yards rushing \( eliot j schechter allsport \)

bogot , colombia , may 17 their presence grew as colombia s drug war intensified in the 1990 s , with the united states hiring american pilots , radar operators , former army special forces trainers and other former military personnel to carry out important missions under private contracts known to only a few members of the united states congress , these specialists all working for american companies have flown spray planes and helicopters , trained and advised colombian military personnel , repaired hightech machinery and helped pave remote airfield runways supporters of private contractors say that , overall , the companies have completed important work while relieving key american military specialists who would otherwise have had to uproot from strategically significant regions but now questions are being raised in the american congress and even by colombian officials about the logic of relying on private companies for operations that are not open to public scrutiny americans working in colombia are constantly exposed to danger , critics note , with three american pilots killed since 1997 when their spray planes crashed also of concern to policy makers in washington and military officials here is whether the united states should be spending tens of millions of dollars annually on contractors when colombian officials say colombians could be trained to complete the same operations for much less money indeed , the largest of the companies operating in colombia , dyncorp of reston , va , a 14 billion company that has handled many tasks here in the last 10 years , was awarded a fiveyear , 170 million contract in 1998 , according to government reports american congressional aides familiar with dyncorp say the company s pilots can earn more than 100 , 000 a year conducting operations that colombian pilots could do for less than 40 , 000 a year when we get a contractor here , we always think we could probably get a colombian to do this , and a lot cheaper , said a highranking official in president andr s pastrana s administration who is familiar with contractors we can do it with a colombian company , and it would cost 60 percent less however , r rand beers , assistant secretary of state for international narcotics and law enforcement affairs , said finding qualified personnel in colombia is not always easy and going to the american military is not the catchall answer , since united states forces do not employ pilots for cropspraying or the mechanics and logistics experts needed for defoliation programs hiring private contractors , mr beers said , is often the best option , giving the government flexibility to hire for shortterm jobs while choosing from a pool of experienced companies that offer a range of services tailor made for places like colombia the need for such services is likely to increase as the united states invests 13 billion to destroy colombia s coca fields documents provided by congressional aides show that it is not uncommon for defoliation planes flown by americans and other contract pilots on defoliation missions to be hit by gunfire in fact , rebels or cocaine traffickers have hit ov10 planes flown by americans nearly 70 times since 1998 , though none were shot down , dyncorp records show then , in april , a peruvian fighter plane downed a private plane carrying missionaries from the united states after an american surveillance aircraft staffed by american contractors alerted the peruvians that the airplane might be suspicious because of where it was flying although the contractors employees of the aviation development corporation of montgomery , ala , and working under contract to the central intelligence agency apparently tried to call off the fighter from pursuing the missionary plane or firing on it , their efforts proved futile veronica bowers , a missionary , and her baby daughter were killed representative bill delahunt , a democrat from massachusetts who sits on the house international relations committee , said contract work in colombia must become more public to establish some transparency to ensure accountability with bipartisan support from other members of the committee , mr delahunt sponsored an amendment to a state department authorization bill that calls for detailed reports on contractors in colombia and for american workers to be replaced by colombians if and when qualified personnel are made available the legislation was approved wednesday in the house we do n't need , given the incident in peru and our experiences in latin america in the past , shadowy relationships where information is difficult to secure and where activities tend to be obscure , mr delahunt said some military experts note that contractors have fulfilled necessary and important missions since world war ii they tend to be highly trained often experienced former military men and women who offer expertise when the american military is stretched thin , said gabriel marcella , who teaches at the united states army war college and has written extensively about colombia s conflict these specialists , military experts say , can quickly fill posts in places like colombia without compromising american military commitments in other regions in many cases it s easier to do it with a contractor , said gen ed soyster , a retired general who is the spokesman for military professional resources inc , a virginia company that recently completed a contract with colombia s ministry of defense they can count on the right people without affecting the readiness of your forces to human rights groups and some policy makers in the united states congress , the use of contractors provides a way for the american government to deny or play down any responsibility if something goes wrong and some policy makers fear that , if colombia s conflict escalates , the use of contractors could grow what we 're seeing is the outsourcing of the war down there , said a senior republican aide in washington the state department gives lip service to colombian nationalization of the program , and so it is just more and more gringos , at more and more expense the state department has started to be more open about what contractors are doing in colombia , and its officials stress that american policy is to replace americans with colombians as soon as they are trained recent figures from the state department show that on any given day there are 160 to 180 american civilians in colombia working under contract with the state department , the department of defense or in social programs for the united states agency for international development dyncorp employs about 100 americans in colombia , as well as 100 colombians and thirdcountry nationals , according to the state department twelve americans rotate in and out to fly spray planes escort helicopters that accompany spray planes and searchandrescue helicopters are also staffed by american pilots and medics

trenton , april 13 the calls for peter g verniero to resign from the new jersey supreme court have come from almost every quarter republicans in the state senate , democrats in the state senate , the acting governor , civil rights groups , editorial writers but , as assembly speaker jack collins ponders an 11page letter from the senate judiciary committee calling for impeachment proceedings , voices of support for justice verniero are emerging and raising questions about the hearings that have presented the case against him two former state supreme court justices this week protested a portrait of justice verniero as the central villain in the racial profiling debate several people who have spoken with the court s current members say the justices are appalled by his treatment lawyers accustomed to defending clients note that the senate hearings were a political event , not a legal proceeding a trial , they point out , with defense counsel and crossexamination , would at least elicit responses to the charges that justice verniero ignored racial profiling by the state police when he was the state s attorney general and then gave deceptive testimony about it in his court confirmation hearings there are , his supporters say , at least two very different versions of mr verniero s treatment of racial profiling , each leading to a different conclusion as to whether his testimony at his confirmation hearings was honest , equivocal , slippery , mistaken or purposefully false in the first scenario , mr verniero shoved aside evidence given to him , withheld documents sought by federal civil rights investigators and kept news of the investigation carefully contained he acknowledged discrimination against minority motorists only when his court nomination was in the balance , and excused himself by saying he had only recently seen the damning evidence in the second , mr verniero s biggest offenses were na vet and inattention he was assured that racial profiling was not a problem his predecessor , deborah t poritz , now the state supreme court s chief justice , said claims to the contrary were based on junk science he may or may not have seen a few abbreviated sets of statistics that landed in the vast bureaucracy of the attorney general s office when the justice department undertook an investigation , he defended the state s interest by declining to surrender anything he was not legally obligated to produce the first version prevailed at the current hearings mr verniero perpetrated a huge injustice on our community , senator wayne r bryant , a democrat from camden , said after testifying this week the minority community wo n't feel vindicated until he is off the court and justice verniero has not received good reviews for his own 13 1 2hour defense i think he had every opportunity to explain himself i do n't have any question about that , said frank askin , the director of the constitutional litigation clinic at rutgers law school in newark i think it was a legitimate process but justice verniero s supporters say that if the accusations sound persuasive , it is partly because the committee members and lawyers all took prosecutorial roles nothing has been brought out from all the favorable evidence they had that would have supported verniero s version of the facts , said alan l zegas , a former president of the association of criminal defense lawyers of new jersey none was used except those portions that were bad for him so he was put in an unfair light , and i think that s wrong robert b reed , a former member of the bar association committee that screens judicial candidates , said , i did not get the impression that the conclusions resulted from any search for the truth mr reed , who was on the committee when it reviewed justice verniero , added that recent news coverage reflected a bias against the justice which i thought bordered on hysteria the judiciary committee investigation was undertaken to examine discrimination against black and hispanic motorists by the state police , and much of the testimony concerned evidence that minority drivers were stopped on the new jersey turnpike at rates far higher than that for whites the questioning focused on mr verniero s treatment of that evidence when he was attorney general from 1996 to 1999 then , in the 14th hour of justice verniero s testimony on march 28 , the committee chairman , senator william l gormley , accused him of misrepresenting that record when the committee considered his nomination in 1999 that charge became the basis of the committee s call for justice verniero s resignation , which was seconded by acting gov donald t difrancesco , and its letter this week urging mr collins to start impeachment proceedings the letter contends that mr verniero gave false statements about the status of the justice department s investigation and about when his department had begun collecting data about traffic stops and searches it also says he misled the judiciary committee at his confirmation hearings when he responded to a question of when he had become aware of that data and , in response to a written request from minority legislators in march 1999 , told them the statistics were not readily available the senior democrat on the committee , senator john a lynch , said the letter sets forth the undisputed facts concerning justice verniero s actions regarding racial profiling and his conduct during his confirmation to the supreme court but mr zegas said that justice verniero s general response that the evidence of racial profiling did not crystallize in my mind until 1998 was credible there s no reason to disbelieve that , given the testimony of his immediate subordinates , mr zegas said while current justices refuse to comment publicly , two former justices , marie l garibaldi and daniel j o'hern , said in a statement that we are not judges of the legislature or its proceedings , but we are concerned about the public impression of the character and integrity of our friend justice verniero has turned aside pleas that he resign , and maintains that he has answered every question truthfully his lawyer , robert a mintz , is writing a response to the committee s letter that he plans to deliver to mr collins on monday mr collins , a republican but not a friend of mr difrancesco s , responded coolly and said he would announce a decision next week he and the assembly are consumed by redistricting and , many legislators say , are not eager to take up impeachment finally , the assembly has only until may 15 to meet the impeachment time limit still , justice verniero will be judged again in 2006 , when his initial term expires and he must be reappointed and reconfirmed so far , a majority of the 25 republican senators have called for his resignation the 15 democrats in the senate opposed his nomination in 1999 photos new jersey state troopers , some who had recounted racial harassment by fellow troopers , listening to other testimony during hearings on racial profiling this week \( keith meyers the new york times \) \( pg b1 \) justice peter g

throughout history , horses both real and imaginary have been an unending source of fascination early man drew pictures of them on the walls of caves the greeks used one to trick the trojans for centuries , as a primary mode of transportation , horses have helped shape our notions of personal freedom and independence children \( of all ages \) still dream of owning a pony aarne anton sees the wooden , folkart horses he sells at his soho gallery fulfilling yet another psychological need for those who buy them his specialty is the handmade , oneofakind variety like the rocking horses or pull toys that fathers made for their young for generations these horses , he says , tap into our preoccupation with old things they are a reminder of a simpler time and , in their workmanship and longevity , an alternative to a culture enamored of massproduced ephemera as mr anton put it , they provide relief and comfort for people who earn their livelihood in stressful jobs a collection of his survivors , as he calls them , is on view in horses inspired folk art , an exhibition at his american primitive gallery , 594 broadway , near houston street , through sept 8 the show offers some 40 horses and drawings most of the works are from the 19th and 20th centuries a few are by contemporary selftaught artists prices range from 250 to 75 , 000 the tasteful lighting and careful placement of the horses around the compact secondfloor gallery make it seem like a child s fantasy of a playroom mr anton , 53 , says he more or less lucked into the folkart business in the 1970 s after attending the school of visual arts , where he studied painting and sculpture , he landed a job in a new york shop that made bases for sculptures , mainly works of tribal and primitive art \( hence the name of his gallery \) he also began to collect duck decoys in his travels around the country and , as a sideline , to sell them in the shop i was in a sense discovering folk art , which was not ever even mentioned in my arthistory classes , he said with the growing popularity of the decoys , mr anton soon found himself priced out of the market then , in 1978 , he bought his first horse , which he described as a lifesize metal sheetiron horse while driving along an interstate in florida , he spotted it sitting in a front yard the owner was only too happy to part with the horse , which , it turned out , had belonged to a blacksmith who had used it outside his shop as a kind of trade sign mr anton brought it back to new york and sold it to a collector , who told him he would be able to sell it for more money than i would have ever imagined asking for it after a similar experience with a carousel horse , which he bought at a country auction a short time later , mr anton made a second important discovery i saw the financial incentive in being a finder , or picker , of folk art and bringing it into the city , he said eleven years ago , he opened his own gallery he still displays a picker s enthusiasm for his work , traveling to auctions and flea markets for pieces that catch his eye the first person i have to please is myself , he said he looks for horses with their surfaces paint , fabric , details like stirrups or saddles largely intact , if not pristine , though the patina that comes from years of use can actually enhance their value , he said what really gets me excited , he said , is finding pieces that reveal the individuality of their makers it s not a matter of creating a realistic horse , he said i have had horses that have exaggerated features whether it s a curved neck or an elongated body or short legs that look more like a dog s i'm interested in the personal interpretation , a personal way of seeing , whether the person has an artistic background or is a farmer or a carpenter the horses in his show reflect those concerns a white , wooden swing horse has no legs it s just the body and the horse s head and neck , mr anton said it was thought to have hung from a tree or on a porch in nebraska some time between 1920 and 1940 but like most of the works in the show , it was by an unknown maker , hence little is known of its history a finely detailed , lifesize horse , which was probably used as a display in a tack shop in the late 19th or early 20th century , was found by an antiques dealer in a packing crate in the attic of a house mr anton recalled that when he acquired it , parts of the body had a hide cover stuffed with burlap , much of which had deteriorated he likened the experience of unpacking the horse to finding a mummy and not knowing what was underneath it an oddlooking horse on wheels is unusual because its origins are well established it was made in the last year by larry calkins , a selftaught artist from the state of washington it appears to be a pulltoy horse , mr anton said , but made in a sense nonfunctional because it s a flattened form , covered with fabric with horsehair on it mr anton admits that the stories about the pieces their histories , how and where they turned up appeal to the collector in him , but in a world in which provenance can be all important , folk art is an exception none of these artists are household names , he said knowing the story , he says , is not what attracts him to the pieces or , for that matter what sells them i do n't know the story for most of the pieces in the show , he said and quite frankly , he prefers the mystery photos horsy set at the american primitive gallery in soho , from left , dr minefield s horse of good intentions by larry calkins , a contemporary artist a horse probably used in a tack shop at the turn of the 19th century a horse swing from nebraska , circa 1920 s1940 s \( photographs from american primitive gallery \)
washington , jan 5 with help from western states and prominent mining and drilling industry representatives , the republicans and their allies are drawing battle plans in the hopes of blunting or reversing much of what president clinton has sought to accomplish in a blizzard of lastminute orders on environmental policy those orders included new rules announced today that would put millions of acres in national forests off limits to development well beyond that , the republicans and industry groups intend to pursue avenues resolutely blocked by the clinton administration , most important by seeking to open federally owned land in alaska and other western states to oil drilling , mining , logging and other activities in washington today , ari fleischer , the spokesman for presidentelect george w bush , said mr bush would closely review each and every lastminute order that mr clinton issues none of the orders could be reversed by mr bush unilaterally , and the task of seeking a reversal in congress could prove timeconsuming as republican lawmakers monitor the path of the lawsuits challenging mr clinton s authority on several fronts , some members of congress and industry officials expect the bush administration to appoint officials at the justice department and other agencies who would coordinate a fullthrottled attack against the lastminute clinton environmental measures some fights have already been joined in the courts , including a lawsuit by the mountain states legal foundation , where gale a norton , mr bush s choice to become interior secretary , began her legal career the organization , based in denver , has filed a lawsuit challenging mr clinton s unilateral designation in the past year of more than half a dozen new national monuments in his own public comments , mr bush has been cautious when it comes to the environment , emphasizing the importance of striking a balance between conservation and economic development but in laying plans for the future , his transition team is reaching out directly to the industries and advocates that felt most aggrieved by mr clinton s tenure , and that have made clear there is much they want to see undone a list of the 38member advisory group on interior department issues provided by a bush transition official reads in part like a who s who of representatives of affected industries it includes w henson moore , a former deputy secretary of energy who is now chairman of the american forest and paper association the representatives of various mining and energy trade groups and top officials from companies like general electric it s very clear that the extractive industries were out of favor with the old administration , said jack gerard , the president of american mining association and a member of a bush advisory group mr gerard said he looked forward to the departure of a clinton administration consumed by an extreme ideology that drove extreme solutions representative james v hansen of utah and senator frank murkowski of alaska , the new republican chairmen of the congressional natural resource committees , both vowed today to subject mr clinton s forestprotection plan to review , with an eye to overturning it in the congress if the federal courts do not do so first republicans objected most vigorously to the part of the administration s road ban that extended protection to the sprawling tongass national forest in alaska , which had been excluded from earlier proposals in deference to republican concerns about the effect on the timber industry there some democrats and environmental groups are so alarmed at the prospect of big reversals that they are scrambling to head off the emerging republican efforts , first by trying to block ms norton s nomination clinton and gore were like the goalies who stopped nearly every shot to weaken environmental protection , and now those goalies have been pulled , said daniel j weiss , the political director of the sierra club even before mr bush takes office , the early wrangling has begun to elevate the environmental arena to the status of an important battleground in a contest over the direction a bush white house will take in a letter to mr bush , representative hansen offered an ambitious eightpage agenda for action , recommending that the new administration make it a priority to correct the misguided direction the clinton administration has taken in their attempt to manage our natural resources but another republican , representative sherwood boehlert of new york , was among those who cautioned against giving too much credence to the calls for any kind of upheaval on the environment the congress is a pretty centrist institution these days in both the house and the senate , mr boehlert said , and you 're going to see resistance to any significant change in direction many republicans are watching the lawsuits as they wend their way through federal courts , hoping that rulings on whether mr clinton exceeded his authority will bolster their cause the mining association , headed by mr gerard , filed suit last month in an attempt to block an interior department rule set to take effect on inauguration day that would guarantee any future interior secretary a veto over mining activity , even when it had congressional approval among mr bush s other advisers , said mark rubin , a top official of the american petroleum institute and a member of the group advising the transition team , many are particularly eager to see the forestprotection plan undone because it would bar the oil industry and others from getting access to the vast areas of public lands that mr clinton is seeking to protect from development in the courts , the challenges to mr clinton s recent orders including one by the state of idaho to the forestprotection plan could get a boost if mr bush s appointees at the justice department decide not to defend mr clinton s moves for his part , mr bush has signaled that a priority will be to move ahead on an energy policy that would give energy companies more freedom to explore for oil and gas in the united states in that effort , his biggest task would be to win congressional approval for a plan to open alaska s arctic national wildlife refuge to drilling , a goal that republicans have pressed since the late 1980 s but one that some experts say is within reach if mr bush stays attentive to the mission i 'd be very surprised if you see any major effort from the white house to roll back what the clinton administration has done , said jerry taylor , director of natural resources at the cato institute , a research and advocacy group in washington that is opposed to most federal regulation but i think you 'll see bush focusing like a laser beam on opening western lands for development , not just in alaska chart map a closer look preserving forests an order issued yesterday by president clinton declares nearly onethird of federally owned forest

washington , april 25 with congress heading toward a decision about how much to scale back his 16 trillion tax cut , president bush met with moderate democratic senators today in search of support but made no apparent headway acknowledging explicitly that he was unlikely to get his full plan passed , mr bush pressed ahead as negotiators from the house and senate staged a brief public meeting to kick off their effort to find a middle ground between the budget plan passed by the house , which provided for mr bush s full tax cut , and the plan adopted by the senate , which reduced the tax cut to 12 trillion over the next decade but the real negotiations are not so much between the house and senate as among the white house , the republican leadership in the senate and moderate democrats who might be persuaded to vote for a tax cut in the range of 14 trillion , a level that mr bush signaled today that he could accept with the senate divided 5050 , those democrats have proved to hold the balance of power on budget issues , especially since two republicans , james m jeffords of vermont and lincoln d chafee of rhode island , have said they will not support a tax cut bigger than 12 trillion so far , though , the seven moderate democrats most widely seen as the swing votes have held firm against increasing the tax cut above 12 trillion , frustrating mr bush on the centerpiece of his agenda mr bush invited a number of the democrats , including senators max baucus of montana , ben nelson of nebraska , robert g torricelli of new jersey and max cleland of georgia , to the white house this morning to discuss the situation mr bush also had dinner on tuesday night with senator john b breaux , democrat of louisiana afterward , mr bush said he recognized that there would have to be a compromise between 12 trillion and 16 trillion the way i like to describe it is , we 've come from the ideological to the practical and i'm a practical man , mr bush said in an interview with the associated press i want to get it done the politics of tax cutting this year are particularly complex there is broad support in both parties for pushing through a quick and substantial tax cut for this year to give a boost to the faltering economy there is also bipartisan backing for many specific types of tax cuts just today , the house ways and means committee approved an expansion of the 401 \( k \) and individual retirement account programs separately , republicans in the house fell short in their effort to push through a measure that would require a twothirds vote in each chamber to raise taxes , rather than a simple majority the real debate has been over how big a tax cut is affordable and politically viable , and which components should be included the prevailing view around the capitol today was that no deal would be struck on the size of the tax cut or spending levels until next week at the earliest mr chafee said the leaders should be careful about increasing the tax cut above the 12 trillion over 10 years that the senate approved three weeks ago if we start edging our way up , he said , we 're going to start to lose senators there was no indication that mr bush had changed the minds of any of the democratic senators , but several said they had been impressed by his apparent flexibility he s looking for partnership that s not partisanship , mr nelson said earlier this month when the budget plan was before the senate , mr nelson said , the strategy of the white house seemed to be to pick off one or two of us that was not his sense at the white house today , mr nelson said i felt more comfortable coming out that we would have an opportunity for a solution the senators said the president implied that he was looking for a compromise tax cut in the range of 14 trillion but none of the senators agreed to accept such a compromise , and aides to several of them said later there was a consensus in the group to stand by their support for nothing bigger than 12 trillion photo senator pete v domenici , right , chairman of the senate budget committee , and his house counterpart , jim nussle of iowa , second from right , presided yesterday over the first session of the conference committee that is to reconcile differences between the chambers on the budget \( paul hosefros the new york times \)

kraft foods priced its initial public offering above the high end of its preliminary price range last night , indicating that underwriters led by salomon smith barney and credit suisse first boston had persuaded investors to ignore a highly unusual criticism of the offering by an analyst from goldman , sachs the shares were priced at 31 apiece for a total value of 868 billion for the 16 percent of the company being sold , making kraft the secondlargest public offering ever behind the 106 billion debut of the att wireless group last year kraft previously gave a range of 27 to 30 as the offering was priced , goldman said it had halted distribution of its analyst s report , which had concluded that the fair value of kraft stock was 25 a share goldman officials said they were not concerned about the quality of the report , and were not yielding to pressure from other firms that had been upset by it instead , they said , there were potential legal issues it s not a question about research independence , said robert steel , the head of global equities for goldman we are trying to walk the fine and somewhat murky line on issues of securities laws in addition , because of concerns about the position goldman might be in as a result of issuing the report , it has decided not to trade kraft stock for its own account , goldman officials said it will , however , execute orders on an agency basis for customers it is highly unusual for a major wall street firm to issue research on an initial public offering being brought by another underwriter some say the last such case was in 1987 , when conrail went public and painewebber issued a report and that added to the attention given the report written by romitha mally , the goldman analyst underwriters of new issues do not issue research reports until a quiet period has elapsed after the offering is sold goldman said that ms mally had been instructed not to talk to the public about her report , and not to take questions on it from reporters but the firm said she would continue to answer questions from goldman customers kraft will remain a subsidiary of philip morris , the tobacco and beer company , which will continue to own roughly 84 percent of the company philip morris will retain more than 97 percent of the company s voting power , because it is holding onto all of kraft s class b shares , which carry 10 votes each , while the shares being sold to the public carry just one vote each with household names like oreo and maxwell house in its portfolio , kraft is the nation s largest food maker at 31 a share , the company s total value becomes more than 54 billion , more than three times the size of its largest competitor , sara lee but while kraft s size and long track record are contributing to a mounting demand for the company s shares by investors , some industry watchers have criticized the price as being too high ms mally s report , issued in april after kraft s preliminary prospectus was released , concluded kraft was worth about 25 a share , in part because of what she called the tobacco taint stemming from the company s association with philip morris other analysts have also questioned whether kraft has enough sales momentum to justify its offering price at the current offering price , kraft is priced at more than 10 times its estimated earnings before interest , taxes , depreciation and amortization , while the rest of the field averages a little over nine times that s a huge disparity , said leonard teitelbaum , a merrill lynch analyst who said he had not yet published a report on the stock , but may in the coming days but the pricing of the stock indicated that enough investors were persuaded that kraft s dominant position in the market would allow it to grow faster than its competitors , and thus deserved a higher valuation a goldman lawyer explained that the firm would have to send a prospectus to any of its customers who bought the stock in the first 25 days of trading , and that if it was publishing research it would have to send that research with it it was conceivable , he said , that a suit contending the prospectus was misleading could name goldman as a defendant , even though the firm had not participated in the due diligence done by the underwriters our decision not to distribute the research was based on our interpretation of our obligations under the securities law and our desire to continue to play a role on behalf of our clients after the stock begins trading , he said some securities lawyers reached last night expressed surprise at the goldman decision , but none would comment on it for the record it appears that goldman issued the research report without its lawyers having decided that there was a risk to doing so , but that now it would be unlikely to issue any report on a new offering , even if it was not in the underwriting syndicate that interpretation of the law , if widely followed on wall street , would keep any wall street firm from commenting on new issues , whether or not it was an underwriter
one widely praised development since the sept 11 terrorist attacks is an upsurge in formal discussions between people of different faiths , with muslims very much involved among these events , one of the most interesting took place on monday at the cathedral church of st john the divine in new york , where the islamic representative was none other than the president of iran , mohammad khatami mr khatami , known as a reformer in iran s islamic republic , was elected in a landslide vote in 1997 the event at the cathedral , titled the role of religion in the dialogue among civilizations , came while he was in new york to attend a special session of the united nations general assembly mr khatami s extensive background in philosophy western as well as islamic was evident in his speech , in which he commented on ideas of kant , hegel , nietzche , freud and marx , among others several local religious figures also spoke at the event , including his host , bishop mark sisk of new york , whose jurisdiction includes the episcopal cathedral , and william f vendley , general secretary of the world conference on religion and peace , the organization that convened the event in an interview , bishop sisk said he was especially pleased at how strongly mr khatami struck two points a respect for pluralism and a condemnation of terrorism clearly , his intention is to share with the west a vision of islam that embraces a pluralistic society , the bishop said this was not a superficial , 'oh , you know , we 've all got to be good folks and get along , ' the bishop said this is someone who has thought very deeply about matters of faith and meaning and how people understand themselves in reference to terrorism , according to a transcript , mr khatami lamented the development of active nihilism as a social and political force now so dangerous , he said , that it threatens human existence this new form of active nihilism assumes various names , he said , and it is so tragic and unfortunate that some of those names bear a semblance of religiosity and some proclaim spirituality vicious terrorists who concoct weapons out of religion are superficial literalists clinging to simplistic ideas the iranian president also said that in chaotic times , people ought to turn to god with a view also to reaching out to one another let us all call unto god and ask him to bestow on us a language to be understood and a capacity to listen and understand , he said dr vendley said mr khatami was proposing an alliance of thoughtful , religiously rooted moderates , from across faith lines , who could offer a vision for society that used neither materialistic secularism nor religious fundamentalism as its starting point he said the conference would post mr khatami s speech on its web site , www religionsforpeace org , by early next week first , but also one of many the nation s roman catholic bishops made history on tuesday when they elected as their president bishop wilton d gregory of belleville , ill , who became the first africanamerican prelate to head the united states conference of catholic bishops while taking nothing away from that distinction , one might note that bishop gregory also fits a pattern among the men the bishops have elected as their presidents he is known as a consensusbuilder , as were other recent past presidents and he also serves a midwestern diocese , as did no fewer than 7 of his 11 predecessors four of those men were serving dioceses in ohio at the time of their election , while three others came from michigan , minnesota and missouri one of the ohio prelates was joseph bernardin , archbishop of cincinnati when he was elected in 1974 in 1982 , he was appointed chicago s archbishop , then named a cardinal the next year , after which he asked the vatican to elevate a chicago priest as auxiliary bishop that priest was wilton gregory , who went on to serve with the cardinal for a decade , until the pope dispatched him to head the belleville diocese bishop gregory said he had been fortunate to have had mentors who were role models among them , in a special way , he said , was cardinal bernardin , who had the courage to ask the holy father to name a 35yearold priest to be his auxiliary thanksgiving memorials to encourage jews on thanksgiving to remember the victims of sept 11 , the american jewish committee has published a short pamphlet of prayers and rituals for the holiday meal titled , america s table a thanksgiving haggadah , it says the holiday will be different this year , because there are more than 5 , 000 empty places at america s table the text calls for lighting a memorial candle , vividly recalls what happened on sept 11 and closes with prayers and expressions of thanks for civil freedoms it also includes quotations from the bible , two rabbis , albert einstein and mayor rudolph w giuliani , who praised new york in his speech to the united nations as having its greatest strength in its ethnic diversity a committee spokeswoman said the pamphlet had been posted on its internet site , www ajc org
washington township this is not the kind of school auditorium your parents had assemblies in the washington township center for the performing arts is unlike any high school auditorium most people have ever seen , even though on any given school day it can be the setting for an allclass lecture or a school play but on some nights , the 7 million auditorium is the place to be in southern new jersey for top quality professional musical or theatrical entertainment country and rock stars , like trisha yearwood , dwight yoakam , natalie merchant , barry manilow and the moody blues , have performed here the 2 , 500seat auditorium , which is proudly labeled on the front of the building as washington township high school , was opened in 1998 and was used to connect two existing high schools , creating a complex to accommodate the district s 2 , 700 students the size of the school population necessitated the replacement of the old auditorium , which seated only 600 , and the relative wealth of the suburban residents east of camden allowed the district to aim for the stars after voters approved a referendum as the stateoftheart theater , with excellent acoustics and sight lines , was being built for the students' use , it dawned on school officials that the building was perfectly suited for professional performances and , if that were true , officials thought they could make some money on the deal a few people in town might have been skeptical at first , said alice coghill , spokeswoman for the district , but that did n't last long trisha yearwood recently returned for the second successive year , commenting during the show in late june that she came back because the theater was so nice if it had been built for a professional theater in the first place , rather than for the students , there might have been some things we would have done differently , like changing the entrance way , ms coghill said entering the building is like returning to classes and the restrooms look like those in any relatively new high school the refreshment stands , run by an outside company that operates the school cafeteria , are card tables set up in the hallways the profits from food sales go to the school district as does the rental of the hall right now the professional acts pay the utilities for the year , said thomas j flemming , superintendent we hope some day to make a profit once inside the theater , all resemblance to a high school ends the stage is larger than in most professional theaters of comparable seating capacity the theater fills a niche in an area where it can draw audiences from philadelphia and atlantic city , both short drives away , as well as from the vast areas of suburbia that surround the school compared with theaters in philadelphia of similar size , most of which are old and have little or no convenient parking , the washington township center for the performing arts , with its comfortable seating and large free parking lot , is incredible , said jesse lundy , publicist for new park entertainment , a professional booking company in philadelphia that handles acts for the center some other new schools have auditoriums that are used for regional forprofit entertainment , but none book the national star power that appears in washington township , said rebecca keith , general manager for the center ms keith is an employee of the school district who acts as a liaison between the performers and the school the students get first chance using the theater and are guaranteed 100 days use of the auditorium a year for all the usual things that go on in a school auditorium but the professional quality of the setting and the presence of star performers give the students extra opportunities to study all aspects of theater , including working with some of the acts , mr flemming said the school is adding new programs to meet the core curriculum standards in arts and the theater imposed by the state , he said we were voted one of the top 100 schools for music education in the nation , partially because of what the theater allows us to offer the students photos trisha yearwood , inset , performing recently at the performing arts center at washington township high school in sewell thomas j flemming , school district superintendent , in front of center \( photographs by tim shaffer for the new york times \)
nana nantwi loves children , which is why he is not entirely happy as the educational director at the labor bathgate community child care center in the bronx although a playground sits next to the center , the children do not use it , and instead must cross busy anthony avenue to use claremont park if they want to play on the grass anyone can go to that park , and anything can happen to these kids , mr nantwi said once , he recalled , the children pushed a man lying on the ground in claremont park to wake him up , but the man had been shot in the forehead , and was dead they are forced to use the park because the playground next door to the center , once equipped with slides , a grill and a performance stage , is now covered by kneehigh weeds , broken beer bottles and food wrappers money to maintain the playground , and 10 like it , disappeared four years ago a lapse that was discovered only recently , and that city officials are suggesting was an error the playground was built more than a decade ago on one of 12 reclaimed junkyards owned by the city under the lots for tots program the sites were chosen because they were next to day care centers under contract to the city in poorer neighborhoods the day care centers had keys to the fenced playgrounds and hired workers to maintain them by many accounts , these playgrounds became neighborhood oases but in 1997 , after the administration for children s services took over control of the lots from the human resources administration , the line 'lots for tots' just disappeared from our annual budget , mr nantwi said at five other locations , the playgrounds have similarly succumbed to elements both human \( graffiti \) and natural \( rats \) of the original 12 , 6 are still operating , though none are open to children on weekends jack deacy , a spokesman for the administration for children s services , could not explain why financing for all but one of the 12 playgrounds 2 , 500 for each playground a year was canceled we are trying to determine why that line in the budget disappeared , he said this may be a bureaucratic oversight the oversight has taken more than four years to be discovered by the administration for children s services the office of c virginia fields , the manhattan borough president , first stumbled across the problem , her spokeswoman said when she was a member of the city council in 1996 , ms fields allocated 61 , 000 from her budget to repair one of the program s playgrounds in harlem next to harbor morningside children s center the money , which has stayed with the administration for children s services , rolled over from year to year without ever being touched recently , ms fields earmarked more money more than 40 , 000 for repairing the same playground but , fearing continuing inertia from the administration for children s services , said her spokeswoman , lisa daglian , her office called new york 1 , which first reported on the issue the bestcase scenario is that the money fell through the cracks , ms daglian said the worstcase scenario was that acs was not really interested in moving these projects along it just seems the play lots were not a priority to them now , the child welfare agency has assigned workers to clear the playground adjacent to the harbor morningside children s center and promised to repair the other ones but some government officials say the day care centers should bear some responsibility , too those other centers were able to find funding to maintain their playgrounds , said gerard lordahl , a director of the council on the environment , part of the mayor s office , referring to the centers that managed to keep nearby lots open officials at those centers said they kept the playgrounds open only by borrowing money from the community centers to which they belong mr deacy said there were discretionary funds in the annual outlays the child welfare agency gives to the day care centers that could have been used to maintain the lots but rory scott , director of the harbor morningside children s center , said the budget can barely pay for the things we need now there is no extra money the fingerpointing is of no interest to tanasia wright , 5 , one of mr nantwi s students her goal is simple i want to play there , in the playground , she said because it has a little bit of stuff , like slides photo this bronx playground adjoins a child care center , but funds for its upkeep vanished from the budget \( g paul burnett the new york times \)
mordecai richler , the cranky and combative canadian novelist and critic whose sometimes ribald writing exposed the heart of old world montreal while skewering bourgeois ambition , the roots of jewish identity and the quebec separatist movement , died yesterday in a montreal hospital he was 70 louise dennys , his canadian editor and publisher since 1993 , said the cause was complications arising from kidney cancer mr richler , the author of the apprenticeship of duddy kravitz , barney s version and other novels , fled montreal as a young writer and spent 20 years abroad , although he never left the city and its characters out of his writing he returned in 1972 but continued to spend part of the year in england for the rest of his life he often referred to himself as a minority within a minority he used his status as an irritable , englishspeaking jew in the overwhelmingly frenchspeaking province of quebec \( itself a minority within predominately englishspeaking canada \) to highlight the hypocrisies of contemporary life in more than two dozen books of fiction and nonfiction , along with innumerable contributions to magazines , he became one of the first canadian writers to be widely recognized outside of canada in a peculiar way that reflected the ambiguous nature of his bilingual , bicultural homeland , mr richler \( pronounced richler \) was considered both an icon of canadian culture , who won all of canada s most important literary awards , and one of that culture s most withering critics over a long career , he infatuated readers on two continents and managed to offend nearly everyone in some way few outside of his immediate family were spared his mocking venom he attacked every target vigorously , and anticipated the critical backlash that followed the publication of nearly every book and article he wrote i'm criticized by the feminists , i'm criticized by the jewish establishment , i'm criticized by canadian nationalists and why not \? he once told an interviewer i 've had my pot shots at them i'm fair game he saved some of his choicest bons mots for the frenchspeaking elite in quebec during the decades that mr richler lived abroad , french quebecers wrested control of the province from englishspeaking canadians and pursued a separatist agenda many of their actions galled him , but none more so than restrictions on the use of english to ensure that the french language would be dominant in quebec in 1977 , shortly after the separatist parti qu b cois , then in office , brought in the french language charter , we were subjected to a degree of linguistic cleansing , he wrote in one of his frequent journalistic contributions to magazines the word hamburger was adjudged an impurity imposed on qu b cois pure laine by their colonial masters in the foreign capital of ottawa so it was ruled that it should be immediately replaced by hambourgeois , which was what we were supposed to ask for if we suffered a gros mac attack for years mr richler engaged in a running battle with le devoir , a frenchlanguage newspaper in montreal that supported the separatist cause he accused the newspaper of treason , antisemitism and more at a roast of mr richler in 1993 , beno t aubin , managing editor of le devoir , reminded the audience that french speakers considered mr richler s portrait of quebec to be fiction , not journalism , and oftentimes completely unfounded , or even libelous despite the protests of separatists , mr richler s view of quebec greatly shaped the way the englishspeaking world viewed the province s struggle for independence he was the writer magazines like the new yorker turned to for reports on secessionist fever or the fate of the united states s closest ally when the television news program 60 minutes produced a segment that poked fun at the tough new language laws in quebec , mr richler acted as guide mr richler was also criticized by jewish groups for his unflattering portrayal of montreal s jewish community he was , as always , unapologetic in mr richler s mind , his canadian identity was thoroughly entangled with his jewishness to be a jew and a canadian , he wrote , is to emerge from the ghetto twice , for selfconscious canadians , like some touchy jews , tend to contemplate the world through a wrongended telescope after a brief marriage that ended in divorce , mr richler married florence wood , a canadian model , in 1960 his wife survives him , as do their five children , daniel , noah , emma , martha and jacob mordecai richler was born jan 27 , 1931 , in the tightly packed jewish neighborhood around st urbain street in montreal his grandfather was a rabbinical scholar and his father , moses isaac richler , was a scrapyard dealer and a dreamer though raised in an orthodox family , mr richler was not especially observant by the time he was 12 he considered himself an atheist , which infuriated his family as a teenager , he joined the zionist habonim movement to spite them by the time he entered sir george williams college in montreal , he was convinced that he wanted to become a writer he majored in english , but after two years set off for europe he lived in paris for a short time before moving to london , staying there for almost 20 years
trenton a month of marathon hearings about racial profiling by the state police meandered to its close here last evening with uncertainty about everything , including whether the hearings were actually over solutions for the longrunning problem remain unclear culprits in the state police were never identified even the clearest outcome of the hearings was denied by one of the senate judiciary committee members i hope the public is not getting the idea that we are out to get peter verniero , senator raymond zane said yesterday but the committee was obviously gunning for justice verniero , the state supreme court judge whom committee members angrily accused of misleading them about racial profiling when he was attorney general under christie whitman after justice verniero gave 13 hours of often forgetful testimony two weeks ago , the committee and acting gov donald t difrancesco called for his resignation , raising the possibility of impeachment by the general assembly this week , with mr verniero s role fully aired , fewer senators came to hear testimony from victims of profiling and discrimination the senate committee chairman , william l gormley , said he intended to call yet another session but now that the senate has filled the pot with water , heated it to a rolling boil and hoisted justice verniero over it , the tension is whether the assembly will drop him in informed betting is running against it many in the assembly are said to view justice verniero as the senate s business besides , an impeachment trial by the republicancontrolled legislature of a former republican attorney general would hardly help the party during next fall s gubernatorial election new jersey republicans have turned into a dysfunctional family , but it s unlikely they 'll actually torch their own house the state has more of an investment in whether the culture of the state police actually changes a moment last week perfectly captured the stubbornness of that culture attorney general john j farmer jr told the committee that despite administrative changes , records show that racial bias continues in stops and searches on the new jersey turnpike in response , ed lennon , the head of the state troopers' union , said he knew there was no such problem because no trooper had been pulled off the road or disciplined mr lennon was not advocating disciplining anyone he was simply taking the timehonored racialprofiling stance the problem must not exist because no one is addressing it if the senate judiciary hearings exposed anything , it was the mostly white state leadership s official denial of a burning issue among minorities senator wayne r bryant , testifying yesterday as a member of the legislative black and latino caucus , reminded the allwhite committee that minority legislators requested hearings on racial profiling in 1998 and 1999 and that legislative leaders turned them down when caucus members held their own hearings in 1999 , legislative leaders denied them staff assistance caucus members personally paid for a stenographer , he said none of the 20 laws proposed by the caucus has come up for a hearing or a vote in the legislature sometimes you wonder if it was because it s africanamerican and latino legislators , said assemblyman leroy j jones , a caucus member mr gormley reminded mr jones that he , too , held a racialprofiling hearing that same year , but no one came with the political climate altered , everyone came to this year s hearings that included black state troopers who first raised the issue of racial profiling and discrimination nearly a decade ago , only , they say , to be ostracized and harassed by the department they brought along racially insulting material used as nasty pranks by fellow officers some from as recently as a few months ago they were pained at how little the culture of the department seemed to have changed one of the troopers , gregory sanders , said that without holding anyone in the department responsible for the racial profiling , you do n't send a message that what you did was wrong col carson dunbar , the state police superintendent , said the difficulty of rooting out racial profilers was in proving intent understanding what was motivating the trooper at the close of the racialprofiling hearings , with justice verniero s future uncertain and with state police still living in the past , the intent of the legislature is also an open question , yet to be proven
new delhi , feb 15 myanmar , ruled by one of the world s most repressive military governments , welcomed a highlevel indian cabinet minister this week the first to visit since the generals set aside the 1990 elections there and crushed the democracy movement india has continued diplomatic and trade relations with myanmar , formerly known as burma , during the last decade , but the last important official to venture to myanmar was rajiv gandhi , who went there in 1987 when he was prime minister the chill between the two nations turned into a warm embrace this week throughout his threeday visit , which ended today , jaswant singh , india s minister of external affairs , or foreign minister , spoke about the growing partnership between the two nations with an enthusiasm that was clearly a welcome change for a government that has often suffered international scorn india , the dominant power in south asia and the world s largest democracy , shares a border with myanmar that is more than 960 miles long mr singh today inaugurated the myanmarindia friendship center for remote sensing and data processing , which was developed with indian technical expertise that will help myanmar generate weather forecasts , as well as crop and ground water surveys on tuesday , at a ceremony to mark the opening of a 99milelong road that india built for myanmar the first such project between the two countries mr singh said it was a privilege for india to be a partner in myanmar s development speaking in more philosophical terms , mr singh said his trip to myanmar was guided by what he called the primacy of geoeconomics in the world he made no public calls during his visit for the generals to restore democracy or to release the leader of the country s democratic opposition , daw aung san suu kyi , who has been under house arrest for much of the last decade rather , mr singh told indian reporters traveling with him that he hoped india could encourage a return to democracy through its engagement with myanmar and said india had raised such questions at an appropriate time and place india s credibility towards democracy does not have to be proved , he said but the government is also wedded to national interest mr singh defined those interests as including greater trade and tourism for both india s northeastern states and myanmar , a goal that he said would be aided by the opening of the new road , built at an expense to india of more than 20 million it runs from tamu , on the indiamyanmar border , through kalewa to kalemyo in myanmar at the ceremony in the small border town of tamu , dancing schoolchildren , a gaggle of uniformed generals and thousands of flagwaving people greeted him foreign reporters are generally not allowed into myanmar and none of the indian journalists with mr singh quoted ordinary people , but the correspondent for the hindu , a daily newspaper , noted , reporters accompanying him could see small children with indian and myanmar flags making it clear that yangon was happy with the project yangon , formerly known as rangoon , is the capital of myanmar mr singh said , the significance of this road is its continuation of our great tradition of social and spiritual linkages between our two neighboring countries
new york city s vocational high schools are deeply segregated by sex , with most girls enrolled in programs leading to traditionally female careers like cosmetology and boys predominating in schools geared toward hightech , higherpaying jobs , a women s rights group has charged in a letter to schools chancellor harold o levy this week , the national women s law center in washington complained that the board of education operates virtually a dual system of vocational high schools for male and female students according to the law center , 9 of the city s 18 vocationaltechnical high schools had student bodies that were more than 70 percent male in the 19992000 school year , while 4 had student bodies that were more than 70 percent female the schools with predominantly female enrollments offer vocational programs leading to jobs like cosmetology , nursing assistance and clerical support , said marcia d greenberger , copresident of the law center in contrast , she said , the schools that enroll mostly male students offer many hightech programs that lead to highwage work , like mechanical engineering and computer repair ms greenberger said that in allowing vocational schools to remain segregated , the board of education was violating title ix of the education amendments of 1972 , which prohibits sex discrimination in programs that receive federal money karen finney , a spokeswoman for mr levy , said yesterday that the chancellor was taking the complaint seriously she said that mr levy was trying to improve the infamously confusing process of choosing a high school in new york city , and that one of the goals is for all students to have the full range of information about every option among the troubling aspects of the vocational programs with overwhelmingly female student bodies is that none provide advanced placement courses in math or science , ms greenberger said in their letter to mr levy , the law center leaders also charged that many vocational schools send signals that they want only male students for example , they wrote , at a high school fair last fall , samuel gompers high school in the bronx , whose student body is 83 percent male , had a banner over its recruiting table that read , gompers builds mechanical men to stop the inequities , ms greenberger said , the board should offer not only more advanced placement courses but more courses geared toward hightech careers in the four vocational schools with predominantly female enrollments those schools are fashion industries high school in manhattan , william h maxwell high school in brooklyn , and jane addams high school and grace h dodge high school , both in the bronx she said the predominantly male schools should also work harder to recruit female students and make them feel welcome this is not the first time the board of education has been accused of allowing sex discrimination in its vocational education system in 1982 , the state education department charged that the city s vocational schools were discriminating against female students in counseling , recruiting , admissions and overall treatment the board agreed to make changes to comply with the law and for a few years , the number of female students at traditionally male vocational schools increased but of the nine vocational schools whose student bodies were more than 70 percent male in 19992000 , only one , thomas a edison high school in queens , has increased its female enrollment significantly since 1993 , ms greenberger said three of the schools samuel gompers , aviation high school in queens and transit tech high school in brooklyn actually saw a decline in female enrollment , she said the center used 19992000 enrollment figures because the board has not yet published figures from last year overall enrollment in the city s vocational high schools has dwindled , partly because of the increasing pressure to raise academic standards and prepare all students for college instead of focusing almost exclusively on preparation for specific trades , the schools must prepare students for the rigorous regents examinations that the state now requires every student to pass before high school graduation
robert sean leonard was standing on the bare stage of the neil simon theater one afternoon recently , learning the steps to shipoopi that s right , shipoopi , the silly act ii dance number in the music man , which mr leonard was about to join as musical comedy s consummate flimflam man , prof harold hill you know what s going to help \? tara young , the show s associate choreographer , said as she watched the actor go very tentatively through his paces bend your knees the 32yearold mr leonard , who in 16 years as a professional actor has performed in a musical just once and that was in a workshop looked at ms young as if she were a sherpa trying to drag him up everest i am so blinded by fear at this point that it does n't matter , he said so just what was an actor of mr leonard s dramatic gifts an accomplished interpreter of shaw and o'neill , a tony award winner last season for his work in tom stoppard s invention of love , a performer accustomed in movies to playing glib yuppies \( the last days of disco \) and tormented preppies \( dead poets society \) doing in a number like shipoopi \? filling the gap , that s what mr leonard s path to musical comedy he began performances on tuesday was a result of his rising stature in the business , his willingness to go out on a limb and the dearth of bankable male musicalcomedy stars willing to commit to broadway finding charismatic , vocally secure leading men for musicals is one of the toughest jobs in show business just ask the broadway casting directors who have to scour the earth for candidates i'm petrified about casting 'the boys from syracuse , ' jim carnahan , the casting director of the roundabout theater company , said of the forthcoming revival of the 1938 rodgers and hart musical why the worries \? the boys from syracuse is a mistakenidentity caper involving two sets of male twins in other words , four male leads the problem is that when you 're dealing with leading men in their 30 s and 40 s who are talented , they can work in television and film all the time , mr carnahan said why should they commit to a year on broadway \? in fact , some in the casting business say that wellknown actors who can sing sometimes play down or even remove their musical credits from their r sum s for fear of being typecast while other stars who might be vocally up to a plum part drop out of consideration once hollywood beckons such was the case with hugh jackman , who played curly in trevor nunn s celebrated london revival of oklahoma ! but became unavailable for the new york production this coming march after his highimpact performance in the movie version of xmen when there s someone with that much sex appeal who is suddenly catapulted into movie stardom , it becomes very difficult , said jay binder , the casting director of the music man in that show , mr leonard took over from eric mccormack , who in turn had replaced craig bierko minting broadway stars is difficult in any era , but these days , casting directors say , the ranks are particularly thin , and thinner still among men than women ask people in the industry to name actors who have become bona fide abovethetitle musical stars over the last 20 years , and only a few are mentioned frequently the list usually includes middleaged performers like nathan lane , michael crawford , mandy patinkin and james naughton , and a couple who are slightly younger , matthew broderick and brian stokes mitchell it is because there are so few actors in this category that casting directors and producers have to become resourceful in finding male leads , to the point of poring over their lists of dramatic actors , looking for those who can carry a tune mr carnahan said that in the midst of casting 1776 , he came across michael cumpsty , who had done a reading of the sound of music but was far better known for his frequent work in estimable broadway dramas like racing demon and electra he told me he did n't have any sheet music , mr carnahan recalled so i said , 'do n't panic , ' and i went out and bought sheet music and brought it to the audition after being cast in 1776 as john dickinson , mr cumpsty has continued in that musical vein , stepping up to the even more demanding role of the impresario julian marsh in the current revival of 42nd street the male star shortage also explains why many musical marquees are emblazoned with the names of actors whom audiences may not be familiar with among the current crop of younger leading men including mr bierko , douglas sills \( the scarlet pimpernel \) , patrick wilson \( the full monty \) , marc kudisch \( bells are ringing \) , adam pascal \( aida \) , brent barrett \( chicago \) and brian d'arcy james \( titanic \) none are even close to being household names mr barrett , who received plaudits for his appearance opposite reba mcentire in annie get your gun and is to open soon opposite marin mazzie in the london production of kiss me , kate , said that when a part is up for grabs , the names he hears tend to come from the same small circle into which he has gained admittance i have now landed in the leadingman category , mr barrett said , and so people start coming to you to do things

new yorkers now hold a sunnier view of their city and its future than they have held in nearly a quarter of a century , with many crediting mayor rudolph w giuliani for its improved fortunes nonetheless , most say they are not concerned about the pending change of leadership at city hall , and few are paying much attention to the contest to replace him , according to the latest new york times poll with the exception of the public school system and the cost and availability of housing , both areas of continuing worry among new yorkers , the buoyant view of the city was evident almost across the board respondents offered an upbeat view of the economy , their families' financial situations , the performance of the police department , the safety of the streets and race relations the number of new yorkers who said they or a family member had been a victim of a crime in the last year , 10 percent , was the lowest it had been since the times began asking the question in 1985 barely onethird of respondents said they would move out of new york city if they could , a drop from 60 percent 10 years ago , before mr giuliani took office although black respondents continued to hold a bleaker view of some aspects of new york than whites did , the disparity was not as great as it has been in past times polls even as voters expressed an upbeat view of the state of the city , most did not believe that the change in administration would push new york off course nearly twothirds of respondents said they believed that new york would be as good a place to live , or even better , no matter who succeeded mr giuliani black voters in particular said they thought life in new york would improve with mr giuliani s departure and while mr giuliani s approval rating has edged up above 50 percent for the first time in more than two years in this latest poll , he would apparently have a tougher time winning reelection this year , were it allowed , than he did in 1997 , when he defeated ruth w messinger by 14 percentage points in hypothetical matchups , all four of the major democrats would run a close race with mr giuliani , the poll found given the overall sense of satisfaction among many new yorkers , the competitive democratic primary to succeed mr giuliani has not drawn much attention and remains muddled with a month to go until the sept 11 primary one in five respondents say they have not decided whom to support among enrolled democrats , mark green , the public advocate , is ahead with 29 percent fernando ferrer , the bronx borough president , followed him with 19 percent the city comptroller , alan g hevesi , had 14 percent , while the the city council speaker , peter f vallone , drew 12 percent if no candidate gets above 40 percent in the primary , there will be a runoff between the two highestscoring candidates on sept 25 but among democrats who said they definitely intended to vote in the primary , the race looks closer mr green leads with 30 percent to mr ferrer s 23 percent , a statistically insignificant difference mr vallone has 14 percent , and mr hevesi essentially ties him with 13 percent the difference between mr hevesi and mr vallone was not statistically significant in either group nonetheless , mr hevesi s weak showing , particularly after he took the unusual step earlier this year of spending more than 1 million on an early round of television advertisements , could undercut his continuing effort to present himself as the sleeper candidate in the race as he seeks to win the support of elected democratic leaders and union heads a quinnipiac university poll released yesterday showed a slightly different lineup among democrats at this stage of the campaign among likely voters , mr green was in the lead with 32 percent , mr hevesi followed at 18 percent , and mr vallone and mr ferrer were at 15 and 14 , respectively the margin of sampling error among likely voters was plus or minus five percentage points the number of republicans questioned in the times poll was too small to present more than a rough indication of how that contest is shaping up that said , it does appear that michael r bloomberg , the billionaire communications executive , is comfortably ahead he is leading his opponent , herman badillo , by nearly six to one among registered republican voters the times poll was conducted aug 5 to 12 with 1 , 353 new yorkers , of whom 924 said they were registered to vote of those voters , 548 said they were enrolled as democrats the margin of sampling error is plus or minus four points for democratic voters , and plus or minus three points for all registered voters among those democrats who said they intend to vote , the margin of error is plus or minus five points if history is any guide , the amount of attention voters are paying to the primaries should jump up in the days ahead , as all the candidates go on the air with commercials mr green released his first advertisement yesterday , thus becoming the fourth democrat to go on the air

atlanta jamie kellner sat back and gazed out the window as the gulfstream v corporate jet began its gentle glide into this city , his new home down below , a billowy carpet of green trees and brush was broken up by a glassy lake i did n't know there was water there , he said mr kellner , who was looking for a place to live , paused , then added , i wonder how i get a piece of that mr kellner , who at 54 is squarejawed and street tough even though he now lives luxuriously , was talking real estate but he might as well have been referring to the primetime , network television audience that is what he thinks about most of the time , and this day in early june was no exception mr kellner is one of the great poachers in the television industry , a man who has made his career first at the fledgling fox , then at the upstart wb stealing large chunks of audience from the three dominant broadcast networks now he is at it again , chosen by aol time warner to take the old ted turner empire of cnn , tbs and tnt , combine it with wb , use aol s breadth and power and head them all into the territory of networksize ratings , not the tiny niches occupied by all basic cable networks in a sense , mr kellner , as chief executive of the turner broadcasting system , embodies aol s strategy to make sure that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts his mission is to promote synergy within his empire , to orchestrate crosspromotion and to help the parent company sell advertising packages that span all of its outlets there are skeptics synergy is a buzzword , but often requires convincing and even coercing people who are accustomed to working at crosspurposes to work together and basic cable networks have yet to regularly draw audiences anywhere near the size of those of the broadcast networks i think that s a perfectly good ambition , said stephen chao , who , as president of usa cable , the cable division of usa networks , is mr kellner s chief cable competitor how you get there is the question the turner networks like all established cable networks are struggling just to maintain their market share in the face of newer , narrowly focused rivals like home garden , the travel channel , animal planet and the promise of even more considering that the turner cable networks generate an estimated 10 percent of aol time warner s revenue and cash flow , mr kellner faces huge pressure just to keep them at current levels , especially in a soft advertising market that is why mr kellner , a gravelly voiced new york native , has worked fast since taking the job in march at cnn , he rehired the popular financial news anchor , lou dobbs , and talked with cbs about a possible news alliance in his most controversial move , he approved the hiring of andrea thompson , an actress on abc s nypd blue , as a headline news anchor her hiring added to the nervousness at cnn , recently shaken by the layoff of 400 workers it came soon after mr kellner , the hollywood insider who helped bring to television the simpsons and married with children , had declared that the news network needed more showmanship mr kellner assuaged some of their fears , however , on monday , when he announced that he had chosen walter isaacson , the time inc editorial director and former managing editor of time magazine , as cnn s new chairman and chief executive , succeeding tom johnson at tbs and tnt , mr kellner has increased promotion of shows and pulled wrestling off the schedules ultimately , mr kellner said , he wants to find programming for the turner entertainment networks that will attract the sort of audience drawn by the sopranos or sex and the city on hbo eventually , he said , he would like to start new cable networks , like a music channel to compete with viacom s mtv he has his team brainstorming other ideas for channels but before he can get to that , he said , we 've got to get our decks cleared at the top of his list is fixing cnn , preferably before it becomes an identifiable drag on aol time warner s share price the shares , which now trade at 4981 , are up 43 percent this year , but off 12 percent from their 2001 high on may 21 the problems at cnn , which brings in more than 1 billion a year , have been well publicized with increased competition from msnbc , cnbc and the fox news channel , cnn s share of the cable news audience has dropped to 24 percent this year from nearly 39 percent four years ago , nielsen media research data shows during that time , fox news channel s share has grown to 22 percent from 6 percent \( in those years , the cable news audience has generally fluctuated between 1 million and 14 million people \) aol time warner considers cnn a crucial asset in its aol anywhere strategy the company hopes that cnn s news reports and accompanying advertising will be viewed online around the world , on wireless devices and on television many in the television industry regard cnn as boring , unfocused and outmoded , right down to james earl jones s oftrepeated , earnest , promotional voiceover , this is cnn \( you probably wo n't hear it quite as much anymore at a recent promotional meeting , executives expressed an appetite for something new , raised the idea of getting rid of it , but quicky concluded that maybe it should at least run less often , or that mr jones should rerecord it \)
the teenage batboys cleaning the yankees' clubhouse last saturday evening worked unencumbered , gathering laundry and straightening chairs without having to maneuver around players after the mets won in extra innings it was the yankees' only loss this month and most of them dressed and departed quickly , rushing from yankee stadium as if it were newly condemned scott brosius noticed an edge to his teammates that had not always been present during the regular seasons of these championship years they have taken recent defeats hard , brosius thinks they 're perturbed i think we 're taking it personally when we lose , he said the yankees have seemed less invested at other points in this season , but they appear to be gathering momentum for a downhill ride that leads to the playoffs the yankees have 76 games remaining in the regular season , and only 13 of those are scheduled against teams with a winning record the yankees won 10 of 11 games before the allstar game break and moved into first place in the american league east , and today , they start an eightday , ninegame road trip , against the florida marlins the yankees' principal owner , george steinbrenner , who criticized players by name last month , is pleased with the way the team has played lately you 're never looking good until the finish and there are some great teams out there , but it s good that the kids came back and got back into first place , steinbrenner said yesterday , in a telephone interview i think we 've made some good moves to shore up the bullpen , and joe manager joe torre has done a good job of bringing them back they 've played well they 've played hard we 've still got some work to do the offense has got to keep going the way it has tino martinez has got to keep producing derek jeter has got to pick it up winning four championships in a row , that s so difficult people talk about the lakers being great , and they 've only won two this year , above all , is going to require focus on my part and their part since they won 125 games in 1998 , including the postseason , yankees players have acknowledged that they have had some trouble maintaining their focus during the full course of the 162game regular seasons with the american league east all but clinched at the end of the 2000 season , the yankees lost 15 of 18 games , nearly collapsing , and on the eve of this season , martinez and paul o'neill suggested that the yankees needed to play with intensity from the start , to avoid a similar pitfall mostly , they 've maintained their focus sometimes they have n't , like in a 52 loss in detroit on june 20 it is difficult your offseason feels really short , said brosius , noting that yankees who have been on the team for all the titles have , in effect , played six more months of baseball than players with other teams but joe does a great job in spring training of giving us breathers and making spring training seem like as little of a grind as possible today s game is the most important game we have , because it s today , but i think there s a sense of the big picture here general manager brian cashman has reacted urgently to plug holes in the roster , adding relievers jay witasick and mark wohlers in june rather than waiting for other pitchers to become available before the july 31 trade deadline but in some situations even the front office emphasizes october ahead of may when a yankees player has a debilitating injury , his rehabilitation schedule is arranged to ensure that he will be fully healthy for september and october , rather than to rush him back to play at 90 percent in august orlando hern ndez is coming back from toe surgery and he could conceivably rejoin the yankees by the end of the month , but club officials want el duque to take all the time necessary for him to be at 100 percent capability by the end of the regular season brosius said none of that is done to the detriment of the player it s done with our ultimate goal in mind , of playing beyond september mike mussina played his first 10 years in the majors with the baltimore orioles , and he feels a difference in the inseason demeanor of his new teammates i think there s a fine line between expecting to be in the postseason and being overconfident about it , he said i do n't sense , individually , that anyone in here is overconfident when you look around , player for player , and we feel that when we play the game right and hard and stay healthy , when it s all said and done , we 're going to win a lot more games than we lose players offer different theories why the yankees began playing better the hitters have had better atbats , some say , noting the resurgence of martinez and the consistent production of bernie williams the starting pitchers are throwing well , others say , mentioning the respectable performances of the rookies ted lilly and randy keisler the bullpen , once unsteady , has been helped by the additions of witasick and wohlers , who are easing the lateinning burden that threatened to overwhelm setup man mike stanton and closer mariano rivera but it might be that the yankees are beginning to sense and focus on the distant finish line in the regularseason marathon , as they did at almost the same time last year inside pitch george steinbrenner is tending to negotiations for a new stadium and the yankees' future television deal he has not yet addressed the contracts of general manager brian cashman and manager joe torre , which are both set to expire after this season steinbrenner said yesterday that after he had completed his other work , let me take a breather , and i 'll turn to that and we 'll deal with that those guys understand photo jorge posada \( associated press \) \( pg d3 \)
the ice child by elizabeth mcgregor dutton , 2495 plot lines and histrionic relationships multiply in elizabeth mcgregor s ambitious but contrived new novel it centers around three journeys that of the doomed 1845 arctic expedition headed by sir john franklin a presentday trek undertaken by a polar bear and her dying cub and the search , by a journalist named jo harper whose fianc , a franklin devotee named doug marshall , dies when he is hit by a car for bone marrow that will save their dying 2yearold son , sam jo s best bet \? none other than doug s estranged , jealous son , john , who , hoping to oneup his departed dad , has disappeared into the arctic to hunt for franklin artifacts the book is strongest in its fictionalized account of the reallife franklin expedition , which set out to find the northwest passage although little is known about their tragic end , it is assumed that franklin and his crew starved in the arctic after their ships sank mcgregor falters , however , with the contemporary characters , which are twodimensional the search for the bone marrow donor , which takes up the book s second half , forces together the separate plot lines in unpersuasive ways mcgregor also imposes a clumsy connection between jo and the polar bear , mighty mothers both roberta bernstein
dinosaurs were unlucky 65 million years ago when a meteor struck off the yucatan peninsula of mexico they died out in the environmental cataclysm that followed but dinosaurs were beneficiaries of an earlier mass extinction 200 million years ago that killed off a competing group of animals and enabled dinosaurs to flourish for the next 135 million years new evidence from rocks in british columbia indicates that the earlier extinction , which wiped out 80 percent of all species at the end of the triassic geological period and the beginning of the jurassic , happened in a geologic instant , in 50 , 000 years or perhaps as few as 100 the findings offer a tantalizing suggestion that another cataclysmic meteor impact might be to blame during the triassic , early dinosaurs competed with a group of mammallike reptiles while many dinosaurs died off at the end of the triassic , none of the mammallike reptiles survived for whatever reason the dinosaurs squeak through and the mammallike reptiles do n't , said dr peter d ward , a professor of earth and space sciences at the university of washington who led the research it really opens the world to the age of dinosaurs as we know it the researchers have also found soccerballshaped carbon molecules known as buckyballs in the layer of rock corresponding to the extinctions buckyballs , presumably formed in outer space and scattered over earth s surface when the meteor struck , have recently been associated with two other mass extinctions , the dinosaurkilling impact of 65 million years ago at the cretaceoustertiary boundary and the permiantriassic extinctions of 250 million years ago all three extinctions also coincided with massive volcanic eruptions , so if scientists verify the meteor impacts they would have to explain the highly unlikely coincidences large meteor impacts and massive volcanic eruptions , which spew out hundreds of thousands of cubic miles of lava over hundreds of thousands of years , are both very rare events , occurring once every tens of millions of years most geophysicists dismiss the obvious inference that meteor impacts set off eruptions because their calculations indicate the impacts could not possibly release enough energy to rupture in earth s crust thousands of miles away in the work reported in the current issue of the journal science , scientists led by dr ward examined levels of carbon in rocks from the queen charlotte islands off british columbia the rocks , once sediments of a tropical ocean , are among the few of that era that have survived largely intact and unchanged the relative abundance of various varieties or isotopes of carbon were consistent with a sudden and planetary dieoff of plants , dr ward said this is the first time that this indicator has been found the rocks also record the disappearance of many species of marine plankton at the same time as the change in carbon levels both shifts are sudden and are similar to what is seen in rocks that correspond to when the dinosaurs died out maybe it s 50 , 000 years or less , dr ward said maybe it s 100 years or less i 'd be surprised if it s more than 50 , 000 years i would n't be surprised if it were 100 years to kill so many species so quickly points to an asteroid impact or possibly a nearby supernova , the explosion of a nearby star that would have stripped away earth s protective ozone layer and exposed the surface to deadly ultraviolet radiation , dr ward said at a conference in edinburgh , scotland , next month , dr jozsef palfy , a curator of the hungarian natural history museum , will present data showing a similar swing in carbon levels in rocks from hungary dr palfy has not estimated over what period of time the swing took place most scientists regard climate changes caused by the gases from the massive volcanic eruptions as the most likely suspects for the permiantriassic and triassicjurassic extinctions the eruptions would appear unlikely to cause the quick dieoffs indicated by dr ward s data people are really scratching their heads , dr ward said before it made sense now it does n't in february , dr luann becker , a visiting professor at the university of washington , reported that she found buckyballs containing extraterrestrial gases at the permiantriassic boundary , the first direct evidence of a meteor impact coinciding with that mass extinction randall s perry , a graduate student of dr ward s working with dr becker s laboratory , found buckyballs in the british columbia rocks at the triassicjurassic boundary , but not above or below the boundary to date , however , those buckyballs have not contained any extraterrestrial gases

washington , april 2 president bush s detractors will say it is only fitting the man nominally responsible for making sure that mr bush talks well and sounds good often consumes himself with worry michael gerson , the president s chief speechwriter , tears through a dozen or more drafts of important speeches , leaving tooth marks on his pens as he fills a leaning tower of yellow legal pads with his inscrutable scratches and with doodles so baroque that the white house senior adviser , karl rove , once told him if these ever become part of the presidential records , future historians will say that some deranged person was near the president when it finally comes time for president bush to deliver the remarks , mr gerson often vanishes on the night of mr bush s address to the republican national convention last august , mr gerson was not inside the arena in philadelphia but walking the streets , trying to think of something anything else i'm not nervous for him he always does well , mr gerson was quick to explain , appraising his boss perhaps a bit more generously than others might what mr gerson is nervous for is the words , because he knows they help define a presidency he is the wordsmith behind such locutions as the soft bigotry of low expectations , the cyrano beyond the spotlight s edge mr gerson s brand of concise , rhythmic and sometimes alliterative descriptions are at the heart of mr bush s speeches , be it the inaugural address , with its musings on a slaveholding society that became a servant of freedom , or recent remarks at catholic university in those , mr gerson wrote that what the pope possessed is not the power of armies or technology or wealth it is the unexpected power of a baby in a stable , of a man on a cross , of a simple fisherman who carried a message of hope to rome more than two months into the bush administration , the oratorical definition of mr bush sought by mr gerson , in concert with others , reveals how the president both sees himself and wants to be seen the ideal is something that can be both direct and elevated at the same time , mr gerson explained over lunch recently in his basement office in the white house by the estimates of many political observers , mr gerson has been striking a pretty good balance , or at least hitting some memorable notes hendrik hertzberg , a former speechwriter for president jimmy carter who is now at the new yorker magazine , twice digressed in articles lambasting mr bush to praise mr gerson , calling the 14minute inaugural address better than all but a tiny handful of all the inaugurals of all the presidents since the republic was founded and even coining a new adjective , gersonian eli attie , who was vice president al gore s chief speechwriter during the 2000 presidential campaign , said , i do n't agree with what his speeches say , but they 're beautifully written , in a style that mr attie described as plainspoken but highminded , spare but elegant several speechwriters said mr gerson faced a tricky challenge , because mr bush had cultivated a folksy , selfeffacing image that did not leave much room for fancy oratory mr attie said that if mr bush were reading a broad , soaring , kennedyesque speech with lots of overblown rhetoric , it would look like a suit that did n't fit , because it s not the way he speaks , and people do n't believe he thinks like that mr bush may appreciate that better than anyone his requested changes in a speech often have to do with pruning flowery phrases mr gerson said he had seen the president take an assertive role in the speechwriting process that contradicted his reputation as a detached chief executive in the hours before mr bush attended the dedication of a cultural center to pope john paul ii at catholic university , the president called mr gerson at least three times to talk about the speech mr gerson said that of the many white house officials who reviewed the remarks , mr bush alone homed in on a passage that talked about the pope visiting the school in 1976 the president asked whether the pope had , in fact , been the pope then , as the passage implied the answer turned out to be no , and mr gerson tweaked the wording mr gerson has been writing for mr bush for about two years now , and the routine is well established mr bush wants the important speeches set in motion weeks or months ahead of time , mr gerson and other aides say \( he is already asking mr gerson and others to present ideas for a series of commencement addresses this spring \) he wants every speech to follow the simplest of outlines , so that each point flows with an utterly transparent logic to the next he likes words that are easy to pronounce and hear , and he likes brevity , preferring speeches that are under 15 minutes unlike former president bill clinton and mr gore , mr bush seldom writes big chunks of his speeches himself but he loves to tinker , and it is that tendency , combined with mr gerson s own obsessiveness , that produces so many versions there were at least 17 formal drafts of the convention speech and at least 18 of the address to congress many others are involved the first draft often comes from a writer who works for mr gerson , and karen p hughes , the counselor to the president , usually weighs in before mr bush does ms hughes knows mr bush s voice so well that her suggestions almost always echo his mike kind of wrote above the president on occasion , and karen kind of helped in that regard to pull it down to bushspeak , said mark mckinnon , a senior campaign adviser for the address to congress , it was mr rove and ms hughes who decided that despite the sweeping tax cut at the center of mr bush s agenda , the speech should first go through all the programs he wanted to champion that way , mr gerson acknowledged , the tax cut would seem like an affordable bonus , not a huge financial commitment dictating every other part of the budget mr gerson , 36 , has always loved words in high school in st louis , where he grew up , and later at wheaton college in illinois , where he studied theology , he wrote political articles that caught conservatives' eyes that soon led to a job with former senator daniel r coats , republican of indiana , in whose office mr gerson helped lay the groundwork for the compassionate conservatism that mr bush later espoused mr gerson is an evangelical christian , and he said religious faith coupled with the belief that conservatism should not berate people but inspire them was a big part of what bound him and mr bush in other regards , they make an odd couple it is hard to imagine a collection of poetry by t s eliot , which lies just a few feet from mr gerson s desk , on mr bush s night table but mr gerson , of course , describes their differences in a way that flatters the president , and he does it succinctly he s gregarious , likable , athletic , mr gerson said i'm none of those things

westwood my first visit to raku was , i suspect , like many an american tourist s first night in japan i was n't sure what i 'd let myself in for i was curious but wary and disoriented this was not for any lack of effort on the part of my hosts , who were as warm and attentive as any i 'd ever encountered the problem was that raku s address is misleading it may say westwood , nj , but it s really on the other side of the planet you get an inkling of this as you enter you walk down a passageway of bamboo screens into the main room , an appealingly angled space divided into spacious alcoves the lighting is muted and calm the hum of conversation is low you 're advised to bring your own wine , and on my arrival i asked a man in a kimonolike apron for advice on which of several sakes to buy at the convenience and liquor store next door without a word , he led me back down the passageway , out of the restaurant and into the liquor store he recommended a bottle i thanked him he smiled , bowed and returned to the restaurant he turned out to be the chef , keishi rikimaru the graciousness of setting and welcome did little to prepare me for the food , which struck me , on first meeting , as interesting but uneven and occasionally odd the cuisine here is kaiseki \( pronounced kysekee , with no syllable stressed \) many small courses of seasonal ingredients , arranged in a sequence to bring out the contrasts between and within individual dishes mr rikimaru and his coowner and interior designer , a filmmaker from demarest named joe shelesky , say raku is new jersey s only kaiseki restaurant this is n't surprising the menu makes few concessions to western palates the ingredients include such crowd pleasers as kelp , soymilk curd and monkfish liver kaiseki is expensive you choose 6 , 8 , or 10 courses , at 40 , 60 or 80 , and for 100 there s a special 10course dinner called omakase , with a few ingredients that push even mr rikimaru s expansive envelope all in all , a meal here is a commitment akin to a trip across the pacific but by my second day in the country of raku , i 'd become a convert part of it was getting over the jet lag of unfamiliar customs and ingredients part of it was that on my second visit i 'd invited an expert guide , hiroko shimbo , a japaneseborn cooking teacher who has just written a fine , comprehensive cookbook , the japanese kitchen \( harvard common press \) , and who patiently walked me through the ingredients and philosophy that go into each dish and part of it was the sashimi on my first visit , the pieces of raw fish were fresh and attractively laid out , and the tuna was buttery and fine , but nothing else was exceptional the second time , we went the 100 full monty , and the sashimi from tender scallops through delicate japanese snapper and amberjack through sweet , translucent rock lobster soared into the stratosphere in the orchestration of a kaiseki menu , sashimi is a middle movement at raku , it follows as many as four courses , depending on which dinner you order always , there is a fascinating opener called zensai that must be intended to give a sort of preview of the entire menu , like an exquisitely fashioned table of contents on a boatlike platter are no fewer than nine tiny items \( nine is an auspicious number , ms shimbo said \) , from marinated steamed tuna to a roll of daikon and raw salmon to a salty , shatteringly crunchy sandwich of herring roe and kelp even on the second goaround i did n't care for every item , but the whole was compelling a pageturner of a dish after the zensai came an offmenu surprise coquille stjacques , the french scallopsincream dish , served here in a scallop shell with shrimp and a touch of sake in the sauce mr rikimaru said he learned the recipe from his brother , a chef in florida who knew \?

when charles c conaway strode into troy , mich , 18 months ago to take over the sagging kmart corporation , he had big plans not only did he intend to revive kmart , the nation s no 2 discount chain , by attracting new customers with a wide array of useful , lowprice goods , but he would also do it by september 2002 much has changed since then , but not according to plan the company announced last week that halloween sales fell from those last year , a disturbing development in any retailing business kmart executives also said that the prime fourth quarter , when americans shop for the december holidays , was likely to be flat at best and on tuesday , moody s investors service said it was reviewing kmart s credit rating for possible downgrading mr conaway says he remains confident that a turnaround is on track we 're doing the right thing , he said he acknowledges that the makeover , which he calls a massive cultural as well as structural transformation , is still in progress , but says that many of the behindthescenes remedies that customers rarely see are already behind him some of the company s problems seem beyond management s control nearly a year ago , the economy started to shrivel and consumers stopped spending so lavishly the terrorist attacks nearly two months ago delivered a further economic blow but several analysts and manufacturers say that kmart still seems to lack a strong image that might draw consumers and is riven by problems years in the making for one thing , while other discount merchants have picked up newly frugal customers , kmart has been largely left in the cold analysts say that mr conaway , despite his efforts , has not found the formula he needs to distinguish kmart from its competitors moreover , in a possible indication that kmart is going out of its way to conserve cash , many manufacturers who supply products to its 2 , 100 stores complain that they are having a hard time being paid kmart was in disarray before mr conaway arrived from the drug retailer cvs , where he had been president and chief operating officer his predecessor , floyd hall , recruited five years earlier on a similar mission , developed private brands for kmart and introduced super kmart grocery stores he stepped down in part because martha stewart , whose home furnishings line is a top seller for the company , complained that he was not committed enough to her products running kmart has long been one of the toughest jobs in retailing once one of the fastestgrowing companies in the united states , it has been steadily losing ground for years to walmart , the nation s biggest retailer , while other chains , like kohl s , have picked up steam many things about kmart were broken , mr conaway said from the supply chain , which is supposed to transfer products smoothly from manufacturer to warehouse to store shelves , to the computer systems intended to track sales and inventory beyond that , kmart was suffering from an identity crisis while its name may be embedded in the nation s consciousness with its bluelight specials and its battle cry attention , kmart shoppers many shoppers have been unclear for years about just why they should go to kmart walmart became the world s biggest retailer by efficiently delivering the lowestpriced goods in town target created an image as the place for the simultaneously priceconscious and fashionable but at kmart , shoppers complained that the products they most wanted were often out of stock and prices , while low , were regularly undercut by walmart against this backdrop , mr conaway , a trim 41yearold whom some analysts make fun of for his tendency toward malapropisms \( in a conference call over the summer , he declared that kmart and martha stewart are inexplicably linked at the hip \) , sought to carve out a space for kmart earlier this year , he zeroed in on mothers , saying kmart would market itself as the retail destination that best met their families' needs brands that kmart already sold , like martha stewart and sesame street , fit in neatly mr conaway has signed additional exclusive agreements for apparel with joe boxer and disney the brand lineup , together with the convenience offered by the urban locations of many kmart stores , he told analysts on sept 10 , will provide a tremendous sweet spot for us , by being the authority for mom not everyone agrees walmart and target have already perfectly divvied up the market , said george strachan , a goldman , sachs analyst , noting that among the top three discounters , walmart captures a majority of shoppers who earn 50 , 000 a year or less , and target attracts most who earn more mr conaway quickly committed the company to lower prices , with his bluelight always program the price cutting began earlier this year with a few thousand products , and by last month it had widened to about 38 , 000 items , roughly a third of its total , the company said mr conaway has also tried to improve customer service , tying compensation for store managers to how well their stores do on service mr conaway boasted not long ago that scores for service had barreled upward from just 40 percent satisfaction a year ago to about 60 percent today he has also invested in selfservice cash registers that allow shoppers to scan their own purchases in the interest of improving their experience in the store

freestanding , eyecatching structure the words police station carved into the facade on the beaten tourist path between the south street seaport and battery park i'm hoping old slip will be a magnet , said carol safir , the unsalaried president of the museum board and larger quarters will permit the display of many more artifacts we only have the tip of the iceberg showing , mrs safir said her husband , howard safir , was responsible as police commissioner for moving an extensive historical collection from obscure quarters at the police academy , at 235 east 20th street , into a gallerylike space the new museum drew 68 , 000 visitors in 2000 , its first full year of operation , mrs safir said but the transition was not without controversy , including questions about how many police officers , if any , should work at the museum \( there were originally 22 that number has since been whittled down , and there will be none in the new building , mr ciaravino said \) though the lines often blur , the museum is not an arm of the department , but a private , nonprofit corporation it has applied for designation as the 35th member of the cultural institutions group , a consortium of museums , theaters , concert halls , gardens and zoos that receive city financing commissioner schuyler g chapin of the cultural affairs department said he favored admitting the police museum to the group after all , it s one of the major services the city provides its citizens , he said of police protection , and a lot of people know very little about the police department entering 100 old slip , visitors will find a big desk that used to be at the 46th precinct station house in the bronx \( the retailminded who want to go directly to the gift shop will find that it has a separate entrance \) the west end of the ground floor , where jail cells once were and landmarks hearings are conducted today , will become the transportation hall , with a greenandwhite 1972 plymouth fury squad car as the centerpiece weapons and notorious criminals will get their own display area on the second floor , next to a recreated jail cell at the opposite end will be a 40seat assembly area on the third floor there will be a firearmstraining simulator , a crimescene reconstruction , an exhibit on the use of dna in police work , a section showing how the police department is portrayed on television , and the hall of heroes , honoring those who have died in the line of duty the fourth floor and the attic floor will be used for offices and storage the design is by loffredo brooks architects the project is being administered by the city s economic development corporation to make way for the museum , the landmarks commission will move to the ninth floor of the municipal building sherida e paulsen , the chairwoman of the commission , sounded sporting about the whole thing it s a great idea that the police museum is going to be in a precinct house , she said and we 'll still be in a landmark but mark green , the city s public advocate , who is a candidate for mayor , said through his press secretary , stephen h sigmund , that there has to be a better way to spend four million scarce public dollars than playing musical agencies at the end of an administration and laurie beckelman , who was chairwoman when the landmarks commission took over 100 old slip eight years ago , said it was very unfortunate that the agency was going to be subsumed in a large office tower and lose its signature home how ironic , said ms beckelman , now deputy director for special projects at the solomon r guggenheim museum here s the landmarks commission being asked to leave a landmark the landmark in question was built in 1909 and designed by hunt hunt with deeply carved stonework recalling the muscular palazzi of renaissance florence it replaced an 1884 station house on the same site from which capt charles w caffrey and his officers once watched over the headquarters of 32 banks , the federal custom house , the federal subtreasury building and the new york stock exchange this is the most important police district in the world , a e costello wrote in our police protectors , an 1885 history of the force no officer of police commands men who have as many billions and vast commercial and financial interests to watch over as captain caffrey treachery on the part of one of his patrolmen for a couple of hours would enable criminals to possess themselves of booty amounting to millions by the 1970 s , it had become a mondaytofriday , 9to5 command , recalled richard j condon , the last captain at old slip , who went on to serve briefly as police commissioner in the koch administration and is now a member of the civilian complaint review board all you dealt with was security directors from banks , brokerage firms and insurance companies behind that placid front , however , a scandal was brewing in 1972 , as many officers were suspected of taking money from street peddlers and building contractors mr condon was brought in as a troubleshooter i went in there knowing everyone was under investigation , he said at the same time , chief inspector codd \( who also became a police commissioner \) was planning to close the fourth precinct , at 16 ericsson place , near canal street , and move its officers to old slip neighbors of the fourth precinct , including the growing artists' colony of soho and an older italianamerican community , objected furiously after a tumultuous meeting at police headquarters , the order came down to close old slip instead in early 1973 , 97 of the 110 officers in the first precinct were transferred as the result of the corruption allegations almost simultaneously , what remained of the first precinct was moved to ericsson place , which was then designated the first precinct though this was front page news at the time , the episode is not likely to make its way into a display at the police museum that s just one thing that happened at the first precinct , mrs safir said i 'd like to think that there were millions of successful investigations and happy endings to problems that were solved in the first precinct i'm seeing the glass as 99 percent full and i think that s how most new yorkers see the department and policemen photos the former station house on old slip in lower manhattan , which was the headquarters of the first precinct from 1909 until 1973 , will be the new home of the new york city police museum the exhibits will include old police uniforms , now on display at the museum s smaller space on lower broadway , and a squad car from the early 1970 s \( photographs by don hogan charles the new york times \)
the birds of heaven travels with cranes by peter matthiessen illustrated by robert bateman 349 pp new york north point press 2750 travel writers are typically obsessed with their journeys' wretchedness , how they were blighted by misfortune , miscalculation and human treachery this is true whether the author is by temperament gruff and dismissive \( v s naipaul , paul theroux \) or a humorist of extremity \( bill bryson , redmond o'hanlon \) misery reassures us that the writer is n't some cosseted tourist , but is going in real deep and misery makes us chortle beneath the duvet as we turn the page to discover whether our traveler has sunk , past his nostrils , into mud more than any of his contemporaries , peter matthiessen takes misery in his stride , as if disaster and hardship were merely fodder for his passion for being alive matthiessen is by nature a celebrant , even when , as in his exquisite new book , the birds of heaven , he is a celebrant in mourning his fascination with cranes and the worlds they inhabit makes him almost oblivious of discomfort of the ice that rings his trouser legs in the korean demilitarized zone of the sandstorm that whips away his tent in outer mongolia of the wet green hell of northern australia that is both his and the cranes' idea of paradise in the birds of heaven , matthiessen searches out the planet s 15 species of cranes , 11 of which are imperiled these tall , splendid birds have accrued a reputation as sacred creatures in societies as varied as japan , china , india and australia many crane species conduct elaborate courtship dances and throw back their slender necks in clangorous unison chants graceful and statuesque , these bugling dancers have inspired rich traditions of artistic reverence yet none of this has proved sufficient to protect them dependent on wetlands for breeding , cranes are unusually vulnerable to civilization s encroachments rampant drainage , hydroelectric dams , overgrazing and multiplying power lines on the birds' migration routes mean that few crane species are secure some , like the siberian crane and north america s whooping crane , teeter on the lip of the abyss matthiessen has alighted on a subject perfectly suited to his creative temperament he is a lyricist of loss , a writer brilliantly attentive to the way vanishings are braided into even the most exquisite moments of our lives he agonizes over what is passing , but does so in a manner that intensifies our appreciation of what remains in lesser hands , cranes might have inspired a book of interest to no one but twitchers , those birders who devote their efforts to lengthening their life lists and who might as well be collecting matchboxes or baseball cards but like all great writers , matthiessen succeeds by being both obsessive and expansive he converts his travels to farflung crane haunts into opportunities to embrace a host of landscapes , cultures and creatures with boundless curiosity this quality of alert openness makes him an excellent companion so , too , does the fact that he is one of the besttraveled people alive , a true cosmopolitan of wild lands who seems to have been everywhere his crane odyssey transports him and us to siberia , china , mongolia , tibet , bhutan , india , korea , japan , australia , south africa , england , sudan and tanzania the birds help matthiessen extend the reach of both his wanderings and his storytelling for cranes are true internationalists they are found on all continents except south america and antarctica most are migratory , flying from siberia to japan , mongolia to india , texas to saskatchewan so to observe and preserve them requires international cooperation some of the best writing in matthiessen s book is inspired by his travels through siberia and east asia with a mistrustful party of russians , chinese , japanese , koreans and americans one could scarcely imagine an assembly of people with more historic reasons for suspicion the travelers share no language except a passion for cranes and linnaean latin , which they blurt out at one another as a crane flies by , an american yells , grus monachus ! only for the mongolian guide to counter nyet ! anthropoides ! much of the reader s pleasure comes from matthiessen s encyclopedic asides , on everything from tibetan air burials to the difference between chinese and russian pollution to the role buddhism has played in preserving mongolian ecosystems as he journeys through south korea s battered landscape , matthiessen reflects on the irony that the politically explosive demilitarized zone has afforded the peninsula s cranes one final , undisturbed sanctuary few writers can capture a landscape s mood so economically flying over the uninhabited immensity of northern australia , matthiessen reflects how in such emptiness , the light aircraft felt inconsequential , like a blown feather in the mongolian desert at dawn , he observes a flock of cranes descending beside some wild horses he watches and waits , and this is what he sees a mile beyond , a solitary camel passes in the silver shimmer , then a lone human figure in wavering silhouette , fallen far behind in the hallucinatory light , the dark vessel on her head is an outlandish crown the two creatures in their vague relation have appeared from nowhere in the desert , rising minutely from the landscape and inching onward across the mirror of white sun and on down the line of the horizon in the mirage , they walk on water , with only light beneath them matthiessen observes the world he travels with great humanity one senses , through his reverence for the specific , a convergence between his quest for the irreplaceable , precisely weighted word and his campaign to secure biodiversity , its animating legacy of difference sameness verbal , cultural , biological sameness offends him this spirit is bodied forth by robert bateman s remarkable paintings and drawings , which accompany the text to create portraits of all 15 species of cranes , bateman traveled to the only place where they exist together , wisconsin s international crane foundation , which serves as a species bank for threatened populations there bateman painted and sketched the birds stalking , nesting , threatening , clamoring , dancing , soaring , surviving his ravishing color plates are sure to make the birds of heaven a collector s volume in the complex tones of bateman s art at once exultant and elegiac matthiessen s writing finds its perfect match the birds of heaven is a gorgeous , plangent work a cri de coeur for the cranes' protection and a testament to matthiessen s enduring high caliber as writer and world traveler after 28 books and 74 peripatetic years , matthiessen projects an undiminished passion for the specific creature , the distinctive landscape , the cultural oddity , the startling word in the birds of heaven , he conveys that feeling through a serendipitous prose as elegant as the stately birds that inspire him drawing \( tim lane \)
only one of them is an artist by profession but each of the strong , struggling women who tell their stories in urban zulu mambo commands an artist s wiles since life is n't giving them what they need , they create words and images that fill the void with style and make no mistake substance some might call the results delusional but these fantasies are too muscular , too eloquent and too alive to be thus dismissed urban zulu mambo , which opened last night as part of the signature theater s company s 10thanniversary celebration , has been written by four playwrights of distinctive voices and high aspirations kia corthron , suzanlori parks , ntozake shange and regina taylor the show , conceived by ms taylor and first performed last year at the goodman theater in chicago , is presented as a homage of sorts to adrienne kennedy , to whose works signature devoted its 19956 season like the dramatists of zulu , ms kennedy is an africanamerican woman who portrays a world in which reality is often a nightmare that can be put into order only through art it is hard to imagine that she would n't be stirred by this production , which opened last night at the peter norton space the evening is essentially a series of three monologues , all performed by the remarkable ms taylor \( who has also written the poetic anthem that connects the segments \) and directed by henry godinez this should n't mislead you into thinking that zulu is one of those spartan affairs with a single centered performer and a naked stage this is a rich fantasia of a production , rendered with lush visual images and an opulence of verbal and physical energy it never stops moving or mutating the stories unfolded here are about obsession and frustration talking to jupiter by ms parks is about the relationship of a homeless woman whose only friend is her talking dog in ms shange s liliane everytime my lil' world seems blue , i just haveta look at you and learn eyehand coordination , a conceptual artist is in thrall to a man whom she has seen only from a distance and in ms corthron s safe box , a cancercrippled young mother tries to purge her life of poisons through a ritualistic fire two of these stories are inarguably tragic yet there is a vitality in the telling in a defiant inventiveness that belongs equally to the characters and their authors that undercuts despair the show s rhythms are as much those of cloudsurfing jazz as of any woman s blues zulu , which has a running time of under 90 minutes , offers testimony to the potency and possibilities for depth of the short dramatic form it also has the notable virtues of presenting playwrights sometimes perceived as esoteric at their most spirited and accessible surprisingly , it is ms parks , the author of the america play and a writer given to cryptic cosmic metaphors , who has come up with the most straightforward of the central vignettes , the evening s first ms corthron , whose fulllength force continuum is currently at the atlantic theater company , achieves a new seamlessness and unexpected flashes of fierce humor in her harrowing piece , turning her fascination with topical statistics and case histories into something like song in it a woman named rame recites lists of facts and suppositions about the causes of cancer , looking for the lies amid the data rame has created for herself the safe box of the playlet s title such a place is only a structure of the mind of course in like manner , the dog belonging to hettie , the homeless woman in ms parks' tale , talks only to its owner and the beautiful , virile object of desire for ms shange s liliane is most alive in her faceless drawings of him each of these women is giving hopeful form to formlessness in arias of desire that bring to mind ms shange s landmark play from the mid1970 s , for colored girls who have considered suicide when the rainbow is enuf the characters all appropriately give urgent representation to their thoughts scrawling on the walls in chalk or sketching , hard and fast , in pencil on sheets of paper in a way , it seems fitting that none of these stories quite knows how to end itself satisfactorily it s the process , as actors are fond of saying , that counts ms taylor embodies the different characters with fullblooded warmth and stunning immediacy she does n't alter herself as much with different voices and postures , la lily tomlin \( though brenda rousseau s simple but inspired costumes ingeniously signal the character changes \) , as through what seem like adjustments of an emotional thermostat the defensive gruffness of hettie and her talking dog jupiter , the lavalike sensuality of liliane , the fiery beleaguered maternalism of rame ms taylor conveys all this through compelling changes in vocal and physical tempo she s a whirlwind , but her control and intelligence make watching her an invigorating instead of an exhausting experience ms taylor s performance is beautifully accented by g w mercier s starkseeming trapezoidal set , which blossoms into the extraordinary eyeteasing effects achieved by jane cox s lighting and martha swetzoff s video designs , which in turn are matched by the vigor and mystery of robert kaplowitz s sound and loren toolajian s original music the production has also generously seen fit to allow an occasional glimpse of an enchanted rousseauvian jungle onto which the rear door of the gray set fleetingly opens though the poem by ms taylor that begins the evening announces , it is after eden , it certainly looks just like some kind of eden that we see through that door in any case , each of the women portrayed here has earned her passport to paradise urban zulu mambo conceived and performed by regina taylor short works written by kia corthron , suzanlori

rome , may 8 if silvio berlusconi , the media tycoon , prevails over his opponent , former mayor francesco rutelli of rome , and becomes prime minister of italy in the election on sunday , it will be at least in part because of an uncanny skill at bringing disparate partners under one political umbrella one of those is pino rauti , a lumbering man with dark eyes who leads the neofascist fiamma tricolore , or tricolor flame , for the red , green and white of the italian flag mr rauti has played many roles in his 74 years , follower of mussolini , spoilsport of reformed neofascists and inspiration of a splinter group of fascist stalwarts but none seem to please him more than his latest role as potential catalyst of mr berlusconi s success , if mr berlusconi can maintain the slim lead that polls show him to have mr rauti s minialliance with mr berlusconi is bizarre on several grounds for one , mr berlusconi s principal ally on the right is gianfranco fini , who recognizing in the 1990 s that there was no broad following for mussoliniera nostalgia , transformed the neofascist movement into a mainstream conservative party , the national alliance when mr fini clinched the changes at a party congress in 1995 , mr rauti led a band of stalwarts into fiamma tricolore , accusing mr fini of betraying the fascist heritage more striking , perhaps , mr berlusconi s other ally to the right is umberto bossi , mercurial leader of the northern league mr bossi began his career in the 70 s pledging the breakup of the italian state anathema to mr rauti s nationalism and the independence of northern italy mr bossi refuses to sing the national anthem in public , a mortal sin for mr rauti when asked about that , mr bossi said not even the players on the national soccer team knew the words , and anyway , he sang it occasionally inwardly in fact , their uncomfortable cohabitation also means that victory , and any government that it might produce , would probably be short lived we do not expect such a government to last more than a year , said an adviser to mr rauti , luca romagnoli then the task will be to write new electoral laws and call fresh elections with such partners , it is little wonder that mr berlusconi hesitates to dispose of his considerable business assets to defuse the conflict of interest with his political role after all , italy has gone through 58 governments since world war ii mr rauti s movement has the sum total of one seat in the senate , the upper house , and none in the lower chamber of deputies mr rauti recently sealed a pact with mr berlusconi that would virtually assure fiamma tricolore that it would hold on to that seat in these elections , for both houses of parliament mr rauti , for his part , would give mr berlusconi help with six seats from sicily , where there is lingering fascist support that may heave mr berlusconi into the prime minister s chair the parliament confirms the prime minister the alliance is delicate for mr berlusconi besides the pact , he refused more talks with mr rauti , who says that would have been futile anyway mr berlusconi is a media baron turned politician and champion of free markets whose heroes are ronald reagan and margaret thatcher mr rauti , borrowing a chapter from antiglobalization manuals and melding it with fascist theory , proposes taxing italian overseas investment to force industry to invest at home , and he wants high tariffs , to keep foreign products out of italy he favors payments to families with children and curbs on immigration italy is going neither right nor left , he says , but downhill western nations , however , should invest more in the third world , he concedes mr bossi s policies may be closer to mr berlusconi s than that yet he is hardly a more comfortable ally in 1994 , mr berlusconi s first run at prime minister ended after seven months , when mr bossi pulled his support in parliament since then , mr bossi has evolved chameleonlike he no longer pushes ideas like northern independence but in the north much like mr rauti in calabria in the south he rides globalization fears he stresses the dangers of open markets and open borders that result , he suggests , only in plagues like mad cow and footandmouth disease recently , he proposed that italy build a 160mile wall along its border with slovenia to keep immigrants out in a typical populist outburst , he denounced the european union as the soviet union of the west , and prime minister giuliano amato , an architect of italy s opening to europe , as a nazi dwarf such sentiments as mr bossi s often provoke comparisons with those of austria s rightwing leader , j rg haider but renato mannheimer , a sociologist in milan who follows mr bossi , calls the comparisons a bit exaggerated mr haider s success is rooted in traditional rightwing politics , with a strong antisemitic component , mr mannheimer said mr bossi s roots are in northern italian separatism bossi is not a real racist , mr mannheimer said as for mr rauti , the pact with mr berlusconi was a very opportunistic choice , said piero ignazi , an expert on italian parties yet for mr berlusconi , it could be crucial , because it is in the south that the endgame is being played , mr ignazi said , given mr berlusconi s strength in the north to explain lingering neofascist strength in the south , mr rauti said fighting in the twilight of world war ii between followers of mussolini , including mr rauti , and the italian resistance was largely confined to the north and , hence , left the memory of fascism relatively unsullied in the south once a third way between capitalism and communism , fascism has become , with communism s fall , the sole alternative to capitalism , he argues that just a smattering of voters follow that view does not deter him mr rauti said mussolini s fascist leadership was an experience for italy asked what he had learned from it , he said , that it is not repeatable photos a leftwing poster , above , depicts umberto bossi , a leader of italy s right wing , in the middle of silvio berlusconi s head it reads , berlusconi s program conceals a surprise another rightist ally of mr berlusconi is pino rauti , left , leader of the neofascist fiamma tricolore mr berlusconi , a media tycoon , has formed an unusual alliance in his campaign for prime minister \( james hill for the new york times \)
beit umar , west bank , dec 29 hundreds of israelis and palestinians met at the barricades outside this embattled village today , but instead of bullets and stones the air was filled with hands lifting sacks of rice , bags of sugar and jugs of cooking oil in a rare gesture in this weary land , more than 250 israeli peace advocates delivered about two tons of food and clothing to 12 , 000 palestinian residents of beit umar , which has been closed by the israeli military blockade for more than a year it s a small step , but these palestinians are seeing that israelis can bring more than tanks and guns to their doorsteps , irit eshet , a documentary film researcher , said as she lifted sacks of rice from a truck and handed them to a palestinian boy the goods arrived from jerusalem , 10 miles away , in a convoy of 75 cars and two trucks organized by taayush , an umbrella group of mostly leftwing jewish and arab israelis trying to find a common ground with the palestinians and to demonstrate their opposition to israeli policies among the policies they were protesting were the internal restrictions on travel between villages and towns , enforced by the israeli army in the west bank and gaza through a network of military checkpoints , roadblocks and physical barriers the israelis say the blockades in the west bank and gaza are vital security measures necessary to reduce attacks against the military and settlers they did , however , ease the blockade around bethlehem as a seasonal gesture palestinians and some outside agencies contend that the effects of the blockades have been felt broadly across the west bank and gaza , devastating the palestinian economy a recent report by the united nations found that the restrictions cost palestinians between 24 billion and 32 billion in lost income in the first year of the uprising unemployment more than doubled , to 25 percent , and nearly half the population is living below the poverty line the impact is evident in beit umar , which has been under severe restrictions because of its location on the main road used by israeli settlers traveling between hebron and jerusalem roads and paths leading out of the village are blocked by piles of rubble and boulders , bulldozed shut by the israeli military more than a year ago farmers cannot get their plums , grapes and almonds to market , and men cannot get to their jobs crops have just stayed in the fields because we cannot get them to market , said owda al sabarna , an agricultural engineer in the village people here and without work and almost without hope the convoy provided a bit of hope , though not without its own misadventure before leaving jerusalem , organizers had warned that the israeli military was likely to stop the participants and force them to turn back at one of the five checkpoints between the city and beit umar but the difficulty turned out to be something unforeseen instead of blocking the way , the military provided an escort for the convoy s cars , which were festooned with yellow ribbons and signs calling for an end to the occupation of palestinian lands halfway to the village , however , the large truck carrying most of the food broke down two passing trucks driven by palestinians were flagged down and the drivers agreed to carry the food the rest of the way the israelis spent nearly an hour transferring the food to the new vehicles none of the vehicles could enter the town because of the blocked roads so the trucks pulled up as close as possible to the barricade and a human chain was formed to pass the sacks and bags across to waiting palestinians , who loaded them into their own trucks anwar ala hoisted a load of rice onto his narrow , 12yearold shoulders and carried it to a waiting truck he tossed it onto the stack and paused to rest before heading back for another load my father s permission to work was taken away four months ago and we have not had enough food since then , he said maybe now things will get better but few were under any illusions that today s convoy was anything more than a symbolic act many israelis oppose any assistance to the palestinians , arguing that it will only help them continue their violence and some palestinians resent such help a refugee camp down the road from beit umar turned down the offer of a similar convoy both sides are in a survival state right now , said ronni shendar , one of the convoy organizers nobody is ready to be optimistic yet indeed , while the israelis and palestinians were unloading food in beit umar , israeli soldiers were firing tear gas and warning shots at groups of palestinians and foreign demonstrators not far away , in the west bank city of ramallah
boston the denunciatory din over president clinton s lastday pardons makes it hard to form a dispassionate judgment on them but the effort must be made my conclusion is that much of the uproar lacks a sense of history and a sense of proportion but there is reason for outrage at the pardon of marc rich , the financier who for 17 years was a fugitive from american justice pardoning him was indefensible and inexplicable first , it must be understood that presidents have used their absolute pardon power in dubious cases from the beginning the notorious recent example was president george h w bush s pardon of caspar weinberger , whose trial might have shredded mr bush s implausible claim that as vice president he was out of the loop in the irancontra affair a president s use of the pardon power to protect himself is singularly reprehensible second , the charge that the rich pardon was influenced by his exwife s contributions to the democratic party and the clinton library is unlikely to be proved , even if examined by someone more serious than representative dan burton in any event , it is droll to find politicians shocked , shocked at the notion that money matters in politics third , the decisions by president clinton included some that were both honorable and courageous one that moved me was clemency for kemba smith , a young black woman who was sentenced to 24 1 2 years in prison for her lowlevel role in her boyfriend s drug ring an example of the damage done by mandatory minimum sentences an act of particular courage was the pardon of samuel loring morison , the only government official ever convicted for giving classified information to the press because he was concerned about growth of the soviet navy , he sent a satellite photograph of a new soviet ship under construction to a defense magazine it was a sickening case of prosecutorial abuse president clinton issued the pardon despite kneejerk opposition from the cia , which could n't find a real spy , aldrich ames , in its own ranks but none of those considerations can change the fact that marc rich is a scoundrel , a terrible choice for a pardon mr clinton , defending his decision , cited arguments by distinguished lawyers that the government should have moved against mr rich civilly rather than in a criminal prosecution for fraud beth nolan , mr clinton s own former white house counsel , answered this when she said that if mr rich s legal argument was so great , the place to make it was n't there in the oval office but in court , instead of fleeing another former white house counsel , jack quinn , played an ethically dubious role in the affair he was hired by mr rich for the obvious purpose of persuading president clinton to issue a pardon and he accomplished that , largely shortcutting the usual justice department channels conflictofinterest laws bar former officials of a federal agency for years from turning around and trying to persuade the agency to do something the same principle should have governed mr quinn of course bill clinton is unlikely to have needed such a warning unless he really blindsided himself by getting no facts on marc rich s dreadful record mr clinton is so smart that i think he must have known the risk he was taking that brings us to the most interesting question about the rich pardon how could a man as smart as mr clinton do it \? put everything else aside and consider only selfinterest could he not see that he was likely to come under severe criticism , putting at risk his reputation in history \? there are many theories about that , as there always are about bill clinton something in him drives him to take irrational risks the atmosphere was chaos in his last white house days , and nights without sleep intensified his tendency to indiscipline he wanted to please those seeking the pardon no doubt he persuaded himself that he was acting on the merits in terms of the national interest , the rich pardon is small beer the uproar over it obscures what should have been debate over what really matters , such as president bush s proposed tax cuts tilted to the rich no doubt , too , the uproar has been fanned by the usual anticlinton zealots but there is no escaping judgment on what the rich pardon was on its own terms indefensible and inexplicable
it was relatively late in life that charles l mee , 62 , became a playwright he had already had two careers magazine editor and historian when he began writing plays that share little with his books except a passion for politics his first play to receive a major production in new york , 13 years ago , was directed by erin b mee , his daughter , who was 24 at the time and making her directorial debut entitled the imperialists at the club cave canem , it is part of a series of mr mee s surreal , fragmented political plays that include the investigation of the murder in el salvador and take the united states to task for its foreign policy this season , mr mee is once again working with his daughter erin , who is directing first love , one of three related plays about love by mr mee that will be presented in new york before the end of the year some things have changed since their first collaboration for one , charles mee , the playwright , has become better known ten productions of his plays are being produced throughout the country this year for another , erin mee is now an established director who has worked , among other places , with the experimental mabou mines company in new york \( whose productions her father introduced her to when she was a child \) , the guthrie theater in minneapolis , and in india she also teaches theater at bard college from the beginning , mr mee s scripts have sometimes taken the form of collages he put together a combination of old and new texts for martha clarke s vienna lusthaus in 1986 , for example , and he has used excerpts in his plays from material as diverse as soap opera digest and the writings of hannah arendt in later years , he has turned to the greeks , as he describes in his 1999 memoir , a nearly normal life \( little , brown \) recently , i have come again and again to take the text of a classic greek play , smash it to ruins , and then , atop its ruined structure of plot and character , write a new play , with allnew language , characters of today speaking like people of today , set in the america of my time so that america today lies , as it were , in a bed of ancient ruins on a recent afternoon , jonathan mandell , a former theater critic , talked with charles mee and erin mee between rehearsals at new york theater workshop , where first love opens on sept 9 here are excerpts from the conversation jonathan mandell three plays with love in the title first love , true love and big love why all this love \? charles mee first love is about two people in their 70 s who fall in love for the first time in their lives and almost wreck it true love is the story of a woman who falls in love with her stepson , and as the news of that love comes out in this community of folks hanging around a gas station in utica , ny , they all start talking about their idiosyncratic , bizarre , unacceptable relationships , which turn out to be even stranger than this one and big love is about 50 brides who are pursued by 50 grooms who want to marry them nobody will save them from this forced marriage , so the brides agree among themselves to murder their husbands on their wedding night fortynine of the brides murder their husbands and one falls in love , which is pretty good odds the three plays come from my life with laurie williams , who is an actress with whom i lived for the past five years so all these thoughts , relationships and strange and beautiful and painful things are from the life we had together i think she was my first love in life , in spite of my advanced age when i fell in love with her , which was 57 she was certainly my true love it happened suddenly , in a millisecond and it ended just as suddenly about six months ago i think the plays have in them the reasons we found each other and the reasons we broke apart laurie has the lead in true love , which will be in a theater being built called the zipper , because it s a former zipper factory mandell a man could feel very uncomfortable casting his exlover in such a role charles mee i wrote it for her to act in before we broke up and it s hers it belongs to her i hope she has a wonderful time i'm not sure i'm going to be able to go i'm not sure i can bear to see it mandell some people may look at the fact that you have had three marriages and wonder how you can say that your first love occurred after those marriages charles mee people can fall in love for the first time when they 're 8 years old or when they 're 16 or 30 or 77 it s just what they were capable of at that point in their lives i'm afraid i was n't capable of it until i was 57 i do n't think my heart was open enough mandell is it a coincidence that all three plays are coming out this season in three different theaters \? charles mee no we hoped to make that happen mandell do you consider them a trilogy \? charles mee they are not a trilogy in the sense of being a continuous narrative or an evolution from one to the other but thematically they are three related pieces
david beard , a hedge fund manager , contemplated an investment in coal earlier this year , thinking that its price was about to spike before he committed money , however , mr beard wanted some research on the energy market so he called the gerson lehrman group , a small manhattan research firm that puts investors in touch with independent consultants who answer questions about an industry a service that can be hard to get from a large brokerage firm gerson is one of several boutique research firms that have tried to take advantage of some commonly perceived weaknesses in wall street research a lack of depth , a lack of objectivity and a lack of exclusivity gerson focuses on health care , information technology and energy leerink swann company , a competitor in boston , concentrates on health care another firm , off the record research in san francisco handles an eclectic array of topics from high technology to retailing recent developments in the markets and the law , as well as layoffs at some investment firms and a tougher investment climate have increased the appeal of such firms for many money managers the need for indepth research tends to be countercyclical , said sallie krawcheck , the chief executive of sanford c bernstein , perhaps the largest firm with a reputation for independent research it goes from being valuable to being really , really valuable , she said bill patzer , associate portfolio manager of the merrill lynch global value fund , says the workload at large investment firms limits the effectiveness of inhouse analysts with 12 or 15 companies they 're following , you ca n't expect them to know what s happening on such a detailed level , he said mr beard , who works at morgens , waterfall , vintiadis company in new york , says that he cannot depend on the objectivity of analysts at major investment banks i used to work on the sell side at a large brokerage firm , mr beard said i know the conflicts if you rely on wall street today to confirm what you think s going on , you 're in trouble money managers say the research firms have benefited from the yearold regulation fair disclosure , the securities and exchange commission rule meant to ensure that all investors get information from companies at the same time for big investors , ms krawcheck said , this has caused some problems if they 're not getting a wink from the company any more , she said , they have to seek an edge from other sources information obtained from consultants at a small firm like gerson is confidential and can be used as a trading advantage money managers at major wall street brokerage firms , including merrill , salomon smith barney , j p morgan and bear stearns , use the boutique firms hedge funds are also wellrepresented among clients in addition to mr beard s fund , they include kynikos associates , highline capital partners , edgewood management and blue ridge capital mr beard finds the firms' research valuable within a few hours of calling his inquiry to gerson , the firm put him on the telephone with a manager at the tennessee valley authority , a leading user of coal as a source of electricity mr beard asked about price trends \( they were going up \) , inventories \( becoming low \) and the length of coalpurchasing contracts that utilities were signing \( growing longer \) he started buying shares of arch coal and massey energy , but wanted more certainty before purchasing more seeking confirmation of the business trends that gerson s adviser found , he contacted off the record and commissioned a survey of 27 coal managers when the results substantiated mr beard s idea , he bought more shares of the companies the stocks doubled , mr beard said we made a ton of money gerson lehrman was founded as a publishing company in may 1998 by mark gerson , the chief executive , then just out of yale law school , and thomas lehrman , who had spent two years at tiger management , then a major hedge fund operation managed by julian h robertson jr mr gerson and mr lehrman raised about 1 million from friends and family , including about 330 , 000 from mr lehrman s father , lew , the former riteaid executive who was the republican nominee for governor of new york in 1982 \( thomas lehrman recently enrolled at yale law school but remains on the research firm s board \) they commissioned industry guidebooks for institutional investors but sold none fund managers were interested in talking with the authors , explaining that many of their best insights came through casual conversations , not from formal reports we thought it was kind of ridiculous that the hedge fund business got so much information by asking for favors 'could i please have 15 minutes of your time \? ' when they would certainly pay for that information , said mr gerson , 29 and the people who have it would love to talk we just thought there should be a way to get the two connected in early 1999 , gerson began offering subscriptions to its network of consultants by june of that year , the company had abandoned the publishing business
jenin , west bank , aug 14 there was brave talk on the streets here today about how the heroic resistance of armed palestinian fighters had scared off the israeli tanks no doubt about it , more than a few people said the israelis were forced to retreat a mere three hours after they had rolled overnight into jenin , the northernmost city in the west bank it was the army s deepest move into palestiniancontrolled territory since peace agreements were signed in the mid1990 s , and the message was blunt do n't make a mistake about which side in this long conflict is the military power here but that is not how some jenin residents saw it many took to the streets when the sun came up today to celebrate israel s deadofnight , inandout raid as if it were a palestinian victory their fighters' automatic rifle fire was what forced the tanks to pull back , they said lt nimar jaradad of the palestinian police force here was n't buying it he stood on a dusty field that a few hours earlier had been the parade ground of the police compound where he served with about 300 other officers behind him was a stucco pancake the flattened remains of the compound s main building , turned to rubble by israeli bulldozers there was resistance , but what can bullets do against tanks \? said lieutenant jaradad , 25 and the reality , he added , was that the police fled their station when the tanks rumbled in did he run , too \? of course , i ran , he replied i have nothing with which to oppose them we 're not afraid of them , the lieutenant said but we do n't have the means we do n't have the weapons that seemed to be the point that israel sought to drive home today by suddenly raising the stakes in the 11monthold conflict it was hardly the harshest attack that the palestinians had seen the israeli tanks moved in , and so did bulldozers they knocked down lieutenant jaradad s station and a security post a couple of miles away the israelis also took over the local governor s office for a while and that was about it in the early moments of the raid , there were some overblown reports fierce exchanges of fire had taken place , some witnesses said but the israeli army insisted that its troops did not shoot , and that might be so had lieutenant jaradad s station come under fire , it should have been pockmarked with bullet holes there were none after tanks rolled back out , tayeb abdelrahim , a senior aide to yasir arafat , the palestinian leader , said that the israelis had taken with them some 70 palestinians who had been arrested in jenin as supposed collaborators with israel that , it turned out , did not happen two or three people were reported killed in the raid that , too , did not happen no one died but even if the raid was far from devastating , it signaled a departure in how israel intends to respond to terrorist attacks , in this case a suicide bombing outside haifa on sunday that wounded 21 israelis the government of prime minister ariel sharon similarly changed the rules last friday when it sent its forces to occupy palestinian offices in and around jerusalem after another suicide bomber killed 15 people plus himself at a jerusalem pizza restaurant in both instances , mr sharon s goal seemed to be to remind mr arafat that israel was still in charge , politically and militarily but the palestinian authority s information minister , yasir abed rabbo , called the jenin attack a declaration of war , and a spokesman for mr arafat said today that the united nations security council would be asked to send an international force to the region to protect palestiniansand the united nations world food program announced it would provide 26 , 000 tons of food aid over six months to palestinians suffering the economic effects of the israeli blockade of the gaza strip and west bank the takeover of palestinian institutions in jerusalem , especially orient house , a symbol of palestinian nationalism , has drawn criticism both overseas and from some in the prime minister s own cabinet critics in the israeli press have questioned the wisdom of , in effect , rubbing the palestinians' noses in their powerlessness , making them even more resentful and perhaps guaranteeing another terrorist bombing sooner or later some also say that the israeli occupation of orient house needlessly thrust to the fore the eversensitive issue of jerusalem s ultimate fate , while strengthening mr arafat s hand in his demands for international observers to ride to the palestinian rescue but mr sharon has stuck to his guns , and he dropped hints today that a military maneuver like the one in jenin could take place in other towns under the palestinian authority s control in theory , jenin should be immune to israeli attack , as a city where the palestinian authority has full civil and military control under agreements with israel but israel justified the raid , saying that jenin had become a base for suicide bombers trained and dispatched by islamic holy war to strike at northern israeli cities it was a jenin man from that radical group , mohammed ahmoud nasr , who carried out the terrorist attack at a cafe outside haifa on sunday the israeli army perhaps added a personal fillip by knocking down the jenin police station , for the bomber had been a police officer until several months ago jenin became a city of bombers , the israeli army chief of staff , lt gen shaul mofaz , said today , adding that several radical groups are working in tandem with the palestinian authority s security services this reason led us to attack inside jenin , the general said a senior army officer said that since the start of the palestinian uprising last september , there have been 66 suicide attacks , though not all have succeeded blowing oneself up in the name of palestinian nationalism made sense to some on jenin s streets i would hate to kill myself , said burham mahamid , 27 but when i have relatives who are shot , who are killed , who are tortured , how can i bear it \? these people have good intentions , i assure you , mr mahamid said of suicide bombers our people seek peace , but the israelis do not give us the chance and for him , that means even worse times are ahead there is no future for this area , he said conflict is the title of the next period map of the west bank , israel , highlighting jenin after the israeli raid , people in jenin are sounding victorious
on sunday night , according to the white house schedule , president bush will travel to new haven for an unspecified event the next day on monday morning , yale university , the president s alma mater , will hold its 300th commencement ceremony and while neither administration will confirm anything , it is hardly a secret that mr bush will receive an honorary degree and speak to the graduating class in doing so , mr bush , who graduated from yale in 1968 , will join a long list of american presidents , including his father , who received honorary degrees from the university either before , during or after their terms in office he also becomes the latest political figure to be criticized as undeserving of the distinction three yale professors began circulating a petition yesterday objecting to the award the university has a tradition of not naming honorary degree recipients until the day of graduation while refusing to confirm the president s attendance , a yale spokeswoman , helaine s klasky , said it would not be unreasonable to expect both mr bush and some protest yale is proud of its record in educating leaders and it would be natural to recognize the election of one of our graduates to president of the united states during our tercentennial year , she said , adding the selection of a political figure often engenders debate vigorous expression of diverse viewpoints is part of the life of the university the event will mark mr bush s first visit to yale since his election as president he was invited to speak at the university s gala 300th anniversary celebration last month but did not attend and he did not visit the campus at all during the presidential campaign , or even more recently to see his daughter , barbara , who just completed her freshman year there , a reflection of his somewhat strained relations with the school over the years , mr bush has made public comments in which he expressed bitterness at the university , largely attributable to the fact that his father was not given an honorary degree until 1991 , during his third year as president , even though he had been vice president for eight years and director of the central intelligence agency the president s paternal grandfather , senator prescott bush , received an honorary degree in 1962 the bushes are to yale what the roosevelts were to harvard , or the adamses were earlier on , said gaddis smith , an emeritus professor of history and an authority on the history of yale itself it s no question it s a political dynasty the only other political dynasty that yale had was the taft dynasty , which only had one member in the white house , not that old senator bob taft did n't try for some yale professors , however , the honor is coming too soon in their petition , the professors , bruce ackerman , peter brooks and robert shulman , wrote none of his first actions as president merits such distinction not his repudiation of the kyoto accords , nor his commitment to a missile defense system , nor his advocacy of a massive tax cut largely benefiting the wealthy the three originators of the petition all hold sterling professorships , the highest honor bestowed on faculty members they vowed to skip the graduation ceremony in protest although they are known for their liberal views , the professors said their complaint was that the award was coming too early in president bush s tenure in the white house that s why the letter says we wish him well , said professor ackerman , who teaches law and political science he s the president we have and i wish him well i wish he really does deserve an honorary degree from yale in four years time but a survey of past presidents who have been similarly honored by yale suggests that the award often has been bestowed during the first year in office john f kennedy , franklin d roosevelt and theodore roosevelt were all offered honorary degrees during their first year as president , though franklin roosevelt did not accept his until a year later other presidents received honorary yale degrees at different times george washington and william howard taft , an 1878 yale graduate , got the honor before becoming president gerald ford got it after his brief term ended professor smith said that it was not uncommon for part of the yale community to object to a recipient there have been several instances in which this has led to protest of one sort or another , he said historically , more protest from the right against franklin roosevelt or john f kennedy or martin luther king
east rutherford , nj the new orleans saints flew into newark international airport on saturday night and stayed at a hotel nearby on their bus ride from the hotel to giants stadium on sunday morning , several of the players strained their necks and pressed toward the windows , hoping to gain a glimpse of manhattan and the open space where the world trade center s twin towers once stood i was trying to get a look at history , saints receiver joe horn said , even if it was bad history once inside giants stadium , once the pregame ceremonies began , the saints knew that they were about to play a game that was not a normal one for the giants or their fans since this was their first game here since the terrorist attacks , there was a lot of emotion and ceremony , saints receiver albert connell said there was a lot going on and then , after an opening 68yard saints kickoff return to the giants' 23 , the saints' pattern for the day emerged first play , a 2yard run but wait , a 15yard roughing penalty that pushed the saints back to the giants' 36 soon , the saints were punting from the giants' 41 by game s end , a 2113 giants victory , the saints had committed 14 penalties for 102 yards by game s end , rather than blame it on their rustiness , their youth , their own failures or even the light rain , too many of the saints wanted to blame it on the officials the refs took us out of the game the refs and the giants , connell said this was not a faircalled game , horn said and tailback ricky williams added i do n't know , maybe we get penalized for this , but a lot of our guys after the game are very frustrated over the calls made out there it looked kind of shaky how about that the saints could draw a penalty even after the game by any measure , the saints have some growing to do it was a scoreless game after one quarter and then the giants leapt to a 143 halftime lead the breakthrough play was ron dayne s 55yard run to the new orleans 26 by the end of the quarter , dayne had scored on a 6yard run up the middle and tiki barber on a 14yard run sprinting around right end two rushing touchdowns against a defense noted for its punch against the run that hurt the saints as much as penalties that long dayne run shifted the momentum to their side , linebacker darrin smith said they executed that play and tiki s scoring run very well the dayne touchdown , we should have and could have stopped that one because we were in position to make the tackle and did n't we need to get our flow back so the saints slipped to 11 as the game wore on , the new orleans offense calmed down and began to make plays there is no question that this team which had not played in 21 days because of the week of postponements after the terrorist attacks and a bye week was rusty saints coach jim haslett would hear none of that no , no , no , he said yeah , right that is why haslett wanted to fly his team during some of that time off to scrimmage in pittsburgh with the steelers his players vetoed that idea , saying they had no interest flying so soon after the attacks so , haslett worked them out for three weeks at home , but that is nothing like live competition of course , the saints were stale and their quarterback , aaron brooks , was hounded the giants tossed a lot at him blitzes came from a variety of angles and many times the presnap read was a complete illusion for brooks it took brooks nearly four quarters to figure out what was happening , and by the time he did , it was too late this tells you plenty about the youth , inexperience and emotional state of the saints haslett says his staff scouts the crew that will be officiating each saints game he said he told his team that this crew called it close , that it averages calling 22 penalties a game and that is just about how it turned out the giants' 11 penalties added to the new orleans miscues made it 25 penalties and the giants had only 2 fewer yards in penalties than new orleans but the saints players kept viewing the penalties and the officials' replay calls as the difference teams who are trying to be champions but who have not quite figured out how to accomplish it tend to do that young , eager and frustrated teams do that these saints won the national conference west division last season and lost in the playoffs to minnesota the giants whipped minnesota in the playoffs and now the saints return home to play minnesota we 've got to figure out a way to not only hang with the upper echelon of the nfc but to beat them , said smith , who knows a thing or two about that , having won super bowl rings in 1993 and 1995 as a dallas cowboy and having been a part of those wicked dallassan francisco rivalries sometimes the other team just executes better than you and the giants did that today that is the sound of a champion , right \? and the rest of the saints will follow suit this team has been built with a solid foundation , with a quarterback capable of great things , with so many elements in place to be a factor throughout the season now the saints can work in earnest with a schedule of 14 consecutive weekends of games this lesson could serve them well as they move forward take the game out of the officials' hands and into your own that is what championship teams do photo the giants' kenny holmes stopping the saints' ricky williams , who called the officiating kind of shaky \( barton silverman the new york times \)
while many aspects of life have fallen onto a time line on either side of sept 11 , one event decidedly grounded in the before period is the bursting of the internet bubble so a new wave of books about internet companies that have faltered faces a particularly intimidating challenge how to attract readers not only after the industry itself has faded , but also in a climate when far more sobering concerns prevail most of these internet riseandfall books are written as firstperson accounts by people who , for a while at least , sat on top of the world they include stephan paternot , a cofounder of theglobecom , who was once worth 97 million , and henry blodget , a merrill lynch securities analyst who became a celebrity cheerleader of dotcom stocks these books were in the works long before the economy took a serious turn for the worse even so , they are not so much candidates for a business school case study as narratives recounting what it was like to be part of a modernday gold rush for some authors , they also provide yet another opportunity to cash in on the dotcom boom with advances for books that chronicle the dotcom bust but these advances , which none of the authors or publishers would disclose , most likely pale in comparison with the value of oncehighflying stock options like previous waves of internet books that rippled through the publishing industry guides to getting online , trading stocks or buying a car on the web , or developing an ebusiness strategy overnight this trend may be as shortlived as the companies profiled and it could have a tough time catching on with consumers who are weary of stories about the internet but if nothing else , these accounts provide a eulogy for an era when companies became much more focused on telling and selling a story than on the mundane details of building businesses one of the first memoirs of this genre to hit bookstores was mr paternot s a very public offering a rebel s story of business excess , success and reckoning , published in july by john wiley sons in 1994 , mr paternot and todd krizelman , then students at cornell , founded theglobecom , a site that tries to bring likeminded people together the book mostly chronicles mr paternot s experience at the helm of theglobecom , which had one of the most successful initial public offerings in history , only to spiral downward shortly afterward \( in late summer , theglobecom shut down several web sites and laid off about 60 people , half of its remaining staff \) for those who want to know why things went south , a very public offering does not offer much in the way of revelations in fact , mr paternot s main observation about leading a public company is a curious lesson for budding entrepreneurs my principal experience as a businessman , he writes , was the constant sense of being on the verge of death always pushing as hard as possible and in constant denial of the inevitable mr paternot said he had tried to write an adventure story something that could inspire a 15yearold but could also be read by my grandmother the book is an autobiography , mixing details about mr paternot s childhood and his forays into new york night life with a firstperson take on the financial cycle that became almost a rite of passage for internet startups getting financing , going public , watching the stock price skyrocket , watching it drop a very public offering had been on bookstore shelves for several weeks before sept 11 , and jeanne glasser , its editor , said most of the first printing of about 20 , 000 had been sold we 'll probably order a reprint fairly soon , ms glasser said last week , but she noted that recent events had slowed many book sales , and that publishers were delaying some decisions until consumers were back in that frame of mind to entertain themselves another firstperson tale , dotbomb my days and nights at an internet goliath , may have a tougher sell than mr paternot s book , which had an earlier start written by j david kuo , a former executive at value america , the defunct retailer , the book is to be published on oct 15 by little , brown karen auerbach , a company publicist , said the publisher was sticking to that schedule everything on 'dotbomb' is going out as planned , ms auerbach said 'we 're booking him right now on all the business and financial shows mr kuo s book , however , may still be overshadowed by mr paternot s account value america did not have the same impact on the public or the media as theglobecom , which benefited from the publicity surrounding its collegeage founders and its spectacular initial public offering moreover , mr kuo joined the company after it had gone public , serving as senior vice president for communications as a result , his story lacks some of the glamour that carries a very public offering at least for those interested in reading about what it was like to be a young dotcom chief executive
the outcome of the federal government s antitrust case against microsoft will likely be several years down the road but a recent independent survey shows that many americans who are following the case have already made up their minds about what should happen to the company americans want a microsoft that is unified , innovative and no longer in court , said thomas riehle , president for public affairs at ipsosreid , a market research firm with headquarters in vancouver , british columbia the survey randomly interviewed by telephone 1 , 000 adults throughout the united states last weekend the results were released last week by a twotoone margin , americans endorsed the recent appeals court decision that overturned a lower federal court ruling that would have split microsoft into two companies fiftyeight percent called the ruling good news for consumers , and 25 percent said it was bad news sixteen percent said they did not know at the same time , 46 percent said they would like to see the government drop the case , while 18 percent said they wanted the government to try to reinstate the breakup penalty twentynine percent took the middle position that the government should continue to address the issue of microsoft s power over computer operating systems but drop efforts to break up the company , and allow it to add more features to its operating system a lot of people believe microsoft will be careful about abusing its position now and almost none believe the appeals court decision will embolden microsoft to arrogance or cockiness , mr riehle said most want the government to drop the case now vivian marino
woodbridge , nj james e mcgreevey nearly ousted gov christie whitman , a republican , four years ago , and now he is aiming to replace her successor , acting gov donald difrancesco , also a republican but at the moment , mr mcgreevey is just the democratic mayor of woodbridge and as a sign of how much that means in state politics , woodbridge is the latest , undisputed winner of new jersey s do n't dump on me sweepstakes the award is a brandspankingnew , allexpensepaid , 45 million institution to house sex offenders who are deemed too dangerous to release from prison even after they have served their prison sentences everyone here is duly honored to be deemed worthy by not one , but two governors of playing host to this group of fellow citizens less than a year after mr mcgreevey nearly beat governor whitman in 1997 , his sprawling township emerged as the leading candidate for a new institution to house 300 sexual predators call them ingrates , but woodbridge officials have been kicking and screaming for a couple of years now , in public meetings and court documents , saying they do n't want the sex offenders once mrs whitman left to join the bush administration , mr mcgreevey asked acting governor difrancesco to review the decision last week , the acting governor said there was no reason to change course mr mcgreevey , politician that he is , smells politics it s pretty obvious , he said in politics , shipping 300 sex offenders to an opponent s town is often viewed as a sign of disrespect i would expect jim mcgreevey to cry politics that s what people running for office do , said tom wilson , a spokesman for mr difrancesco , a person running for office in truth , there s some logic to selecting woodbridge there are already about 2 , 500 prisoners in town , divided between the east jersey state prison and the blandly named adult diagnostic and treatment center , a special prison for sex offenders 650 of them these prisons are next to another center of stateimposed punishment the rahway motor vehicle inspection station chris carden , a spokesman for the department of corrections , said the close proximity to the sex offenders prison will allow the new institution to use its resources and expertise as for the sex offenders , they 're already there convicts who finish their sentences but are deemed unfit for release will simply move next door to the new institution this convenience of suburban incarceration is not a winning argument in woodbridge i think it s an outrageous idea , smack in the middle of a densely populated area , said maria kocsis , who lives near the state complex mr mcgreevey claims that the selection process was rigged to settle on woodbridge , even though state officials say other places were considered mr mcgreevey , honing his populist political rhetoric , noted that none of new jersey s wealthier suburbs were considered everything which is undesirable , he said , miraculously finds its way to the middleclass neighborhoods that would mean woodbridge with nearly 100 , 000 people in central new jersey , woodbridge is the state s sixthlargest municipality aside from some pockets of big houses on wooded lots , it is made up of mainly bluecollar neighborhoods mr mcgreevey , 43 , is woodbridge s omnipresent mayor , the son of a trucking company salesman who got an ivy league education and made his way in local politics by working long hours and paying homage to party elders mr mcgreevey s offtherack style seems to be reflected in the motto carried on main street banners woodbridge works woodbridge , it seems , also adjusts main street represents the forces at work in a middleclass town polanka , a polishamerican kitchen , is a few doors from the carpet maven the building that once housed the woodbridge national bank is now auto parts of woodbridge residents are angry about the sex offender institution , but they 're confident they will adjust to that as well unless of course , mr mcgreevey is elected governor he says he would conduct a thorough review of the decision to put the institution in woodbridge it would all be based on facts , not politics and he added , it would be unlikely that woodbridge would be an appropriate selection
after being beamed up to an alien spaceship , a family pet takes off his dog suit to reveal that he is an alien creature himself what have you learned \? his leader asks the creature pauses to think , then responds whassup \? with his tongue lolling out of his mouth with this super bowl advertisement for budweiser beer and another whassup spot that pokes fun at uptight yuppies trying to adopt a cool attitude , anheuserbusch succeeded in taking advertising s hottest series of commercials into a new year that is a considerable feat in a business where , like the movie industry , sequels are rarely as entertaining and popular as the original the whassup campaign has won practically every award in advertising , including the prestigious international grand prix , and its signature catch phrase is joked about on talk shows , parodied on web sites and mimicked in other commercials and , most important to anheuserbusch , the nation s largest brewer , the campaign has helped it sell more beer , not just budweiser but its light beer , bud light the company s worldwide sales grew by 24 million barrels , to 992 million barrels last year , according to beer marketer s insights , a trade newsletter in nanuet , ny what is perhaps most unusual about the success of the whassup campaign is that it is not unusual at least not for anheuserbusch and its advertising agency , the chicago office of ddb worldwide , part of the omnicom group the team uses sophisticated research and oldfashioned legwork like checking out new art forms or going to underground film festivals to anticipate what is about to become hip to its target audience of mostly men in their 20 s and 30 s the language , styles and attitudes it finds are then packaged in ad campaigns that are broadcast so often that they become part of the public consciousness ad campaigns for bud light have also been pop culture hits , with wellknown catch phrases like i love you , man and yes , i am and the agency has already won acclaim for a new series of bud light ads that went on the air last month featuring a chubby comedian named cedric the entertainer certainly , the advertising is part of the success , said benj steinman , publisher of beer marketer s insights it s a phenomenon bob scarpelli , ddb s chief creative officer in the united states , calls it advertising with talk value another phrase for creating buzz , that allimportant intangible quality that with enough media exposure begins to seep into the culture the idea , built into the creative process , is to develop commercials that people chat about at work after a big game or use in a punch line at a party and then , with some luck , it becomes part of the vernacular , he said while ddb did not invent the idea of talk value \( though it has trademarked that phrase \) , its effort to deconstruct the phenomenon underlying it seems to be working mr scarpelli said the battle for consumers' attention required that commercials create an emotional reaction more memorable than in all the competitors , including situation comedies and the evening news the best advertising , he said , captures something so true that it ultimately becomes a shorthand for a feeling or a state of mind , like the energizer bunny for endurance or the saying , where s the beef \? for substance to achieve this status , mr scarpelli instructs ddb s writers and artists to be keen observers and judges of pop culture when creating advertising , they should consider whether it could make it onto david letterman s top 10 list or be used in a jay leno monologue , he said will it get picked up on the internet \? will disc jockeys start using the ad s catch phrases \? i call it the letterman or the leno factor , these guys are our arbiters of public taste , mr scarpelli said we try to create ideas that become part of people s consciousness so that the brand is always top of mind whassup passed that test the campaign came from a short film created by charles stone iii , 34 , a music video director called true , the film shows mr stone and his friends from the philadelphia area where he was raised , greeting one another with the slang phrase whassup always with their mouths wide open and tongues wagging they then respond , nothin' , watchin' the game while the other nods and says , true , true the video had already developed a reputation in the independent film scene when a copy made its way to vinny warren , the associate creative director on the budweiser account at ddb chicago in october 1999 ddb was trying to come up with new ideas for budweiser commercials on the super bowl , the world s advertising showcase anheuserbusch is always one of the game s biggest advertisers , and each year ddb competes vigorously with the brewer s other agencies to get the most commercials on the broadcast in addition to ddb , anheuserbusch works with 13 other agencies , though only a handful compete for super bowl commercials mr warren immediately brought true to his supervisor , don pogany , ddb chicago s group creative director

idaho falls , idaho buried in underground tanks and dumped into trenches at the idaho national engineering and environmental laboratory northwest of here is a witches' brew of deadly chemicals and radioactive waste left over from the cold war it includes enough plutonium debris from the rocky flats weapons plant in colorado to build hundreds of nuclear bombs this laboratory , more than half the size of rhode island , has built and tested civilian and military nuclear reactors for 52 years because of its residues and stored wastes , it was designated a superfund site in 1989 , and the government started trying to clean it up now two men who audited that effort say in a federal lawsuit that government contractors who were paid hundreds of millions of dollars made the contamination worse when the auditors complained , they said , they were harassed until they resigned the auditors said the contractors deliberately bypassed safety measures , turned off monitors and alarms , falsified documents , did not report spills , dumped hazardous wastes on the ground and illegally sent waste from a pit contaminated with plutonium to a public landfill those contentions shed a different light on what state and federal officials told the public about the contractors' problems at the site and in internal documents , federal officials shared some of the auditors' concerns officials at the idaho division of environmental quality announced in may 1999 that the united states energy department , as the site owner , would pay 504 , 000 in fines and costs for mishandling dangerous waste the division , and energy department officials , said at the time that the violations resulted from oversights or from problems created before the contractors took over things happen , mike gregory , the hazardous waste enforcement coordinator for the state , said in an interview someone gets lazy or they think they 're doing right but in 1998 , an internal energy department review said the contractor that oversaw the lab and ran the cleanup at that time , lockheed martin idaho technologies , had not established an underlying culture of rigor , discipline and sustaining leadership on environmental , safety and health issues that review , signed by john m wilcynski , manager of the energy department s idaho operations office , said that three major accidents , including the deaths of two workers , had occurred he recommended that the contract be put out for bid jim fetig , a spokesman for the lockheed martin corporation , based in bethesda , md , said that there might have been environmental missteps in idaho , but that none were intentional i do n't think for a second that there was an ethos of nonconcern about environmental issues , mr fetig said waste was stored improperly in some cases , he said , but it was hard to find out what old storage tanks contained they are still trying to get a handle on what s in those tanks and what to do with it , mr fetig said there was a lot of bad stuff out there and only so much money a contractor can only do what the department of energy approves lockheed martin did not seek to renew its contract in idaho , but still manages two research facilities for the energy department , the sandia national laboratories in albuquerque and the knolls atomic power laboratory in schenectady , ny besides lockheed martin , which ran the site from october 1994 through september 1999 , the lawsuit names egg idaho inc , the contractor that ran the site from 1976 to 1994 , and the westinghouse idaho nuclear company , which ran the idaho chemical processing plant from 1989 to 1994 the plant stored and reprocessed nuclear waste from reactors around the world mark j meagher , a denver lawyer representing westinghouse , said the company denied all the charges edward w pike , an idaho falls lawyer representing egg , declined to comment on the case also named is coleman research , a lockheed martin subcontractor that employed the auditors , neil mock and scott lebow william goodrich , a lawyer for coleman , said the company did not retaliate against the men for their complaints the lawsuit is being brought under a federal law that allows individuals who contend that contractors committed fraud to sue on the government s behalf and recover 25 percent to 30 percent of any judgment the suit was filed in 1996 in united states district court in pocatello , idaho , but was kept under seal until the government decided three years ago not to join it the energy department considers the idaho laboratory , now managed by bwxt idaho , a consortium led by bechtel inc , essential to the future of nuclear power , both civilian and military the laboratory has also been named to lead development of new cleanup technologies the auditors arrived at the laboratory in the early 1990 s mr lebow was a senior environmental , safety and quality regulatory compliance specialist mr mock was a senior scientist they said that they were told that employees of westinghouse and lockheed martin had turned off spill alarms on 300 , 000gallon tanks containing liquid highlevel radioactive waste , and that no one responded to two spills they saw in 1995 they said lockheed martin tried to flush out four other storage tanks egg had described as empty when the tanks were found to contain corrosives contaminated by mercury at a rate nine times the reportable level , lockheed martin continued flushing the contaminated water 24 million pounds in all into a pond for absorption into the soil and for evaporation brad bugger , a spokesman for the department of energy in idaho , said that the mercury spill was an example of bad management but that it posed no additional risk to the environment because only a couple of ounces of mercury were involved mr mock and mr lebow charge that from 1995 to 1998 lockheed martin employees occasionally disabled or disconnected the monitoring devices on smokestacks at a plant where highlevel radioactive waste was processed , to conceal excess emissions of iodine131 , a radioactive isotope that is readily absorbed by the human body they say this happened at the laboratory s nuclear technology and environmental complex , formerly known as the idaho chemical processing plant in 1995 , they said , monitors were also disabled at the laboratory s waste experimental reduction facility , which burned radioactive paper , clothing , plastic and garbage that incinerator was closed last october after citizens threatened to sue idaho officials , who denied it a hazardous waste permit when lockheed martin managers were told in writing about the disabling of the air pollution monitors , the auditors say , the company told staff members not to report these acts to the authorities lockheed martin denies this boxes of soil contaminated with hazardous waste , improperly labeled as lowlevel waste , were sent illegally to a disposal site in utah in 1996 , mr mock and mr lebow say , and a lockheed martin subcontractor , lockheed martin advanced environmental systems , illegally disposed of waste from pit 9 , which contains plutonium and other radioactive substances , in the bonneville county landfill this month , gary johnson , the assistant inspector general of the environmental protection agency , said he would look into questions about the laboratory raised by local environmental organizations concerned about airborne emissions another local organization has warned of dangers to the snake river aquifer , which is the water supply for 20 percent of idaho s population photo containers of lowlevel radioactive waste stored at the idaho national engineering and environmental laboratory ,

three days after the terrorist attack on the united states , sheik muhammad gemeaha , leader of a prominent mosque on east 96th street in manhattan , delivered a sermon in english to an interfaith audience calling for peace , healing and love among people of all religions two weeks later , he suddenly moved his family back to cairo , telling an arabiclanguage newspaper that he left because his family had been threatened at their home on the upper west side he sent a letter of resignation to the mosque his departure from the upper east side mosque , the islamic cultural center of new york city , which regularly draws 4 , 000 muslims for friday prayers , comes amid questions about an interview he reportedly gave to an arabic web site on oct 4 saying that muslims in america were being persecuted , that their children were being poisoned by jewish doctors in american hospitals , and that zionists in command of the nation s air traffic control towers aided the suicide hijackings the arabiclanguage interview first appeared on a web site , www lailatalqadr com , which normally features noncontroversial articles by and about prominent islamic teachers many are based at alazhar university in cairo , a prominent center of islamic learning whose leadership is approved by the government of egypt sheik gemeaha \( pronounced gehmayah in egypt \) served as a translator in the office of the grand imam at the university and was sent by the university to serve at the new york mosque the interview was picked up and translated by the middle east media research institute , a group based in israel and washington that monitors arabiclanguage news media the group is proisrael , but its translations of arabic news media have proved reliable the new york times asked two independent translators to check this translation , and both found it to be accurate neither the times nor the sheik s associates at the mosque in manhattan were able to reach him in cairo to ask him about the remarks attributed to him but colleagues said that if he made the comments , they would be a dramatic turnaround for a muslim leader who was a mainstay at interfaith events with new york s rabbis and ministers it does not represent at all the policy and the beliefs of the islamic cultural center , nor what imam gemeaha was teaching the islamic community during his three and a half years here , said mohammad abdullah abulhasan , kuwait s ambassador to the united nations , who heads the mosque s board it really took me by surprise to see this kuwait contributed twothirds of the 17 million to build the islamic center , completed in 1991 , and many other islamic nations raised most of the rest several board members , united nations ambassadors from predominantly muslim countries , said they were shocked at the remarks attributed to sheik gemeaha , and had also been surprised and disappointed by his sudden departure the egyptian ambassador , ahmed abul gheit , said that the sheik s family had received telephoned death threats in their apartment on riverside drive , and that it gave his children nightmares sheik gemeaha gave an interview about the threats to alsharq alawsat , an arabic newspaper in london as he left he was kind of bitter , but nothing of the sort of what i read on the web site , the egyptian ambassador said but mr abulhassan , the kuwaiti ambassador , said the imam was never seriously threatened , and did not mention it in his letter of resignation sheik gemeaha is quoted on the web site saying that a group of people attacked my home , and that he ended up conversing with them it became clear to me that they knew very well that the jews were behind these ugly acts , while we , the arabs , were innocent , he is quoted as saying although the americans suspect that the zionists are behind the act , none has the courage to talk about it in public he is quoted as saying that there is proof that jews were the terrorists because only they had the capability to neutralize the automatic pilot , command the control tower , erase the black boxes and infiltrate the white house and pentagon he hinted at these ideas before he left new york , telling newsday on sept 23 that the wrongdoers , the evildoers , might use some muslim to do this on their behalf to make hatred and enmity in the hearts of americans against arabs and muslims , but that muslims never do this yigal carmon , the israeli founder and director of the research institute , insisted that the web site interview purportedly with mr gemeaha was typical of mixed messages from muslim leaders they are saying one thing in arabic in their world , and another in english or other languages , because they live in two worlds , he said photo sunset prayer at the islamic cultural center of new york city \( justin lane for the new york times \)

an extensive federal review of autopsy data has found that the powerful painkiller oxycontin is suspected of playing a role in the overdose deaths of 282 people in the last 19 months , more than twice the number in some previous estimates the nation s top drug enforcement official recently called the new finding startling the review also found that virtually all the deaths were of people who swallowed the pill whole or crushed into powder , further suggesting that oxycontin misuse may be more difficult to curb the overdose deaths were previously believed to have been of people who injected or snorted crushed pills , which are quicker and more dangerous forms of drug delivery meanwhile , officials of purdue pharma , oxycontin s manufacturer , acknowledged in a recent interview that even after reports that oxycontin had been getting into the wrong hands , the company continued for a while this year to distribute free sevenday supplies of the drug , through doctors , to promote its use the federal study on oxycontin , by the drug enforcement administration , is the agency s first to explore links between overdose deaths and a brand name drug previous reviews had looked only at drugs' active ingredients , used by many manufacturers besides the 282 deaths , which often also involved other drugs and alcohol , federal officials said they found that 500 people had died since the start of 2000 from overdoses involving oxycodone , the active narcotic in oxycontin and other popular painkillers but federal officials could not say whether the oxycodone linked to those deaths was from oxycontin , a drug for the treatment of severe and chronic pain asa hutchinson , the administrator of the drug enforcement administration , called the study s results startling and said , this verifies the fear and concern that we have had about this drug dr paul goldenheim , the vice president for research and development at purdue pharma , said that the drug enforcement agency s data was consistent with the company s own findings but he emphasized that none of the information implicated oxycontin in any of the reported deaths there is no suggestion that the 200 subjects died from oxycodone , dr goldenheim said the study did not try to determine whether oxycontin alone was responsible for the deaths because the overdose deaths typically involved multiple drugs federal officials have said that abuse of oxycontin has grown faster than abuse of any other prescription drug in decades purdue pharma heavily promoted the drug as safer than other narcotics because its active ingredient was in a timerelease mechanism but abusers quickly learned that crushing the pill disarmed that feature fewer than 10 of the 282 people whose deaths were associated with oxycontin were intravenous drug abusers , and only one showed signs of having snorted the drug that finding , federal officials said , suggests that a recent decision by purdue pharma to reformulate the timereleased painkiller to reduce its abuse by injection or snorting may have limited benefits dr goldenheim , the company executive , said that he also believed that more steps would be needed to curb the drug s misuse we have been concerned that the reformulation will not solve the bulk of the problem , he said dr david gauvin , a pharmacologist at the drug enforcement administration , said medical examiners in 30 states had so far reported about 1 , 010 overdose deaths involving oxycodone since january 2000 based on responses to date , the agency concluded that oxycontin was directly linked as a factor in 110 overdose deaths because tablets were either found in a person s stomach or a prescription for the drug was found on a body other confirmation came from reports on interviews with witnesses you may have had a credible witness who said , 'my son took oxycontin , and 20 minutes later he stopped breathing , ' dr gauvin said agency officials classified 172 deaths as oxycontin possible , cases where autopsy reports showed high blood concentrations of oxycodone without the presence of other compounds like aspirin or acetaminophen while oxycontin contains only oxycodone , other narcotics , like percodan and tylox , use the drug as an active ingredient but also include other compounds in 501 cases , the agency did not receive enough information to differentiate between oxycontin and oxycodone , its principal ingredient and the information in 227 of the 1 , 010 reports was insufficient to enable the agency to analyze them purdue pharma executives have defended their decision to distribute free oxycontin pills the company s salespeople gave doctors promotional material about oxycontin that contained cards , which doctors would then give to patients along with a oxycontin prescription a patient would bring the card to a pharmacy for free drugs michael friedman , the chief operating officer of purdue pharma , based in stamford , conn , said the sampling program was used to acquaint patients with oxycontin mr friedman said the company had begun a new card program in july but stopped it a few days later when the food and drug administration placed the highest possible warning on oxycontin s label asked why purdue continued to offer free supplies in the face of mounting reports of abuse , mr friedman said he believed that people who received the cards from doctors were legitimate patients he estimated that the company had run four or five similar marketing programs for the drug in recent years and that from 8 , 000 to 15 , 000 cards had been distributed each time the fact that we 're providing a sample to a patient has no connection to some criminal doctor who was taking money for prescriptions , mr friedman said terry woodworth , the deputy director of drug agency s division of diversion control , said purdue pharma s program did not violate the law but mr woodworth , who learned about purdue pharma s program from a reporter , said he was stunned to hear that the company continued it after reports about abuse it s absolutely absurd , mr woodworth said were they meeting the letter of the law \? sure were they meeting the intent and spirit \? no photo oxycontin , a potent painkiller , is popular with drug abusers \( associated press \)
charleston , sc , may 30 a lush and decadent nightclub run by gangsters , its walls covered in plush red velvet , was the setting for a puccini opera staged at this year s spoleto festival usa the characters included guntoting thugs in tuxedos , exotic dancers in fishnet stockings and a whiteslaver who branded his captives with a hot iron this production of puccini s rarely staged manon lescaut , which sprung from the mind of the director and designer petrika ionesco , may be far from what the composer envisioned but it delighted audiences here and showed why the spoleto festival , now celebrating its 25th anniversary , has become a major and evidently permanent feature of the american cultural landscape we want the flavor of what s new , what s vivid , what has a lot of energy , said nigel redden , the festival director people here can see everything from a 17thcentury opera to a 21stcentury music series we 're creating the entire span , and what we present is going to define the cultural context for the majority of our visitors more than 70 , 000 tickets have been sold for this year s festival , which runs through june 10 about 80 percent of the audience is from south carolina or other southeastern states , and for many if not most of them , spoleto is a crucial cultural experience it entertains and shapes the taste of an entire region certainly there has been an arts revival in the southeast in the 25 years since this festival began , said ellen dressler moryl , director of piccolo spoleto , a cityrun companion to the main festival people get inspired in charleston , the orchestra and ballet have gone from amateur to professional and increased their budget 10 times you see the same thing in community after community spoleto is the main factor there s been a huge spinoff effect the nontheatrical highlight of this year s festival was the announcement at city hall of a 25 million fundraising campaign to make the festival financially sound and buy and renovate a historic mansion for use as its new headquarters already 18 million has been raised we 've had a history of being stable and also not so stable , said joel smith , a local businessman who is a chairman of the fundraising drive the purpose of this is to take the bumps out of the road the spoleto festival is one of the very few in the united states that present a diverse mix of worldclass performers in a compressed time period , in this case 17 days there are dance festivals and music festivals and theater festivals spoleto presents all those forms and more this year s offerings are being presented on nearly a dozen charleston stages , most within walking distance of each other the variety is as rich as ever while manon lescaut was a dazzling visual feast , for example , the other opera , purcell s dido and aeneas , was spare and minimalist the director , chen shizheng , left the sloping stage bare except for a few archetypal objects like a stone and a leafless branch singers moved across it as if entranced both the bill t jones arnie zane dance company and the joffrey ballet of chicago were well received , but dance audiences reserved some of their loudest applause for the brenda angiel aerial dance company from argentina members of this troupe perform while attached to elastic ropes hanging from the ceiling they perform some routines entirely in the air , others by bouncing and twirling from air to floor the theatrical centerpiece was an overthetop slapstick version of a servant to two masters , an 18thcentury farce by the commedia dell'arte master carlo goldoni london s young vic royal shakespeare company made it one of the festival s hottest tickets it was staged as a raucous comedy , somewhere between i love lucy and the three stooges , with references to the beatles and monica lewinsky thrown in other popular events this year have included blood links , an engrossing personal history by the chineseaustralian performance artist william yang , and an outdoor concert by virginia rodrigues , a brazilian singer who is being called the latest great voice to emerge from her country among the shows to come are

now memories orbit around small things none of the other window washers liked his old green bucket , but jan demczur , who worked inside 1 world trade center , found its rectangular mouth perfect for dipping and wetting his squeegee in one motion so on the morning of the 11th , as he waited at the 44thfloor sky lobby to connect with elevators for higher floors , bucket and squeegee dangled from the end of his arm the time was 8 47 am with five other men shivam iyer , john paczkowski , george phoenix , colin richardson and another man whose identity could not be learned mr demczur \( pronounced demsir \) boarded car 69a , an express elevator that stopped on floors 67 through 74 the car rose , but before it reached its first landing , we felt a muted thud , mr iyer said the building shook the elevator swung from side to side , like a pendulum then it plunged in the car , someone punched an emergency stop button at that moment 8 48 am 1 world trade center had entered the final 100 minutes of its existence no one knew the clock was running , least of all the men trapped inside car 69a they were as cut off 500 feet in the sky as if they had been trapped 500 feet underwater they did not know their lives would depend on a simple tool after 10 minutes , a live voice delivered a blunt message over the intercom there had been an explosion then the intercom went silent smoke seeped into the elevator cabin one man cursed skyscrapers mr phoenix , the tallest , a port authority engineer , poked for a ceiling hatch others pried apart the car doors , propping them open with the long wooden handle of mr demczur s squeegee there was no exit they faced a wall , stenciled with the number 50 that particular elevator bank did not serve the 50th floor , so there was no need for an opening to escape , they would have to make one themselves mr demczur felt the wall sheetrock having worked in construction in his early days as a polish immigrant , he knew that it could be cut with a sharp knife no one had a knife from his bucket , mr demczur drew his squeegee he slid its metal edge against the wall , back and forth , over and over he was spelled by the other men against the smoke , they breathed through handkerchiefs dampened in a container of milk mr phoenix had just bought sheetrock comes in panels about one inch thick , mr demczur recalled they cut an inch , then two inches mr demczur s hand ached as he carved into the third panel , his hand shook , he fumbled the squeegee and it dropped down the shaft he had one tool left a short metal squeegee handle they carried on , with fists , feet and handle , cutting an irregular rectangle about 12 by 18 inches finally , they hit a layer of white tiles a bathroom they broke the tiles one by one , the men squirmed through the opening , headfirst , sideways , popping onto the floor near a sink mr demczur turned back i said , 'pass my bucket out , ' he recalled by then , about 9 30 , the 50th floor was already deserted , except for firefighters , astonished to see the six men emerge i think it was engine company 5 , mr iyer said they hustled us to the staircase on the excruciating singlefile descent through the smoke , someone teased mr demczur about bringing his bucket the company might not order me another one , he replied at the 15th floor , mr iyer said we heard a thunderous , metallic roar i thought our lives had surely ended then the south tower was collapsing it was 9 59 mr demczur dropped his bucket the firefighters shouted to hurry at 23 minutes past 10 , they burst onto the street , ran for phones , sipped oxygen and , five minutes later , fled as the north tower collapsed their escape had taken 95 of the 100 minutes it took up to one and a half minutes to clear each floor , longer at the lower levels , said mr iyer , an engineer with the port authority if the elevator had stopped at the 60th floor , instead of the 50th , we would have been five minutes too late and that man with the squeegee he was like our guardian angel since that day , mr demczur has stayed home with his wife and children he has pieced together the faces of the missing with the men and women he knew in the stations of his old life the security guard at the japanese bank on the 93rd floor , who used to let him in at 6 30 the people at carr futures on 92 the head of the port authority their faces keep him awake at night , he says his hands , the one that held the squeegee and the other that carried the bucket , shake with absence

with many forms of assistance available to victims of the destruction of the world trade center , officials yesterday urged those seeking help particularly the families of those killed or missing to use the central clearinghouse created for them , rather than try to contact city , state , federal and private agencies one at a time people can tap into services including some providing emergency cash , longterm financial support , counseling and legal services by going to the victims' service center at pier 94 in manhattan , at west 55th street , or contacting the center by phone information from interviews at the center is passed on to a wide range of agencies this saves the survivors from having to seek out each agency and repeatedly supply the same information new york state has set up service centers in each of the other four boroughs , but for those who have lost family members , officials say , the main victims' center is still the right place to start for many families of the dead , financial and legal affairs will be the most pressing here are some of the forms of aid available to them , all of which can be reached through the central number and at pier 94 the new york state crime victims board , through a joint federalstate program , will pay the families of those killed up to 600 a week , up to a total of 30 , 000 it also makes emergency cash grants , and helps pay for funeral expenses , medical expenses and counseling normally , emergency cash is limited to 1 , 500 and funeral assistance to 6 , 000 , but gov george e pataki has signed an executive order waiving those ceilings for trade center victims claims for benefits from the board must be made in person , at pier 94 or one of the board s 11 offices ordinarily , you would need a police report or some other official document showing that the person was a crime victim , but instead we 're asking people to fill out an affidavit of death or injury , said caroline quartararo , spokeswoman for the state s division of criminal justice services safe horizon , a private victimservices group , is making grants to people who would not qualify for money from the crime victims board or other major sources elizabeth mccarthy , senior vice president of the group , said this would include , for example , a person whose domestic partner died in the attack , or an adult whose father was killed but whose stepmother had already claimed government benefits the grants are being made through one of the first disbursements , 700 , 000 , from the september 11 fund created by the united way and the new york community trust the fund had raised 110 million as of friday social security benefits are among the easiest and fastest to obtain to qualify , a family must have lost an earner who had paid social security taxes , and who left minor children or a surviving spouse who is 60 or older the social security administration has invoked a disaster policy that speeds the processing of claims and waives the usual demands for documenting a person s death , said tom tobin , a spokesman our expedited process allows us to accept the lists of employees that we 've gotten from employers , or an airline manifest , as proof of death at the outset , mr tobin said or we would accept a statement from someone who can place the person at that location at the time of the attack benefits vary , based on factors like the income of the person who died for a spouse living with two children under 16 , the average benefit would be 1 , 700 a month , mr tobin said for the support of a child 16 to 18 or 16 to 19 if still in high school on turning 18 the average benefit would be 575 a month for a surviving spouse 60 or older , with no minor children at home , the average benefit would be 815 a month new york state s workers' compensation board pays up to 400 a week to the families of people killed or disabled on the job for firefighters , the maximum is 800 a week surviving spouses collect that benefit for the rest of their lives , and surviving children until they turn 18 , or until they turn 23 if they are fulltime students if a firefighter s surviving spouse remarries , the weekly payment is replaced by a lump sum of up to 83 , 200 the united states department of justice pays a lump sum of 151 , 635 to the family of any police officer , firefighter or emergency medical worker killed in the line of duty department officials say that in the case of the sept 11 attacks , families should not have to take any action to receive payment , because the department has learned about those who were killed from employers the federal emergency management agency is making assistance available through the state department of labor , including help with funeral expenses , replacement of lost property and payment of medical costs the total benefit is capped at 14 , 400 per family but people can tap into that aid only if they have exhausted the help of volunteer agencies like the american red cross , and their own insurance policies plans are afoot for scholarships for family members of people killed in the terror attacks , to attend the state university of new york , the city

foot , he pounds down the clutch with his fist , he slams the gear shift into second , then third , then fourth the engine howls , then wheezes , howls and wheezes in six seconds of a heavymetal symphony of muscle and motion , mr preston s red 1986 chrysler laser hits 60 in 14 seconds , he goes a quarter of a mile when you used that clutch in my '61 impala , you ended up with a calf that looked like popeye s , mr preston said i believe that rolling a fourspeed is an art form it s something you have to think about it s not godgiven but the laser with its manual transmission is a 20thcentury artifact , and so might be most rubberpeeling popeyes the true clutchequipped , stickshifting manual transmission even today called the standard transmission has shrunk to a mere toy six decades since the debut of the oldsmobile hydramatic , the demise of the manual transmission has accelerated , forced along by stopandgo highways , brutal commutes , hardtohandle cell phones and , most recently , makebelieve fivespeeds that do not even have clutches i would n't say it s necessarily our objective to phase out the stick , said matt kester , a spokesman for general motors powertrain , the gm division that makes engines and transmissions it s a cultural issue , mr kester said it s just that much more work to operate a stick shift other developments are undermining the stick cars with automatic transmissions usually cost 500 to 1 , 000 more than stickshift cars , but that gap is shrinking and manual transmissions used to be peppier and more fuel efficient than their automatic counterparts now , automatics , governed by sophisticated computers , are burning gas more wisely that fuel economy penalty is largely disappearing , said paul taylor , chief economist at the national automobile dealers association in washington hertz , avis and national no longer carry cars with manual transmissions state motor vehicle regulators do not require training in stick shifts , and high school driver education programs do not offer it some driving schools do , but they charge a premium for it at the extremes of the marketplace , the 9 , 000to 15 , 000 barebones lowpowered cars and sporty 40 , 000andup highperformance road burners , drivers can still readily find manual transmissions but by last year , according to ward s automotive reports , manual transmissions accounted for just 87 percent of cars made in the united states , down from 124 percent in 1996 two decades ago , 20 to 25 percent of all new vans had manual transmissions , the environmental protection agency reports now none do ten percent of sport utility vehicles have stick shifts , compared with 40 percent of similar vehicles in 1975 throaty mustangs , camaros and trans ams , a new lincoln ls and a volvo v70 have them but they have disappeared from popular fullsize cars like the ford taurus and the pontiac bonneville and from all buicks last year , chrysler dropped them from the jeep cherokee curt preston works at the midatlantic s high temple of transmission service and repair , glen burnie transmissions , a 40yearold business on ritchie highway in glen burnie , a suburb south of baltimore chain operators like aamco are bigger , but marvin keyser , 72 , the owner and cofounder , says his suppliers tell him the shop , with its 24 bays and 50 mechanics , is the biggest in the nation under one roof the mechanics here say an automatic is still no match for a stick you can keep control of the power better , mr preston said you can use the engine to pull it down slowing the car by shifting to a lower gear rather than relying solely on the brakes and wearing them down they also last a lot longer than automatics , mr preston said repair usually entails little more than replacing a clutch , at a cost of 100 to 300 today s much more complex electroniccontrolled automatics require more work , typically costing 900 or more but cars with manual transmissions have declined to less than 4 percent of all those the shop sees even the mechanics here prefer automatics only 10 of the 50 drive stick shifts one of the two who specialize in servicing sticks , jack bell , drives a ford 150 pickup with an automatic transmission until he bought that , he said , i had three or four cars with sticks but on the highway outside baltimore , he said , they 're terrible you go two feet , push the clutch , go two feet , push the clutch , he added the dominance of automatic transmissions is an american phenomenon , mr kester of general motors said they have captured only 12 percent of the european market europeans drive cars americans eat , drink and live in them during everlonger commutes they also talk , and the impossibility of shifting , steering and dialing a cell phone has further imperiled the stick the european mindset , mr kester , is a , you ca n't get good mileage with an automatic , and b , only weenies drive them i do n't want to be stereotyping , he added , but europeans prefer the acoustic acceleration experience , whereas for americans the big selling point is a quiet car
east rutherford , nj , april 20 earlier in this startling series , goalie arturs irbe left his carolina net several times to crash into attacking devils although he appears to be smaller than his alleged 5 feet 8 and 190 pounds , irbe acted aggressively while his team fell behind by three games to none in the eastern conference quarterfinals he barged into randy mckay and patrik elias and got into a penalized roughing match with petr sykora irbe said these physical confrontations occur when the timing is right , but tonight was not one of those times irbe turned down several opportunities for combat , including the one when scott gomez was penalized for falling on him instead , irbe concentrated on stopping 37 of 39 shots in a 32 carolina victory that cut the devils' series lead to three games to two i had to save energy , irbe said i could n't brawl he was voted first star and expressed optimism as the series headed back to raleigh for game 6 sunday afternoon a 10year veteran of the national hockey league and a native of latvia , irbe played for the san jose sharks when they upset the detroit red wings in 1994 in the first round ousting the devils , the current stanley cup champions and eastern conference champions , after losing the first three games would be an accomplishment of even greater magnitude it s been a long time , irbe said of that 1994 series against detroit it s hard to compare obviously , we are just clinging to our lives we can continue to play this way there is some momentum during the regular season , the 34yearold irbe led all goalies in games with 77 and was tied for third in victories with 37 he started 40 consecutive games is he tired \? not tonight i guess i had extra jump in my legs , extra springs , he said i hope nobody accuses me of cheating by putting extra springs in there no , but he has some strangelooking equipment that looks like general issue from the soviet union , circa 1975 he wears an oldfashioned white birdcage helmet that is hardly a fashion statement and big , white leg pads that he carries with him from team to team and mends himself he leaves most of his equipment on the bench during intermissions sometimes , he does unexpected things paul maurice , the carolina coach , smiled when recalling three or four big hits this year that irbe has delivered he s thrown some dandies , maurice said , adding that one on kent manderville of philadelphia has got to rank right up there with all our hits from our defensemen i'm not sure that i love to see that , maurice added i like archie in his groove we 'd like to cut down on his openice body checks usually , that shows more frustration than anything else he s not afraid nor did he show fear when the devils buzzed him with multiple volleys on one of them , in the second period , he blanked alexander mogilny from the slot , then beat gomez on the rebound in the third period , he stymied john madden martin brodeur , less busy at the other end , said irbe is the reason why we 're going to carolina hopefully , he is not going to be the reason why we come back here for a game 7
washington , dec 2 the war against terrorism has created some novel pitches from washington lobbyists , now swarming over the capital as congress tries to wrap up its business for the year the american traffic safety services association , whose members make traffic signs , is arguing that more federal money is needed for road signs to prevent traffic jams after terror attacks california date growers have petitioned the white house and the pentagon to buy dates for food packages being dropped in afghanistan they would be a treat for the afghans during ramadan , the growers maintain since sept 11 , many other business lobbyists have taken old pleas for federal help and turned them into new arguments for spending to combat terrorism representative edward j markey , democrat of massachusetts , is amused by the efforts to profit from patriotism no selfrespecting lobbyist , he said , has not repackaged his position as a patriotic response to the tragedy this , he said , is what he is hearing the challenge is terrorism the answer is reestablish telecommunications monopolies the challenge is terrorism the answer is to drill for oil in the arctic wildlife refuge the challenge is terrorism the answer is a 15 billion retroactive tax break to scores of corporations the minute he arrived at work on the morning of sept 12 , a top aide to a democratic senator recalled , he received a call from a lobbyist for the airline industry pushing for a repeal of the federal tax on jet fuel to help the industry in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks over the next few days , the aide said , reading from his desk calendar and telephone logs , he heard from representatives of the travel , insurance , telecommunications and software industries , from lobbyists for farmers , pharmaceutical companies and manufacturers , and from several military contractors none of them asked for anything different from what they had sought from congress before , the aide said , but all had new pitches presenting their cases as responses to the attacks until sept 11 , money was scarce president bush and congress had said they would save the surplus in the social security accounts but now , fiscal discipline has been played down , budget deficits are the order of the day and companies , unions and the range of interest groups want a slice of a vast new stimulusmilitarybioterrorismhomeland defense pie the idea of making money from the attacks sounds so crass that few lobbyists are willing to talk about it openly but james albertine , a lobbyist who represents companies , trade associations and nonprofit organizations , was remarkably frank what happened was a tragedy , certainly , but there are opportunities , mr albertine said we 're in business this is not a charity paul c light , director of government studies at the brookings institution , put it directly this is the best of times for lobbyists , mr light said all of a sudden , they are in a position where they can sell their clients on the possibility of success some of the lobbyists have such clear cases that their clients were damaged by the terrorism and need immediate relief that the government has already come through or seems very likely to the 15 billion package of aid and loan guarantees for the airline industry , enacted in september , is an example , although some critics have assailed its size insurance companies , which were busily lobbying in the house last week , can expect some form of federal protection against large losses from future terrorist attacks , although it remains unclear what form the aid will take new york city has a strong claim for federal assistance to rebuild the devastated area , though the amount of money that will be available is a matter of considerable dispute as for economic stimulus , the republican package the house of representatives approved in october was made up principally of corporate tax breaks larger writeoffs for investments in plants and equipment , retroactive repeal of the alternative minimum tax , tax savings for financial services companies with operations abroad and a lower capital gains tax michael baroody , chief lobbyist for the national association of manufacturers , made this argument for how cutting corporate taxes would help revive the economy companies are either going to invest the extra money in equipment , or they 're going to invest it in jobs but even mr baroody , who put together a coalition of corporate lobbyists to press for prospective repeal of the minimum tax a measure enacted in 1986 to make sure profitable companies could not escape income taxes did not defend the house plan for repealing it retroactively that plan , denounced by democrats , would result in hundreds of millions of dollars in tax refunds to corporations , including international business machines , general motors and general electric here are some other commercial interests that have adjusted their pitches in response to the attacks the travel industry is seeking a temporary 1 , 000 tax credit per family to help offset vacation expenses boeing , with the marine corps , is pressing congress and the pentagon to revive the v22 osprey , an experimental aircraft that has been grounded because of fatal crashes verizon communications wants to lift federal rules that give smaller competitors access to its network the company argues that its success in restoring telephone service to lower manhattan demonstrates the importance to the nation of large telecommunications companies farm lobbyists are portraying a subsidy bill as a safety net for farmers in the recession and a bulwark against disruptions in food supplies in war time once called the agriculture act of 2001 , it has been renamed the farm security act of 2001 many , maybe most , of these proposals will never become law or public policy but that is not so important to lobbyists , said charles peters , the founding editor of the washington monthly magazine and a cryptographer of the codes of washington i can hear them saying , 'oh , god , we fought hard on this amendment , ' mr peters said 'we got it through the house that s worth another 2 million in billing' when the senate took up a bill to extend the moratorium on sales taxes on purchases over the internet , both sides tried to take advantage of how times had changed those who wanted to end the moratorium said states needed the sales tax revenue because of their new expenses for homeland security and those who wanted to continue the moratorium said taxes would further depress sales that have dropped since sept 11 photo lobbyists , including mike dineen , in dark suit , and mike miller of kemper insurance , waited outside the capitol last week insurance companies will probably receive federal protection against terrorism losses \( susana raab for the new york times \) \( pg b7 \)
termit , gaza strip , dec 18 his friends were wishing the israeli lieutenant happy birthday over the telephone just after midnight this morning when , with a flash and a roomshaking boom , an antitank grenade burst outside this lonely , scarred israeli outpost , which separates a palestinian refugee camp from the border with egypt yelling for the location of the grenade s source , the lieutenant dashed to the sniper post and began shooting into the darkness , joining with machinegun fire from an armored vehicle outside that was already pounding the shattered margins of the refugee camp , which is called rafah on the night after yasir arafat ordered a complete and immediate halt of all armed operations , palestinian bullets and grenades flew out of the darkness here , as usual , and israeli soldiers fired back the fighting , flaring almost nightly , and sometimes daily as well , reflects the chaotic nature of the conflict , which can seem less like a clash of national aspirations than an evocation of lord of the flies but here , the clash between palestinians and youthful israelis has its own particular twist the combatants on both sides are muslims almost all the israeli soldiers here , in what is considered the hottest flash point of the conflict , are from a battalion composed of bedouins generally hebrew and arabicspeaking muslims who are israeli citizens they are men in the middle , vulnerable to attack from many directions shouting in arabic across the wasteland , the palestinians call them traitors , and sometimes the egyptians do , too some of their fellow bedouins say the same the fighting takes place on a moonscape of crushed or bulletriddled homes israelis say this land is shot through with palestinian tunnels and littered with increasingly sophisticated palestinian bombs off duty , the bedouin israelis who man this outpost are accustomed to having identification cards demanded by others protecting israel s security one bedouin soldier returning to duty two months ago in a private car was beaten by other israeli soldiers , who suspected him of being a terrorist on a bombing mission , officers said the man ended up in the hospital , and his family insisted that he leave the army here , they smoke tea when the cigarettes run out , talk movies , and avoid calling home for fear grenades or guns will erupt in the background , waiting without television or running water in a frigid threestory building that stands alone between rafah and egypt it is a mission that one outside officer described as guarding the border and trying not to get killed isolated for weeks at a time in the position , which can be reached only by armored personnel carrier , the soldiers are here to stop anyone from crossing in either direction , and to fight when necessary it s a dead zone , said natan lavan , a 20yearold paramedic serving with the unit here whoever goes on this border , dies his commander said the israelis fired only at people who are considered apparent threats the commander is not bedouin , but his deputy is , and some of the men hope that one day he will take over several soldiers said they preferred to be here , where the action was , rather than in a cushier , duller post they said they were doing their duty the israeli army permitted a journalist to spend a night here but imposed some conditions it insisted that the size of the force not be published and that some weaponry and surveillance equipment not be described the deputy commander , who is 23 years old , said he would not describe the clashes here as war i would n't say , 'war , ' i 'd say 'constant fighting , ' he said you get side bombs , you get grenades thrown at you , they fire at you he said he thought the aim of the palestinians was psychological , to harass the israelis and to demonstrate to the world that they were fighting one israeli soldier was shot to death here early in the conflict several have been injured at least one of them was seriously injured , by an antitank grenade fired at his bulldozer the coverage of the current conflict between israelis and palestinians is so systematized that the israeli army runs a pager service to update journalists on the fighting one of the most frequent messages is that one or two or 10 grenades have been thrown near this post on one recent night , the soldiers logged 200 explosions one afternoon in rafah last month , after an enormous boom outside , sharif abd al al , 14 , came running back to his home , grinning and smelling of gunpowder he had just flung a grenade at an israeli armored vehicle that , impervious , could be heard snorting and clanking along the border nearby asked why he threw the grenade , which could not harm the vehicle or the soldiers inside , sharif smiled and shrugged pressed , he said he wanted to avenge the deaths of two friends who he said were killed by israeli soldiers the grenades , he said , at least frightened the soldiers they are very scared , that s what i think , he said sharif said that , to make a grenade , he and his friends had a plumber cut sections of pipe , closed at one end and threaded at the other they filled the pipes with fertilizer some use gunpowder , israelis say and screwed on tops each pipe was scored so the metal would fragment the youths stuffed firecrackers for detonators into a small hole in the top in all , sharif said , the weapons cost a little more than 3 apiece to manufacture
chicago , dec 11 the seconds were ticking down in the first quarter when the nets reserve guard lucious harris dribbled the ball across the top of the arc , bobbled it , stumbled and collected the ball again he thought about passing it , but when harris saw there were two seconds remaining , he heaved a shot while falling backward the shot dropped in at the buzzer , jolting his teammates harris s 3pointer brought the nets back from a 10point deficit and into a 2727 tie with the chicago bulls it typified the nets' changed fortunes this season they seem to create their own luck , turning mistakes into opportunities and convincing victories harris spurred his teammates on a 170 run that carried well into the second quarter and helped the nets defeat the bulls , 10793 , in front of 16 , 892 tonight in the united center harris scored 20 of his gamehigh 22 points in the first half , none more important than his dramatic 3pointer i think that really propelled us , harris said i think it gave us some energy that we did n't have at the start of the game that s what the bench is supposed to do i got a fire going and we just kept it going harris made all seven of his shots in the first half the reserve rookie forward richard jefferson added 16 points the nets' bench scored 52 points jason kidd scored 10 of his 17 points in the third quarter , enabling the nets to maintain their lead in the atlantic division by half a game over the boston celtics the nets took another step in establishing their pedigree tonight it proved we learned an early lesson coming out prepared against teams like this , coach byron scott said it carried out our objective to beat the teams we should beat we 've got to do that the rest of the season the nets entered this game knowing that the bulls could be ripe for revenge after the nets' 32point drubbing of them on nov 27 still , they fell behind by 10 points midway through the first quarter when harris spelled kerry kittles with 1 minute 52 seconds left in the quarter and the nets trailing by 4 , harris made the difference his 3point shot not only rescued the nets from a lackluster first quarter , it seemed to ignite his game that gave us a wakeup call that we were lucky to be tied going into the second quarter , kidd said harris hit an open 3pointer to begin the second quarter , jumpstarting a 140 nets run that lasted until the 7 48 mark when the bulls cut the deficit to 7 , harris hit two jumpers he hit another one with 247 seconds remaining , for his 15th point of the quarter , giving the nets a 12point lead at halftime he was hot , kidd said when he s in a zone like that , i just need to get him the ball the nets stayed hot , extending their lead to 17 points in the third quarter they let it dwindle to 9 early in the fourth quarter before getting it back to double digits harris had already made his impact in the first half , leading the reserves and lifting the nets out of their malaise most of the credit goes to the bench , scott said harris s unexpected lift was exactly what the nets needed tonight , both in the game and in the standing rebounds at tuesday morning s shootaround , coach byron scott blasted his top rookie , richard jefferson , for his poor defense then jefferson disproved his coach s words during tuesday night s game guys are beating him so easy right now , it s scary , scott had said he is so worried about his offense that he s taking everything else for granted jefferson sprained the medial collateral ligament in his left knee in a game against the los angeles clippers on nov 22 he returned five games ago he said the injury was still affecting his play , even if scott did not take that as an excuse am i 100 percent \? jefferson said tuesday morning no , i am not am i defending the way i was before \? no , i am not no , but my body is n't feeling the way it was i'm not playing the way i was before but i will soon jefferson scored 16 points , the most since his return to the lineup he shot 7 of 10 with four assists and three rebounds in 23 minutes richard was back to being richard jefferson again , scott said jefferson said he was motivated by scott s words it was definitely on my mind , he said i changed a few things how i approached the game , and luckily things went well
weekday mornings at 6 15 , 15yearold christina deleon arrives at hempstead high school in her green camouflage uniform to begin 45 minutes of calisthenics and marching drill the company s student commander barks orders under the watchful eye of donald moore jr , who retired from the marines as a major and , with his booming voice and shaved head , appears to have lost none of his formidability mr moore signed on to become the first military instructor of hempstead s marine junior reserve officer training corps program , which the high school established in september 2000 hempstead is the newest of long island s eight jrotc programs , which attempt to give high school students an early military education but do n't require a commitment to join the armed forces all four branches of the military have programs on long island for example , brentwood s jrotc program is affiliated with the air force , lindenhurst s with the marines , wyandanch s with the army and riverhead s with the navy each program is tailored to the service with which it is aligned navy classes include maritime heritage , navigation and seamanship , while air force classes include the history of aviation and aerospace science but local jrotc representatives say the programs' main goal is to teach leadership , citizenship and selfdiscipline the events of sept 11 have inspired some jrotc students to become even more committed to their dream of military service , and one of the instructors reported that the cadets were now more accepted by their peers , who were sometimes skeptical about the cleancut teenagers in their crisply pressed uniforms the berkeley attitude is gone , said bill grigonis , another retired marine major who is the senior instructor at the southoldmattituck navy jrotc program no one is making fun of these kids now everyone s glad to have them but some cadets confided that fears of a prolonged war on terrorism have caused them to reconsider their plans to enlist some expressed fear of death and said the reality of life in the armed forces was a frightening prospect taneka braithwaite , 17 , a hempstead high senior who had considered a military career , dropped out of the school s jrotc several days after sept 11 , citing her religious convictions , objections from her parents and the terrorist attacks she turned down a navy rotc scholarship that would have financed her college education in return for four years of military service sept 11 helped make my decision final , she said seeing what happened made me realize i needed to enjoy my life more and that i had to spend more time practicing my religion patchoguemedford high school s air force jrotc instructor , robert atkinson , spent 19 years in the marines while he supports students who want to enter the armed forces , he counsels them about the pitfalls i tell them they 're getting a job that involves physical danger , the 54yearold retired colonel and vietnam veteran said i do n't want to see them get all gungho like they 're going to a saturday nightclub it s a dangerous job before sept 11 , jrotc enrollment on long island had been rising , reflecting a national trend wyandanch s program had 28 cadets in 1996 now it has 110 patchogue has 145 cadets this year , up from 81 in 1996 at southold high school , the cadets interviewed showed little doubt or fear about their futures in the military dressed in immaculate black navy uniforms , many displayed medals earned for academic honors and community service the company has 101 students from three different schools , southold , mattituck and greenport two mattituck students sean pillai and christopher symczak , both 17 are seeking navy rotc scholarships or appointments to the united states naval academy their company commander , lauren hubbard , also 17 and from southhold , is forgoing college and has already enlisted in the navy s delayed entry program he is scheduled to report for basic training next september mr grigonis , 38 , was a jrotc cadet and graduated from southold high school in 1981 his 20 years in the marines took him all over the world , but he said he was excited to return to his alma mater as a naval science instructor in september like the other instructors , his salary is split between the school district and the service to which the program is affiliated back in those early postvietnam years , mr grigonis recalled , jrotc got little respect and the program went through eight instructors when he was a cadet thankfully the culture of america has changed , he said maybe not so much at a recent morning meeting , some of the hempstead jrotc students were wearing uniforms while others were dressed in baggy pants and tshirts everything s a fashion statement at this school , said miss deleon more people would join if the uniform had bellbottoms mr moore said miss deleon is one of his most dedicated cadets , possibly a future company commander but before joining jrotc last year , she was someone who by her own admission was heading in the wrong direction she said she was having difficulty adjusting to her parents' divorce and frequently cut classes when her best friend became pregnant , miss deleon said her s mother , virginia , began pushing her to join the jrotc program , hoping it would give her the structure she was lacking now she wakes up at 5 am every day , and yes ma'am and no sir have become regular parts of her speech people told me i'm crazy , that joining the company is n't worth it , miss deleon said well , it s been worth it to me but some instructors stressed that while the programs can help troubled adolescents , it s not a dumping ground for wayward teenagers this program is not going to magically instill discipline , it s not structured for remediation , said dwight becherer , the instructor of the jrotc program at william floyd high school in mastic beach mr becherer added that while the program was a godsend for some youngsters , others refuse to take it seriously and drop the elective after freshman year those who continue with the program , often credit jrotc with transforming their lives a hempstead cadet , jorge alguera , 17 , is planning to enlist in the marines when he turns 18 , and his classmate , elvis moricete , 17 , is already in the marine delayed entry program and reports for duty after graduation mr alguera , an immigrant from costa rica who came to new york at age 11 , said he wants to serve as a role model for nativeborn americans to demonstrate that even someone born outside the united states can faithfully serve this country lawrence taylor , 16 , a wyandanch high school junior and an army jrotc cadet , immigrated to the united states from jamaica in 1998 and cringes when other students criticize his dream to become an air force pilot because he is n't a citizen yet i could n't believe that people still thought like that , he said this country has given me a place to eat and a place to live why not help the country \? i feel like i owe them photos bill grigonis , above , senior instructor at the southoldmattituck navy jrotc at hempstead high school , left , cadets practice a

allahabad , india , jan 24 first into the sacred waters were the naga sadhus the naked mystics a powder of ceremonial ashes anointing their bodies and swords and tridents brandished in their hands the more modest among them wore loincloths , though none any wider than the tail of a kite following them toward the ritual bathing platforms were the bearded gurus , seated on great ornamental thrones that were pulled by tractors favored disciples hovered near , protecting the revered sages with gilded parasols and finally the procession was given over to the pilgrims then more and more of them and more yet and still more they numbered in the millions , all on a personal search for the divine , there for a miraculous dip into the bracing chill of the merging rivers officials variously put the number at 20 million to 30 million , enough to temporarily make historic allahabad into one of the biggest cities in the world but people were spread widely across a vast riverside flood plain any count was seatofthepants guesswork the faithful had come for the gargantuan hindu festival known as the purna kumbh mela it is a sixweek fling , and it began on jan 9 according to the astrological positions of the sun , the moon and jupiter , this morning s predawn offered the most auspicious moments of the most auspicious day in this most auspicious of events and allahabad is considered among india s most auspicious cities , home to the sangam , the confluence of three holy rivers , two of them real , the ganges and the yamuna , and one that exists only in myth , the saraswati how a bath here makes one feel is beyond words , beyond even thought , said one pilgrim , ravindra sharma , 72 , a retired government employee the water flows through you the water surrounds you but that does n't explain it it s beyond explaining the pilgrims , themselves an assortment of ages and occupations , arrived with an assortment of beliefs and expectations some said the immersion vouchsafed them eternal salvation , freeing them from the cycle of birth , death and reincarnation some said it cleansed them of all sin some said it simply refreshed the spirit whatever the reason , they arrived in multitudes , lined up on the thin and bumpy roads , jostling in the chaotic train stations the greatest numbers were woefully poor but highly portable in bundles held on their heads , they carried blankets , cooking utensils and enough food for however long the stay they slept on the sandy ground wherever weariness overtook them the notion of pilgrimage is a powerful lodestar in predominantly hindu india , a country of more than a billion people the religion s mythology comes alive within the nation s borders gods reside in the himalayas , and the lifegiving ganges and yamuna , which start in these heavenly mountains , ripple across india s vast northern plain the origins of the kumbh mela reside in the ancient memory of this mythology by legend , gods and demons churned the primeval ocean , summoning treasures from the depths the gods made off with most of the riches , but there was a fight for the final bounty , the coveted kumbh , or pitcher , which contained the nectar of immortality in a chase toward heaven , some of the elixir was spilled onto what are presentday allahabad , hardwar , ujjian and nashik marking them as special places each of these cities has a purna kumbh mela at 12year intervals historians say the practice dates back centuries , and the mela , or festival , has commonly included a conclave of the powerful swamis , gurus and yogis of the day in recent years , the events seem to be growing ever larger it has now become routine for the organizers to hail each one as the largest religious gathering of all time to be here is to be with all these holy men , ashi nath das , 61 , a retired salesman , said while in the midst of his purposeful bath you listen to them reading the holy texts , hear them speak you learn and after all , the reason for human life is to worship god the kumbh is part religious observance and part fair , and the property itself takes on many aspects of a fairground vendors sell peanuts in bags made from scraps of newspaper a hurdygurdy man shows off a pet monkey that does headstands overhead flies a huge blue balloon , beseeching the faithful to drink nescafe hundreds of hindu sects have been given their own campsites erected before some of them are huge facades with blinking lights and largerthanlife paintings of an esteemed guru some billboards and leaflets are written with exceptional confidence , one promising the only true teacher of the world , another the science of absolute knowledge if the festival had a main street , it would be the one housing the major akharas , or religious schools their holy men are the ones who lead the procession to the bathing ghats , using an assigned order in the past , the devout have occasionally engaged in fisticuffs about the pecking order for the most

new brunswick if a menu contains the words smothered , covered , battered and fried , it s likely that the food is traditional southern soul at delta s , it s a certainty you can eat fried crayfish for an appetizer and fried catfish for dinner you choose two sides with your entree , and the sides include macaroni and cheese and collard greens with few exceptions , the food served at delta s is southern home cooking , reminiscent of some of my favorite meals at my grandmother s house in mississippi but my grandmother never draped the kitchen table in white cloth or put a wineglass on it and i never heard any live oldiebluesy tunes during lunch or dinner there but there we were at delta s , wines poured , appetizers served , and toes tapping to ode to billie joe too bad none of us was quick enough to sing pass the biscuits , please , because they were served alongside the corn bread as a starter delta s , says willie stafford , the executive chef , is an oldtimey supper club , a place to meet and eat and to be entertained for the evening certainly this multilevel , balconied establishment next door to the frog and the peach is filling a niche in the new brunswick restaurant scene most tables were full during weeknight and weekend visits and the food is a trip back in time , to fish fries at the lake and fallingoffthebone sweet pork ribs with potato salad and slowcooked green beans for dinner only we ate corn bread with our meals , and biscuits were just for breakfast so i'm glad to find a place to evoke my childhood , and one that offers very good versions of a few favorite dishes crab cakes so full of lump and jumbo lump crab meat that they fall apart when touched with a fork baby back ribs , tender and juicy and sticky with sauce and a dinner made up of sides , at 4 per choice since there s no vegetable plate on the menu but the combination of live music and white tablecloths ca n't transform the food mr stafford is serving homestyle southern food , and it looks a little funny against a backdrop of white cloth even the notion of wine is debatable if he wants to match the elegant surroundings , he needs to show more imagination on the menu , more consistency from the kitchen and less dependence on the fryer i can see some imagination in the duck confit and turnip green spring roll , a fried concoction that blends duck , chicken and vegetables , then swings the taste south with the turnip greens the hot dipping sauce counters the sweetness of the carrots as well as the oil of the egg roll , making the dish moderately successful i like the idea of pecancrusted salmon , a southern twist to the ubiquitous fish , though i have n't yet had a chance to sample itthe vegetable lasagna , with its compilation of collard greens , zucchini , squash , carrots , broccoli and portobello mushrooms , tastes more like a halfhearted attempt to please a troublemaking vegetarian than a true effort and surely there are more interesting appetizers than buffalo wings and shrimp cocktail but interesting is subjective , and it kills consistency , says mr stafford , 56 , who attended the culinary institute of america from 1977 to 1979 i have hispanic and africanamerican cooks , so everybody has his or her way of doing something , he said we had to develop recipes , down to the potato salad , but even now , i 'll monitor , and i 'll look at the flour we 're frying chicken in , and suddenly , it s a different color someone is putting in poultry seasoning the same goes for the mashed potatoes a southerner makes mashed potatoes with milk , salt , butter and black pepper , but i 've got a guy who works for me from the hilton he wants to add chives ! i would n't complain about chives , but lack of consistency and inattention to detail does lower the overall quality of mr stafford s food one night , the collard greens were perfect , vaguely sweet and smoky another night , they were so salty and hot they were inedible the garden salad served with the lasagna arrived in an ocean of syrupy dressing , and the gumbo was more murky than marvelous and of little interest despite its ingredients of chicken , shrimp , andouille , okra , peppers and onions i found only one actual frying mistake with the fried chicken inside , the meat was tender and juicy , cooked perfectly , but instead of the crackling , crunchy exterior , there was a stretchy , brownish layer of chicken skin , something to leave on the plate the other frying issue is one of quantity there s too much fatty food on this menu it needs balance , and not just from the other main alternative , smothering one standout is the underpinnings for a slab of fried whiting the shrimp and chicken jambalaya grits it s a delightful blend of creamy , sweet , hot and savory , and could stand alone as an entree then there are the desserts , which , in southern cuisine , are what can make a cook s reputation a quick scan turns up no threelayer fresh coconut cake or homemade ice cream or chess pie or lane cake or pralines or key lime pie or lemon meringue pie but there are three desserts made in house sweet potato cheesecake , peach cobbler and banana pudding i order , the cobbler arrives and eagerly , i push my spoon in woe , woe ! the crust is doughy and thin and what s beneath looks more like broth than pie small pieces of peaches float in a watery brown bath not even the ice cream melting fetchingly on top can save this dish the cheesecake is a formidable slab of creamy deliciousness , though the crust fails the crispness test the standout is the simple banana pudding vanilla pudding layered with sliced bananas and vanilla wafers , piled so high in a dessert glass that it was dribbling down the sides and onto that white tablecloth delta s 15 dennis street , new brunswick \( 732 \) 2491551 satisfactory atmosphere home cooking meets white tablecloths and live music service friendly and enthusiastic smoking allowed at the bar wine list a respectable selection recommended dishes crab cakes , baby back ribs , herbroasted chicken , fried whiting over shrimp and chicken jambalaya grits , macaroni and cheese , grilled asparagus , mashed potatoes , banana pudding price range appetizers , 450 to 15 entrees , 15 to 25 hours tuesdays through thursdays , 5 pm to midnight fridays and saturdays , 5 pm to 2 am sundays , brunch 11 am to 3 pm and dinner at to 9 pm credit cards all major reservations recommended for fridays and saturdays wheelchair access the restaurant is on multiple levels , but the restaurant will set up seating on a single level ratings poor , fair , satisfactory , good , very good , excellent , extraordinary ratings reflect the reviewer s reaction to food , ambience and service , with price taken into consideration menu listings and prices are subject to change photo \( nancy wegard for the new york times \)

washington , may 16 the fbi director , louis j freeh , acknowledged at a congressional hearing today that his agency had committed a serious error when it failed to turn over thousands of pages of interview reports in the oklahoma city bombing case to lawyers for timothy j mcveigh , who was sentenced to death for the crime mr freeh said at the house hearing that he had ordered immediate corrective steps , among them a oneday agencywide suspension of all routine fbi functions in order to retrain employees in records management in addition , he said he had begun a search to hire a worldclass records expert in his first public comments on the bureau s lapse , mr freeh offered a detailed account of how the breakdown occurred but even as he acknowledged the mishandling of the documents , he echoed comments of attorney general john ashcroft that none of the material would undercut the guilty verdict against mr mcveigh , who was convicted of the 1995 bombing , which killed 168 people the fbi committed a serious error by not ensuring that every piece of information was properly accounted for and , when appropriate , provided to the prosecutors so that they could fulfill their discovery obligations , mr freeh told the appropriations subcommittee that oversees justice department spending it was our unquestionable obligation to identify every document regardless of where it was generated and regardless of where in our many , many offices it resided , he added the disclosure of the lapse last week led mr ashcroft to delay mr mcveigh s execution until june 11 the death sentence had been scheduled to be carried out today by lethal injection at the federal prison in terre haute , ind the government has not made public any of the documents at issue , saying they are subject to an order by the trial judge that prohibits disclosure lawyers for mr mcveigh , who have received copies of the documents , have said they are reviewing their legal options , including seeking a possible further delay of the execution lawyers for terry l nichols , who was sentenced to life in prison for his role in the bombing , have also been given the documents , and have cited them in an effort to revive an appeal of mr nichols s conviction but mr freeh said that the documents would not alter the outcome of the case several lawyers and agents from the justice department and the fbi conducted a pagebypage review of the material , mr freeh said nothing in the documents raises any doubt about the guilt of mcveigh and nichols for mr freeh , who is resigning next month , today s testimony near the end of his tumultuous eightyear tenure seemed like a reprise of many such congressional hearings , during which he has faced the bright television lights and angry questions of lawmakers in the aftermath of an fbi failure i am not here to minimize our mistakes or to make excuses , mr freeh said , admitting that 16 requests to the bureau s offices to turn in all documents had failed to yield full disclosure of every document in the oklahoma city case mr freeh said he issued a directive on friday ordering a final search of documents , which had yielded what he said was a number of additional documents some lawmakers seemed unwilling to accept mr freeh s apologies and proposed remedies for change representative david r obey , democrat of wisconsin , who has served in the house since 1969 , said , i find it incredibly frustrating that year after year the agency which is supposed to be the quintessential example of excellence in law enforcement winds up being an example of mr foulup mr freeh said some fbi offices had misinterpreted the instructions to send in all documents or had misunderstood that prosecutors had agreed to an unusual arrangement in which they were obligated to turn over to the defense team almost every investigative report , covering many more documents than is customary in criminal prosecutions mr freeh said the events that led to the discovery of the missing documents began in february 2000 recognizing the historical significance of the case , mr freeh said , agents in oklahoma city began collecting all records from the case for archival preservation on dec 20 , the fbi s archivist sent a communication to all bureau offices outlining procedures for storing investigative records mr freeh said the archivist turned up only a single envelope that had not been previously accounted for even so , mr freeh said , on jan 30 , the fbi office in oklahoma city issued another communication directing that everything remaining anywhere in the file , no matter what it was , be sent to oklahoma city so it could be evaluated more than 100 boxes of material were sent in the documents were reviewed by a group of agency analysts who compared the material with reports already logged into data bases in oklahoma city by early march , mr freeh said , an analyst had collected a number of documents that she could not find in any of the databases used in the case after several weeks of further research , daniel defenbaugh , the former lead agent in the bombing case who is now head of the fbi office in dallas , ordered another canvas of all fbi offices mr defenbaugh received a final set of belatedly found documents on may 7 and one day later sent the materials to federal prosecutors in denver the papers were sent to defense lawyers on may 9 , mr freeh said , adding that he learned of them on may 10 one day later , on friday , mr ashcroft ordered the delay in mr mcveigh s execution
owings mills , md , july 26 brian billick was talking about his baltimore ravens but the description could have fit brian billick i do n't think people knew how to take us last year , billick said yesterday in his office at the ravens' complex he was talking about his super bowl xxxv champion team , the one with the diamond defense and the dillydallying offense there was no national sense of us except for ray lewis , billick said we were n't on national tv leading up to the playoffs the recent super bowl champions had all won with offense , and here we were the exact opposite two seasons ago , i heard a lot of people talking about the rams having a great chance to repeat i do n't hear a lot of talk like that about us oh , but there is talk and billick is giving everyone more to talk about when the ravens open camp on monday and begin defense of their super bowl title , hbo sports and nfl films will be there to track their every move it is training camp with a new twist , a sixweek documentary preceding the team s sept 9 season opener at home against the chicago bears dynamic , bold and new , completely out of the structured , regimented box that is often the nfl so billicklike here is a 47yearold who in only his second season as a pro head coach won football s biggest prize , a man whose early nfl days were spent in the san francisco 49ers' public relations department here is an intelligent man , an opinionated one , a confident , wellspoken , blunt , challenging and creative man an egotistical , overbearing , too talkative , too effusive man , some of his peers say will you shut up now , brian , please \? show some more humility , please \? come down off the mountain and walk with the nfl common folk , please \? there has never been another coach or anyone in the nfl who has ever said that to my face , billick said you know , i'm the same guy i was in my first season here when we went 88 , but people do n't have a problem with you when they are kicking your tail i 've spent nearly 25 years in this business , but sometimes i feel like the 40plusyearold lounge lizard who finally has a hit i 've coached division i , naia , sat in the background , sat in houses recruiting , lined the fields before games , laid the sod , knocked on doors for the school to raise money to buy vcr s i 've paid my dues in a lot of ways as a coach billick paused his eyes grew wider , softer you can eat yourself up with that because we all seek peer approval , he said but when i get mail and it s not signed , i do n't read it and when i hear stuff like that , why should i care about it if people will be cowardly and gutless enough to say those kind of things , but not to my face \? there are a lot of differences with coaches in this league but all of us share the traits of being good teachers , of being well organized and of having a passion for the game but none of them do their jobs quite like billick none were faced with baltimore s set of circumstances last year , a season on the brink well before it began because of the lewis saga and his court drama over the killing of two men that took place on the night of the previous super bowl in atlanta try leading your team out of that hole billick found a way he arrived in baltimore as an offensive whiz but then had to swallow the fact that his team was best suited to win with defense and , ego and all , he did he backed his players , he coddled them and yet pushed them , and , most of all , he earned their trust and respect it is quite a match , the ravens and billick , roadtested , tough , a team that is one of only three to win the super bowl as a wildcard entry , one that got there by winning playoff games at tennessee and at oakland , both games in which they were decided underdogs a team that whipped the giants , 347 , to win the lombardi trophy a coach who is cozy in front of a camera or a microphone or under bright lights a coach who is one of only 19 to win a super bowl little wonder he infuriates so many , especially his coaching brethren with billick , there is plenty to envy even before he opens his mouth his team is poised for an encore the new quarterback \( elvis grbac \) is better the new offensive line \( with tackle leon searcy \) is improved the recordshattering defense remains solid a supportive owner \( art modell \) , a deft general manager \( ozzie newsome \) and a sly defensive coordinator \( marvin lewis \) all return and the schedule \( chicago , plus two games apiece versus cincinnati and cleveland \) is friendly billick is refreshed he spent the offseason helping tinker with the ravens lineup , speaking to corporations and at the league s rookie symposium , finishing his book on leadership principles , visiting potential colleges for his daughter and spending some time on the delaware shore then there was a 22hour drive , each way , with his family to a small minnesota town close to the canadian border where lakes abound you could go a couple of days to our cabin there without seeing a soul , billick said , and there were some nice naps there on the hammock now the grind begins i'm not even sure what to expect with hbo , but i decided to do it because i want our players to understand from the start what it s going to be like to defend this title with the increased pressure and with the world watching now , billick said they have tasted the fruits , they 've bridged the gap between the old colts and the ravens in baltimore and now it s time to move on i'm never going to apologize for who i am i'm confident , i have my way of dealing with the media and i do n't look for fights , but i do understand that an unchallenged lie is mistaken for truth laying low or ducking and hiding \? that s not my profile nor his team s photo coach brian billick i 've paid my dues \( reuters \)
the issue is not how tall a skyscraper should be but whether it s worth the space it takes up on the ground norman foster s design for the new hearst corporation headquarters is brilliant the design is a work of architecture , not a piece of real estate it helps clarify the distinction between the two and it will reveal to disbelieving eyes that architecture is still a possibility in new york the

york city landmark plans for the new design will be filed today with the city s landmarks preservation commission the design is also subject to an approval process that will postpone the start of construction until 2003 hearst officials declined to estimate the cost lord foster , who was awarded the pritzker prize for architecture in 1999 , designed the great court of the british museum and the reconstruction of the reichstag in berlin as the new home of the german parliament originally called the international magazine building , the present sixstory headquarters was designed by joseph urban and george post it is a peculiar pastiche as envisioned by hearst , it was intended as a hinge between the broadway theater district and a new cultural center , anchored by the metropolitan opera house , then planned for columbus circle urban , himself a hybrid of architect and stage designer , should have been an ideal choice to bridge the two areas the result , however , was leaden

that has influenced the modern manhattan skyline more than any other joseph paxton s crystal palace coincidentally , paxton s temporary structure was completed 150 years ago originally erected in hyde park in london for what would turn out to be the first world s fair , the crystal palace introduced the largescale use of metal and glass prefabricated construction the public loved it architects and critics , however , refused to recognize the crystal palace as architecture at all paxton was not an architect , his method was based on greenhouse design , and critical opinion insisted on a distinction between engineering , like bridges and train sheds , and architecture , then based on the manipulation of period styles in due course 20thcentury architects sided with the victorian public in recognizing the aesthetic properties of metal and glass construction the modern office tower was born lord foster s design recapitulates that birth mother here is urban s host building baby is huge in elevation the design breaks down into four segments the bottom two floors of the urban building the base of the base will retain its existing program main entrance and lobby on eighth avenue , shops along the street , subway connection in one corner from here escalators will rise to a new main lobby at the thirdfloor level the lobby , a columnfree space , with ceilings that rise from 40 to 70 feet , has been conceived as a town square it is enclosed on three sides by buildings formed from the upper floors of the existing building these have been surgically reduced , retaining only the windowstudded facades a solid glass clerestory surmounts the masonry facades the tower is inserted into the base like a glass square peg in a solid square hole through the clerestory , pedestrians can see the bottom floor of the tower and the vshaped columns that support it the town square lobby inhabits the space beneath the bottom floor the handling of this juncture is the key to the design the tower is supported by a perimeter diagrad system of steel triangular frames that form a structural tube stainless steel clads the exterior of the tube four office floors are supported by each frame the triangular shape creates facets along the corners of the tower in changing light , sparkle , shade and reflections will play across the entire shaft none of that phonybaloney skyscrapercrown stuff here , thank you instead , the building tapers at the top , in accord with the structural system , forming an organic pinnacle since the service space here does require coverage , the rooftop will capture sunlight at night artificial lighting will intensify the beacon effect now just what is it that makes architecture so different , so appealing \? integrity , we used to call it way back when meaning in architecture , there should be a conceptual relationship between the parts and the whole as in other foster projects , the relationship here is relatively easy to grasp it revolves around the correspondence between structure and form , the concept that 20thcentury modernists picked up from paxton and turned into an urban tradition many architects have felt restrained by that tradition in the 1960 s robert venturi s conception of the building as a decorated shed came as a liberation to one and all if only more architects had known what to do with that freedom , this would be a wonderful town and i do not mean to suggest that the modern idea of integrity was upheld either consistently or to noble purpose in the years when it ruled design often it was violated to great effect eero saarinen s twa terminal at kennedy international airport , for example , was denounced by purists because the smooth concrete surfaces of the roof belied the vast amount of steel it took to hold it up nonetheless the building s integrity was manifested in the relationship of its forms and spaces , its interior and exterior , and in the procession through its threedimensional imagery the possibilities for integrity are limited only by the mind s capacity to hold unity and complexity together that is the capacity that distinguishes architecture from real estate if only more architects had it , my life would be a joy on the other hand they might be unemployed real estate , of the genre that s likely to multiply in lower manhattan , represents a substantial investment against integrity it operates by dividing the whole into disconnected parts i hesitate to declare lord foster s design a recall to order we 're going to hear all too many recalls to order in the security state years ahead but a recall to integrity of all stripes , that i can salute photos above , norman foster s design for the new hearst corporation headquarters would top a base built in 1928 with a tower indebted to the crystal palace , inset , of 1851 \( foster partners \) \( culver photos \)

tora bora , afghanistan , dec 9 commander hajji muhammad zaman , his automatic pistol in a shoulder holster , climbed a rickety ladder of logs to the roof of his mudwalled headquarters at midday today and grimly surveyed the array of dark ridgelines climbing to snowcapped peaks spread before him it is very difficult , he said scattered among those ridges are 30 or 40 fortified caves that are the last bastion of osama bin laden s hardcore supporters and perhaps the hideout of the terrorist mastermind himself the final focus of america s war in afghanistan a gray cloud suddenly appeared over one of the higher ridges , followed moments later by a boom carpet bombing by an american b52 , the white contrails stark in a blue sky a p3 orion reconnaissance plane flew lower , and f14 tomcat fighters were in the area afghan mujahedeen troops , carrying ak47 assault rifles and grenade launchers , lounged around the headquarters but in stark contrast to upbeat reports from commanders in kabul and washington , it is clear on the ground here that the siege of tora bora is stalled instead of combing the mountains in search of mr bin laden , as one report from kabul had it , the mujahedeen here are mostly squatting on their haunches it is not a simple operation , said commander zaman , who is in charge of the jalalabad fighters the united states has bombed all over afghanistan , they have bombed tora bora more than any other part of the country but this place is very safe and the caves are well protected from bombing thus far the war here has been remarkably successful , with a combination of heavy american bombing , a proxy afghan army and the shifting allegiances of warlords but tora bora may be different the mountain caves here have long been the refuge of afghan fighters fortified with the help of the central intelligence agency in the 1980 s , they withstood soviet attacks , and they have been further strengthened , people here say , over the last five years by mr bin laden s arab fighters the roughly 2 , 000 foreign fighters in the mountains have little incentive to surrender unable to switch like afghans , they could be killed if captured and , while the mujahedeen are hardened , experienced fighters , their strength lies in the guerrilla skills of ambush and raids , not a conventional frontal assault on dugin positions in their uphill bunkers , al qaeda forces have the advantage of terrain early last week , the pashtun tribal forces of the eastern shura , which took over the jalalabad area from the taliban , began assembling a force of roughly 2 , 500 fighters but in the last few days their forays up into the ridges have been driven back by barrages of mortar rounds indeed , today , the mujahedeen would not permit a journalist to go forward about two miles to what had been a command position on friday , saying it was too dangerous al qaeda has wellplaced mortar positions with large fields of fire , commander zaman said they control their area right now as to mr bin laden , the prime object of the american hunt , commander zaman asserted , i am sure 100 percent he is here there have been several reports of recent sightings of mr bin laden including one that said he was on horseback although none could be independently confirmed but the mountain caves are said to contain caverns that form virtual tunnels that could allow the elusive terrorist to escape into the wild , lawless frontier provinces of pakistan where that government s writ runs small , if at all the cave complex , with its extensive fortifications , and the passageways were described the other day by a group of mujahedeen fighters who had fought in or worked on the construction of the caves in the war against the soviets you could go to pakistan by walking , not by car , said a doctor named hamid , who had helped build the refuge , as other fighters nodded their assent you do not have to go over the mountaintop the mujahedeen were gathered in the jalalabad house of a local commander , ghulam murtaza , who is loyal to hazarat ali , security chief of the eastern shura they recounted how the cave network had been vastly improved with mr bin laden s wealth since the war against the soviets ended at the time of the british aggression there were 19 caves , commander murtaza said , suggesting that the mountain redoubts had been hideouts for afghan fighters since the 19th century twenty years ago , a local commander , engineer mahmoud , expanded the network into about 30 caves during the war against the soviets , mr bin laden s construction brigades were active in this area building camps for the mujahedeen , as was the cia there are some caves where there can be up to 30 trucks , big trucks , said muhammad ahgul , a fighter who had been in the caves during the war against the soviets in one cave there was enough ammunition for three years it was a big depot for the mujahedeen but in the last few years , the mujahedeen said , the arab fighters loyal to mr bin laden have expanded the complex considerably , building new fortifications and housing with bricks and reinforced concrete during the jihad we did not have the means to do this , commander murtaza said the activities of the arabs are very modern , and also they have great wealth there are extensive supplies , ammunition and electric generators and , they said , al qaeda forces had recently brought in six truckloads of food and other supplies mujahedeen at the front have said for several days that some of the arabs have their families with them in the caves there is water from springs above the caves , the fighters said the caves could be supplied from pakistan , they added , which had been going on until quite recently it is not destroyable by bombs , said mr aghul , describing the cave fortifications you can destroy it only from inside from outside it is impossible commander zaman agreed with this assessment , saying their location is very difficult , deep in the mountains our attack will come not very soon he dismissed the northern alliance s optimistic pronouncements the northern alliance is talking from kabul we are sitting here the difficulties were emphasized again on saturday night when commander zaman slipped a detachment up the slope to set up a machine gun nest on a small peak overlooking al qaeda forces in a valley they had just called in by radio when the american bombs fell , killing three of his own men i do n't want to blame them too much , he said of the americans today every war has its mistakes photo eastern shura fighters watched yesterday as united states b52 s carpetbombed an area of tora bora \( stephen crowley the new york times \)
there are fewer professional sports executives these days who treat their jobs as a calling , the end result of a life s passion instead of a career decision members of the old guard make their points with stories that end with a punch line or an epigrammatic quotation they seem at home regaling friends in a hotel lobby , conversations punctuated with throaty laughter and the recitation of the starting lineup of some team whose championship banner is a halfcentury old their lives seem interconnected with incalculable twists and turns that give their backgrounds color and charm the great majority have been winners , or none of their stories , quotations or life tales would be entertained at all at 59 years old , giants general manager ernie accorsi is hardly from another era he would say , as a devout sports historian , that he has absorbed the lessons of those who preceded him and when it comes to recent sports history , accorsi , a primary figure in the molding of the super bowlbound giants , has had a knack for making memories a friend of mine told me , 'nothing is ever conventional with you , ' accorsi said last week and i wonder sometimes for example \? as the general manager of the baltimore colts in 1983 , accorsi drafted john elway with the national football league s first pick even though elway had promised to never play for the colts i figured any franchise good enough for johnny unitas was good enough for john elway , accorsi said and if we had been patient , elway would have signed and saved the franchise for baltimore but without consulting accorsi , the colts' owner , robert irsay , traded elway s rights to denver accorsi eventually quit , seven weeks before irsay moved the franchise to indianapolis i knew they were going to move and i was not going to be a part of that , accorsi said a year later , as general manager of the cleveland browns , he drafted quarterback bernie kosar , selecting him several months before anyone else in the league realized kosar was eligible to be drafted accorsi had discovered an entirely legitimate , if little understood , loophole in the supplemental draft guidelines kosar would lead the browns to three american football conference championship games , where he and accorsi lost to you guessed it elway s denver broncos of course , those browns would become today s baltimore ravens , who play accorsi s giants next sunday in super bowl xxxv it is remarkable , i admit , accorsi said more remarkable is that a man of such simple habits a divorced father of three who lives alone in manhattan and who spends most days in his office and most nights at home watching televised sports could have so many unforgettable plot twists in his professional life another example twenty years ago , when accorsi was baltimore s assistant general manager , he fielded a call from a movie producer who wanted some colts jerseys for a film that was set in baltimore the movie was diner , and it included a scene where a bridetobe is interrogated with laughably difficult trivia questions about the colts she must pass the exam for the wedding to go on as scheduled guess who ended up writing the questions in what is probably the most famous scene in the movie \? the whole project had been changed several times , and in the course of this , they give me the script , accorsi said last week in his giants stadium office well , it was preposterously easy it had questions like , 'name the team colors' i told them the test would n't have any credibility , especially in the state of maryland so i rewrote the questions a sampling of the new questions what were the team s original colors \? \( green and gray \) how much did the colts spend on the phone call to pittsburgh to negotiate the signing of unitas \? \( 145 \) they were tough , accorsi said , grinning i did have a feeling that if it had been legitimate and not the movies , she would n't have passed accorsi grew up in hershey , pa , and learned a love of sports from his father , who preached the gospel of baseball and the yankees the two would talk sports for hours while driving around central pennsylvania delivering beer in ernie sr s truck at night , accorsi , an only child , tuned in any sport he could get on the radio it is a habit that has died hard stop by accorsi s summer training camp office and he is liable to be listening to some game from chicago over the internet he went to wake forest and upon his graduation in 1963 , with dreams of being a sports executive , he became a sportswriter there was some precedent to this path in those days commissioner pete rozelle of the nfl and commissioner walter kennedy of the national basketball association had been sportswriters but first , accorsi stumbled into another oddity in 1963 , working for the charlotte news , he wrote what is considered the only published account of the life of archie moonlight graham , who played for a championship minor league team in charlotte in 1902 graham , 86 years old when accorsi interviewed him , became better known a quartercentury later in the movie field of dreams graham , whose character was played by burt lancaster , had made his one , and only , major league plate appearance for the 1905 new york giants , a walk

london the opening night of cloudstreet in sydney in january 1998 is already part of australian folklore if anyone had suggested at the end of the first act that justin monjo and nick enright s fivehour adaptation of tim winton s novel would triumph in melbourne , zurich , dublin , the london fringe and at the royal national theater in london , he would have been clapped into a straitjacket if anyone had forecast that neil armfield s production would land at the brooklyn academy of music , where it opens at the harvey theater on tuesday , the kickoff event of bam s monthlong next wave down under festival of australian arts , he would have been shoved into a padded cell at that point , the play s creators were in near despair rehearsals had been a rushed six weeks there had been just one preview , a stopgo affair in which almost everything went wrong and company b belvoir of sydney had decided that so epic a piece should be staged not in its usual theater but in a vast container shed at the city s harbor rain on the metal roof meant that the first scenes were inaudible the heat rose toward a stifling 100 degrees an exhausted , frightened cast battled gamely on the only question seemed to be whether the audience would be bewildered , bored or boiled to death mr armfield , the artistic director of company b , was more and more convinced that he was leading his troupe toward disaster then mr monjo did something highly eccentric but undeniably in the spirit of a novel that introduces magic effects into its tale of two very different families sharing a rambling old house in the 1940 s and 50 s he decided to see if he could lure the shifty shadow the book s term for luck or chance out of the ad hoc theater and give it other work to do he went backstage and asked max cullen , who was playing a gambleholic , to give him a number twentythree was the reply mr monjo then drove to a nearby casino and put 10 on that number 30 times , losing to the roulette wheel on every turn and the worse things went for him , the better they went back at cloudstreet the rain stopped , the actors grew in confidence as mr armfield recalled in an interview at the royal national theater during the company s recent visit here something clicked in act ii the show began to breathe and the third act was fantastic suddenly there was a threeway connection , the energy going from actor to actor , and actor to audience , and back in a continuing circle there are less spooky explanations for the success of the play mr winton s 1991 novel is increasingly recognized as a major australian work mr armfield sees the house at no 1 cloud street , perth , as a metaphor for the nation itself , occupied as it is by the wild , shiftless pickles family , the industrious , godfearing lambs and the ghosts of an aboriginal girl and the cruel missionary who drove her to suicide but when he read the book after its publication , he was also moved by the warmth and generosity of its human observation so much so that when he finished it he burst into tears , oblivious to the fact that he was on a plane from adelaide to sydney at the time , mr armfield was searching for a distinctively australian counterpart to the royal shakespeare company s adaptation of dickens s nicholas nickleby , which he had seen respectfully cloned by another sydney company but it did n't occur to him that the answer might be cloudstreet , a book he thought more suited to the screen than the stage enter mr monjo , who had formed a small theater group , put on his own version of another winton novel , that eye , the sky , and acquired the rights to cloudstreet but the book s story was too large and expensive for his company to stage , so he took the project to company b ,

house , he saw a play that would address ideas of great import in australia a nation designated by its 18thcentury colonists as terra nullius , land of nobody , meaning that its aboriginal inhabitants could be treated as if their culture and even their lives did not exist this is a subject on which mr armfield , an earnest man who chooses his words with professorial caution , becomes especially emphatic part of the problem of being a european in australia in the last 200 years has been not knowing who or what we are , he said there s been a feeling of insecurity and an unacknowledged guilt

with marine task force 58 , in southern afghanistan , dec 14 just outside the whitewalled military compound that american marines seized here 20 days ago , engineers have fashioned a prison camp out of the desert sand surrounded by 10foot berms are three long , exposed holding pens , ringed by coils of concertina wire and visible only from a looming guard tower they are designed to hold 20 to 30 prisoners and to expand quickly should the need arise until today , the marines' desert compound had only one inmate john walker lindh , the american who joined the taliban s ranks as an islamic warrior and who had been held in isolation inside a shipping container at this base in the kandahar region mr walker , who uses his mother s name , was transferred today to the aircraft carrier peleliu in the arabian sea , pentagon officials said the bush administration has not decided whether to treat him as a military prisoner of war or to bring charges of treason or terrorism but in the meantime , the collapse of the taliban and the capture of al qaeda fighters and the growing prospects of an intelligence bonanza from interrogations of them has prompted an abrupt reversal of american policy that is evident in the prison camp that has emerged from the desert here just two weeks ago , secretary of defense donald h rumsfeld dismissed the idea of detaining large numbers of taliban or al qaeda prisoners , beyond top leaders like mullah muhammad omar and osama bin laden but this week , he announced that american forces in afghanistan would very likely take a sizable number of prisoners into custody they are to be imprisoned at bases here in afghanistan , like the marine encampment or the airport at kandahar , which the marines have now taken over , or aboard navy ships in the arabian sea , gen tommy r franks , the commander of american forces in the region , said today he said that about 50 al qaeda prisoners had been taken in the intense fighting around tora bora today but are still in the hands of opposition commanders in the area united states commandos and intelligence operatives are supporting afghan fighters in that battle but in the kandahar area , there have been no reports of major firefights or the seizure of any prisoners in recent days opposition forces have captured only two or three taliban leaders , including its army chief of staff several of mr bin laden s lieutenants have been killed , but so far none have been taken prisoner other enemy fighters are hospitalized many prisoners could ultimately be tried by the fledgling government that takes control in kabul on dec 22 foreign fighters , especially those belonging to al qaeda s ranks , could be extradited to their countries of origin , if those nations assured the united states that they would face stiff punishment although human rights groups have warned that they should not be sent to countries that might abuse them the pentagon s general counsel , william j haynes ii , has been working with justice department officials to establish legal guidelines on how american forces and authorities will deal with these various groups of battlefield captives it is increasingly clear that american forces here will use considerable discretion to capture higher ranking taliban and al qaeda fighters and prosecute them , perhaps before the military tribunals that president bush has authorized mr rumsfeld said that american special forces troops and intelligence officers had already begun questioning prisoners in the custody of antitaliban forces he suggested the interrogations were revealing new details about how mr bin laden s al qaeda network operated inside afghanistan there are interrogations taking place , there s documentation being found and discovered and analyzed and translated , so that each day we learn more and know more as more address books are found and phone books are found and computer hard drives are found , he said as people have left areas , clearly our knowledge base is going up the actual number of prisoners now held by antitaliban forces remains something of a mystery the international committee for the red cross says it has visited about 700 prisoners at 15 various sites but concedes that this number is a fraction of the real total the number of prisoners is impossible to estimate , said michael kleiner , a spokesman for the committee s office in kabul without a government in place it is impossible to know where people are being detained an additional concern within the pentagon is that taliban or al qaeda troops will be able to buy their way to freedom before american officials are able to interrogate them one senior military official said today that he had received reports that as many as 300 captured qaeda troops may have escaped detention in the tora bora region by bribing their guards the marines' base here , known as camp rhino , is an ideal place because of its remote location and unlimited space for new holding pens it is a mission , however , that several officers here said they did not particularly relish , in part because of the drain on the marines' sparse logistics but a senior military official said today that the pentagon was considering sending light army forces , possibly from the 101st airborne division , to provide security at camp rhino if it is still needed several weeks from now although pentagon officials have stopped short of considering mr walker or other possible captives prisoners of war , preferring for legal reasons to call them detainees a marine spokesman here , capt stewart t upton , said that mr walker was being afforded all the protections given to prisoners under the geneva conventions mr walker was held in a freight container , receiving water and portions of the same military rations that troops here eat he has undergone medical treatment for wounds received in the prison uprising in mazarisharif that led to his capture his condition is said to be improving
albany , aug 7 a plan to open prekindergarten classes in thousands of schools this year is dead housing construction for homeless people will sputter the same could happen to day care programs for tens of thousands of poor children groups that help people with aids take their medications stand to see their budgets evaporate so do those that build housing for the homeless thousands possibly hundreds of thousands of homeowners will get property tax increases all of these effects , and many more , are likely to come to pass if the 80 billion , strippeddown budget enacted last week is the only budget the state gets for the fiscal year that began april 1 if the legislature and gov george e pataki can agree on a supplemental budget , a cloudy prospect at best , some of the harm to programs can be averted , but in other places , the damage is done until next year the situation for us is completely devastating , said brad williams , executive director of the new york independent living council , an alliance of organizations that help disabled people i have no idea how we 're going to survive the democratled assembly and the republicanled senate , frustrated by mr pataki s refusal to negotiate , agreed last week to a barebones budget that leaves out programs they all care deeply about they hope the resulting pain is so acute that interest groups from hospital administrators to welfare mothers will pressure mr pataki to bargain with them on a multibilliondollar supplemental budget it is a risky strategy , and many legislators are afraid that it could backfire , leaving the budget cuts in place a prominent democratic lawmaker described their approach to the governor this way we 're cutting ourselves and bleeding all over him so far , it does not appear to be working the governor has spent the past several days barnstorming the state , holding two or three news conferences a day to accuse legislative leaders of being irresponsible and hoping that they , not he , will be blamed for groups that provide services to the poor through state grants , the mechanics of spending make the cuts even deeper than they appear at first often , money is included in the budget but not spent until the next year the spending then must be authorized a second time , a reappropriation but to turn up the heat on the governor , the legislature has cut off all reappropriations , totaling billions of dollars , effective sept 15 the governor s budget proposed leaving out social service programs or cuts in their funding , knowing that lawmakers would later restore the money but the legislature refused to make those additions in the barebones budget , leaving programs at the governor s lower levels that spells disaster for programs like the state s homeless housing assistance program , which gives money to nonprofit groups to build or renovate housing last year s budget allocated 30 million for the program , but none of that money was to be delivered until october all of it is a reappropriation and , barring a new budget deal , all of it will evaporate in addition , the program stands to lose its customary 10 million addition from the legislature , money that would be spent next year we could be denied all of last year s money and onethird of this year s , said jennifer flynn , executive director of new york city aids housing network , a coalition of groups that apply for the money waiting lists for housing would get longer , our member groups would lay people off , services at existing housing would be cut back people need to understand , this is a crisis the centers for the disabled that mr williams represents stand to lose a 105 million reappropriation , most of their budget for the year , plus a 1 million legislative addition for next year hundreds of social service groups tell similar stories some nonprofits are in worse straits because their budgets rely on additions by the assembly the fortune society , which runs a variety of social service programs and helps former convicts stay out of trouble , faces a 725 , 000 shortfall for programs to counsel parents of troubled youths , to steer convicts into drug treatment rather than prison , and to help single fathers find jobs and pay child support the legal aid society will lose 8 million to represent poor women in domestic violence cases , elderly people who lose social security benefits , and people fighting evictions prisoners' legal services , which files lawsuits for inmates , faces elimination of its 35 million budget for the biggest area of dispute , aid to schools , the impasse has already had an irreversible effect education officials say that even with more spending , it is too late to hire new teachers or find classroom space this year , several hundred districts were to become eligible , for the first time , for a state program that pays for prekindergarten classes for 4yearolds and reduced elementary class sizes but mr pataki left more than 200 million for that effort out of his proposed budget , and the legislature did not restore it legislators and school officials concede that , with the start of school a month away , there will be no expansion of the program overall , the governor proposed a 382 million increase in state aid to schools , just enough to keep up with inflation the senate wanted 900 million , the assembly 17 billion by law , most districts must draft their budgets in may , forcing them to guess how much state aid they would receive in its barebones budget , the legislature accepted mr pataki s figure , leaving districts with far less aid than they expected most districts send out property tax bills in mid or late august education officials say that many districts will raise taxes to make up for the difference new york city schools and some other cities do not levy their taxes , so they must either find other ways of making up the money or simply do without the deepest cuts were at a favorite agency of the governor s , the empire state development corporation , which offers grants and loans for business development its operating budget was reduced from 243 million to 4 , 100 , and its 221 million carried over from previous years was eliminated the pataki administration is hunting for ways to keep the agency running and pay its staff the state s hospitals and nursing homes , which face a difficult round of labor negotiations , are also affected the budget guarantees that medicaid payments to them will fall about 500 million short it also fails to allocate about 250 million in federal aid to enroll medicaid recipients in managed care plans we are going to have a real crisis , said jennifer cunningham , executive director of the service employees international union , new york state council , which represents health care workers this is n't just the frills this is the meat and potatoes of financing the health care industry
washington , jan 5 defense secretary william s cohen plans to order a new review to determine whether military commanders in the persian gulf should be held accountable for any security lapses that contributed to the bombing of the destroyer cole in yemen last october , pentagon officials said today the review raises the possibility that any punishment resulting from the attack could include highranking commanders in the persian gulf region one official said it would be led by the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff , gen henry h shelton mr cohen s decision came after a defense department commission concluded that there were significant security shortcomings in the region before a skiff packed with explosives attacked the cole as it stopped to refuel in the yemeni port of aden on oct 12 , killing 17 sailors and wounding 39 others that commission led by two retired commanders , adm harold w gehman of the navy and gen william w crouch of the army avoided assigning blame , focusing instead on improving security for american forces in the region but its findings , which the pentagon plans to make public next week , have raised enough questions to merit a review of the actions of commanders who oversee military operations in the persian gulf region , the officials said in a separate navy inquiry that focused narrowly on actions about the cole , an investigator concluded last month that the destroyer s captain and crew failed to follow a series of strict security procedures on the day it stopped in yemen to refuel the finding raises the prospect of disciplinary action against the cole s captain , cmdr kirk s lippold , and others aboard the destroyer a final report of that inquiry today reached adm vern clark , who as chief of naval operations is the navy s senior officer navy officials emphasized that admiral clark , like other commanders below him , had the authority to revise any findings of fault before the investigation was considered complete mr cohen s decision to order a new accountability review may address some navy officials' concerns by reviewing whether lapses beyond the actions of the cole s crew might have left the destroyer vulnerable the officials declined to identify any officers whose actions would be the focus of the new inquiry , saying it would be wrong to prejudge the review but the report of the commission led by admiral gehman and general crouch , which is being put into final form this weekend , has raised questions about whether officers in the united states central command did enough to share intelligence reports with the cole s officers , even if none were specific enough to warrant calling off the cole s refueling stop in yemen on the day of the attack there was sufficient intelligence that should have prompted warnings , one defense department official said , summarizing the commission s findings ever since the cole attack , the pentagon has been under intense pressure , particularly from lawmakers on capitol hill , to get to the bottom of whether anything could have been done to avert the bombing , which tore a ragged 40footby40foot hole in the destroyer s port side but the new inquiry , like the navy s , may conclude that there was little , short of avoiding refueling in yemen , that would have prevented what was clearly a meticulously planned suicide bombing while the report of the commission led by admiral gehman and general crouch identifies problems with protecting american forces in the region , it will not attribute the cole bombing to any one lapse , the officials said for that reason , it could be difficult for a new review to ascribe blame to individual commanders mr cohen s decision to order a new review will effectively leave any findings of fault to presidentelect george w bush s choice as the next defense secretary , donald h rumsfeld
cody , wyo , july 26 as the sun set behind this cowboy town in northwest wyoming on wednesday , a stream of motor homes pulled into the parking lot for the night , many of them on their way to or from yellowstone national park , about 50 miles to the west but their overnight stay was not at any traditional campground , the ponderosa on one side of town , the absaroka bay on the other or even the koa campground of cody , one of the first campgrounds for motor homes in the west , now 40 years old no , home for these elaborate vehicles , some costing 150 , 000 and more , was cody s new walmart , and the reason was simple unlike the campgrounds , which charge as much as 3695 a night for motor homes , the walmart lot is free we 've stayed at lots of walmarts , said norma tennenbaum of new city , ny , who has been traveling almost nonstop for the last five years with her husband , avrum , a retired assistant school principal in the bronx , in their 37foot fleetwood discovery it s nice , and it s safe in a survey last year , editors of the web site freecampgroundscom , asked readers how many times in 1999 did you stay overnight at a walmart \? the site found that a third of the 227 respondents had stayed at least one night and about a quarter had stayed at three or more music to walmart s ears for several years now , the stores have been welcoming travelers to their spacious lots , bringing a new definition to stop and shop while they provide none of the electrical and cable television hookups available at campgrounds , the stores offer onestop shopping for food and supplies but not everybody in cody is so thrilled to see as many as three dozen motor homes a night lined up outside the walmart a few people have expressed annoyance that the inhabitants avoid paying lodging costs , which carry the 4 percent state sales tax and the 4 percent county lodging tax laurie kadrich , the city administrator , estimated that annual taxes generated by visitors to the area produce as much as 1 million for park county , which includes about a quarter of yellowstone national park s 7 , 000 square miles cody s share is perhaps 75 , 000 , and without walmart s hospitality , the figures could be higher it s cheating , in the view of some , ms kadrich said tom bullock , owner of the absaroka bay campground , said obviously , it has impacted us some thirty vehicles a night in a small town has to affect somebody but my issue is whether walmart is being a good neighbor i have to collect the lodging tax they do n't so taxes are missing to the state hold on there , said some of the walmart lot residents who had collected around the restored 1946 chevrolet pickup truck that ken symonds of jensen beach , fla , hooks to the back of the 40foot beaver grand marquis that carries him and his wife , joan , around the country that is a false and unfair accusation , they said , given the cash they drop wherever they stop i do n't think we 've cheated the town out of anything , except maybe the campground owners , mr symonds said what we spent in walmart provides much more in taxes than if we stayed a night at a campground mr symonds figured he and his wife had already spent 300 in cody , most of it in the walmart and as mrs tennenbaum said , if we had to pay overnight fees , maybe we 'd eat in instead of going out besides , who wants to pay taxes if they can be avoided i'm a little bit tired of paying taxes , said sgt gene plambeck of the cody police department , who drove by for a better look at mr symonds s chevy the symonds are just the kind of people walmart officials had in mind when they began encouraging travelers to spend the night highmaintenance vehicles like the symonds s , equipped with a satellite dish , bathtub , tiled floors , convection oven and beveled mirrors , always need supplies and upkeep and the whole idea of a big walmart in cities like cody is that the store tries to stock anything anyone can think of oh , and the symonds have one other thing in their home , a special randmcnally road atlas with a listing of walmarts where vehicles like theirs are welcome always thinking , those walmart people tom williams , a company spokesman , said policy was to welcome recreational vehicle owners wherever local ordinances permitted why \? rv owners are very good customers , mr williams said so far , cody has no prohibition against parking the vehicles at store lots but ms kadrich said the city recently asked walmart to discourage travelers from pulling in otherwise , she said , the city might pass an ordinance against it why do something for one business that we do n't do for others , she said it just does n't seem right photo at the walmart parking lot in cody , wyo , motor homes have begun to park for the night unlike local campgrounds , the lot is free it s nice , and it s safe , said norma tennenbaum of new city , ny \( rob densmore for the new york times \)

one prefers the latenight pulse of city life , the other the lightsout peace of the suburbs one is a mets fan , the other is devoted to the yankees one ca n't stand caviar , the other abhors clams but both share a passion for barbecue , jack daniels and theater and , individually and together , the brothers viertel have carved out a place for themselves in the new york theater world that lately has become more prominent earlier this season , jack , 52 , the creative director of jujamcyn theaters , was named the new artistic chief of the esteemed encores ! concert musical series at city center jack viertel also wrote the book for time and again , a show that opened at the manhattan theater club on jan 30 and , through jujamcyn , the third largest commercial theater owner in new york , he is helping to bring two productions to broadway this season the mel brooks musical the producers \( based on mr brooks s 1968 movie of the same name \) , which opens april 19 at the st james theater and august wilson s drama king hedley ii , which opens april 29 at the virginia theater in december , tom , a real estate executive and theatrical producer seven years jack s senior , was named board chairman of the prestigious eugene o'neill theater center in waterford , conn , which encourages new writers and composers tom viertel , whose first produced show was penn and teller in 1985 in new york , and his producing partners are also helping to mount the producers this season as well as mnemonic , a piece by simon mcburney s experimental british troupe theatre de complicite , which begins a limited commercial run on march 28 at john jay college theater on 10th avenue while the brothers have always been drawn to the footlights jack was the theater critic for the los angeles herald examiner who took tom to see penn and teller in los angeles for the first time in 1984 their new roles will almost surely allow them more influence as veterans of the commercial theater , both men will now have high profiles in the nonprofit arena , a fact that points up the increasing degree to which the once distinct worlds of commercial and nonprofit theater overlap encores ! , which has become a major guardian of america s musicaltheater heritage , seeks to resurrect old works and look at them anew while the o'neill is a prime nursery for the cultivation of untried theatrical talent yet conceivably , both organizations could become incubators for commercial productions with the viertels in positions to nudge them in that direction indeed , tom said he felt that the o'neill center had become too exclusively focused on new writers and he wanted to include established theatrical authors as well , a possible hint that the o'neill could be used to test productions with commercial appeal by creators who have track records his first appointment to the board was susan quint gallin , a commercial producer , and he said he hoped to add more such members but tom viertel noted that his principal responsibilities at the o'neill , where he has been a longtime board member , will be guiding the program , motivating the board and raising money the institution is more than 1 million in debt his new position , and that of the recently hired executive director , howard sherman , were previously held by the organization s founding executive director and chairman , george c white , who has stepped down after 36 years james houghton , the artistic director of the o'neill , said the fact that tom viertel had one foot in the commercial theater and the other in the nonprofit world was not a problem tom is , i think , extremely disciplined about walking that line , mr houghton said he has never given me any reason to be concerned about that if questions arose , tom said , i would try to think about it in as ethical a manner as i can generally , he pointed out , shows at the o'neill are too embryonic to consider for commercial purposes i certainly never thought of the o'neill as a shopping market , he said so much of what goes on there is in such an early stage that it s impossible to evaluate that way f or his part , jack has traditionally played a behindthescenes role at jujamcyn , helping to identify promising projects , putting creative teams together , offering script notes he said that he has preferred playing no 2 to more assertive types , like rocco landesman , the president of jujamcyn , and to tom , about whom he said , it s comforting to me to have him step out and do things that i do n't then have to do now , though , with the departure of kathleen marshall as the artistic director at encores ! , jack is the one on the line i'm finally in charge and i'm not at all used to it , he said it s a shock to my system for tom viertel , too , the o'neill position signifies a stepping out of sorts he adds the responsibility to his work as part of a producing team that includes his cousin steven baruch , who is in real estate with him richard frankel , the former managing director of the circle repertory company and marc routh , who started out as mr frankel s assistant tom viertel is generally regarded in the theater industry as a tough negotiator with a good business sense as with any producer , some might question his artistic judgment at times , given the mixed critical reception of several shows he has been involved in smokey joe s cafe \( widely seen in the industry as a triumph of marketing over matter \) , swing !

washington , oct 29 justice department officials said today that the number of people who had been detained in connection with the sept 11 attacks had surpassed 1 , 000 , and civil liberties advocates said the government s refusal to disclose the identities of those held and the charges against them raised the possibility of secret detentions the arrests have been shrouded in confusion and secrecy , with the justice department providing a running tally but declining , in most cases , to provide names and details justice department officials said today that they were slowly releasing information about some of the arrests but were prohibited from doing so in some cases and were not required to do so in many others mindy tucker , a justice department spokeswoman , stressed that all of those arrested had had access to lawyers she said attorney general john ashcroft was confident that all the actions of law enforcement officials in the investigation had been consistent with the law and the constitution s protections nonetheless , a coalition of civil liberties groups said today that it would file a lawsuit against the government demanding that officials identify who has been arrested , what charges have been filed against them and where they are being held while certain aspects of the fbi investigation into the terrorist attacks need to be secret , we do not live in a country where the government can keep secret who they arrest , where they are being held , or the charges against them , said kate martin , the director of the center for national security studies , one of several groups that called on the government today to give out more information the secret detention of more than 800 people over the past few weeks is frighteningly close to the practice of 'disappearing' people in latin america , she said in a statement gregory t nojeim , the legislative counsel of the american civil liberties union , said today that he and a few others from his organization met on friday with robert s mueller iii , the director of the federal bureau of investigation , to ask for more information about those arrested he said mr mueller was largely unresponsive and provided no information ms tucker , the justice department spokeswoman , said those detained fell into three categories a small number of material witnesses , about 180 people charged with immigration violations and , the largest group , those being held on federal , state or local criminal charges unrelated to the sept 11 attacks ms tucker said the number of those arrested in connection with the investigation of the terrorist attacks was now 1 , 017 most of those people are still in custody in the early days of the investigation , the justice department acknowledged that two people had been arrested on material witness warrants ms tucker said more had been held on such warrants but she would not say how many the arrest files of everyone in that category have been sealed because of a continuing grand jury investigation of those arrested on possible immigration violations , she said , all are believed to have some connection to terrorist organizations or have some information , although none have been charged with terrorist crimes ms tucker said the arrests on immigration charges for people suspected of having some involvement in terrorist activities reflected the department s new approach emphasizing prevention of terrorist acts attorney general ashcroft said last week that the department would prosecute people suspected of association with terrorist groups on whatever charges they could find in order to get them out of the country or in jail ms tucker said that before the terrorist attacks , the department had never disclosed the identities of people charged with immigration violations now , she said , the department is beginning to release details of some of the cases , though not the names of those arrested the department has released the names of some people charged with federal criminal violations , but ms tucker said some of those cases have been sealed by judges at the request of prosecutors david cole , a lawyer with the center for constitutional rights , which is part of the coalition seeking more details from officials , said today that it was possible that the government had done nothing improper but that it was impossible to tell without more information he said there were anecdotal reports of detainees unable to reach lawyers and of lawyers unable to reach their clients the most common news reports of abuse involve mistreatment of prisoners of middle eastern background at jails prosecutors in brooklyn are investigating charges that a prisoner detained in connection with the terrorist investigation had been beaten by a guard at the metropolitan detention center the prisoner , mohammed maddy , was indicted today on a variety of criminal charges , including lying to the fbi and immigration officials the fbi is also investigating a complaint that a 20yearold student from pakistan was beaten by inmates while guards stood by in a mississippi jail
mike piazza has made a career of proving people wrong , so he could always do it again piazza might really be as different as the mets say he is , as close to indestructible as a catcher has ever been piazza might continue to swat and squat until he is 40 years old there was no precedent for a 62ndround draft choice to become a ninetime allstar , so maybe he can maintain his pace of roughly 40 home runs and 1 , 100 innings behind the plate every season but , privately , the mets are not counting on it and the seemingly inevitable shift of piazza to first base whether it takes place in 2003 or 2004 will have implications on what the team does this winter after their lethargic season , the mets must act but wherever they turn , there are problems piazza is their best player , their most reliable run producer and a relative bargain at 95 million next season but his future muddles the mets' offseason picture there is no doubt the freeagent first basemen jason giambi and tino martinez would help the mets next season the mets were last in the majors in runs scored , and the only national league team with fewer home runs , the montreal expos , is on baseball s endangered list giambi or martinez would improve the team instantly signing either would force the mets to do something with todd zeile , which became harder this week when zeile essentially went against general manager steve phillips s wishes and had surgery to remove a bone spur from his right elbow the procedure might restore zeile s missing power by allowing him to extend his arms without pain , but it also makes it even harder for phillips to trade zeile and his 6 million salary and the mets have no plans to move zeile back to third base should they trade robin ventura , who will make 825 million next season but the strong likelihood of piazza s eventual move to first means that zeile will probably be the mets' first baseman again next season giambi will command a six or sevenyear deal and can play only first base a serious pursuit of him is out the mets would consider signing martinez for three years , at most , but martinez might also command a longer deal if he does , the mets would not be the team that gives it to him with a payroll that will again exceed 90 million , phillips , as a matter of policy , will at least investigate the possibility of signing any elite free agent moises alou , barry bonds and juan gonzalez are three outfielders who could have an immediate impact but the mets are leery of alou s age \( 35 \) and injury history , and they do not want to be used to drive up the price of bonds or gonzalez , players the mets believe are likely to sign elsewhere bonds , especially , will command a salary the mets might not want to take on bonds is 37 , but that will probably not keep him from getting a lavish deal of perhaps five years looking at the data , reggie jackson , frank robinson , willie mays , anyone in the 500home run club , none of those guys had their optimum years at 35 or 36 , bonds s agent , scott boras , said yesterday he s a different guy trading for a younger player might help the mets avoid a venturastyle contract , in which the player is helpful early in the deal but stops producing and becomes hard to trade later lefthanded hitting outfielders like jeromy burnitz , darin erstad , cliff floyd and brian giles could be potential fits in a trade the mets are more willing than ever to trade some players they had resisted dealing , including the lefthanded pitcher glendon rusch , outfielders benny agbayani and jay payton , and perhaps , though less likely , closer armando benitez the mets understand one thing they usually go only as far as second baseman edgardo alfonzo takes them an awful 2001 season has tarnished his reputation but , apparently , redoubled his dedication to improve it was the mets' worstkept secret last season that alfonzo was out of shape worn out from a long season and under restrictions from the mets , alfonzo retired to his farm in venezuela last winter , playing briefly in winter ball his dismal results this season a 243 average with 17 homers and 49 runs batted in can be traced to discomfort in his lower back , which was not helped by his lack of conditioning since midoctober , alfonzo , a free agent after next season , has spent four days a week in new york with a strength coach and two days a week with a personal trainer alfonzo has lost weight he wants to shed 10 pounds and will return to venezuela only for a brief visit it was n't a careerthreatening season , but it was enough of a wakeup call to him to get him on a program , said alfonzo s agent , peter greenberg it took a while to convince him to do it , and now he s convinced he s going to be in the best shape of his life and have the best season of his career as the mets enter a complicated winter , that might be the best offseason news of all photos although the mets want to trade todd zeile , left , he will probably play first in 2002 mike piazza will most likely take over at first in 2003 or 2004 \( associated press zeile gary i rothstein for the new york times piazza \)
we can all use instructions now and then , explanations of how things work , directions on how to proceed that s what maps and manuals are for , science and codes of ethics , even certain kinds of art in mid19thcentury america , the religious sect known as the shakers , or the united society of believers in christ s second coming , felt that need with some urgency living memory of the sect s magnetic founder , ann lee \( 17361784 \) , was fading fast the enddays she predicted were slow in arriving a faith fueled by charisma and crisis was losing steam and america was changing people were leaving farms for the city sexual mores were loosening up shakerism celibate , communitarian , rurally based felt the impact as younger believers opted out of a religious life to marry , have children and take their place among the world s people , as nonshakers were called something had to happen to reignite the fire , and something did suddenly , mother ann and the early shaker saints began to revisit their earthly children their presence was felt at prayer meetings sometimes they were actually seen a few community members often women , but not always received supernatural gifts to be passed on to others or to the group at large these individuals were known as instruments , and they were important figures during the era of revivalism in the 1840 s called mother ann s work often they were channels for religious songs thousands of extant shaker hymns date from this time a few received symbolic visual images , which they turned into drawings at once didactic and decorative , the drawings have no parallel in american religious history and they are among the least familiar components of shaker visual culture , which is famed for its plainstyle , nofrills domestic objects the drawings have a very different look they are elaborate , intricate , dense with detail after they stopped being produced , in the 1850 s , many were destroyed they were thought to be too sacred or too arcane for eyes other than those of their intended recipients yet some 200 examples survive , and nearly 80 of them are included in heavenly visions shaker gift drawings and gift songs at the drawing center organized by france morin , an independent curator , with the ucla hammer museum in los angeles , it has be one of the most beautiful shows in town , and one of the strangest certain drawings are famous , particularly those by hannah cohoon \( 17881864 \) , who joined the hancock shaker community at pittsfield , mass , in 1817 she is the only instrument known to have signed her work , and she had reason to be proud of it her muchreproduced tree of light , or blazing tree , with its symmetrical stemthin branches and leaves sizzling with rays of scarlet paint , is a knockout also remarkable is her shrinelike bower of mulberry trees with its classic shaker table set for a heavenly feast , of a kind the shakers ritually enacted as a gesture of communion with their spiritual forebears the food at such meals was imaginary , but the link with the past felt real cohoon recorded that the image was given to her directly by blessed mother ann ann lee s dynamic , initiating role in shakerism should never be forgotten it s what gives the religion its bite , its resistant texture , its heterodox irritation a blacksmith s daughter from manchester , england , a social visionary and a moral provocateur , she started a utopian movement that came from the heart and the gut and raised hackles whereever it went lee preached pacificism , equality of the sexes and strict celibacy she restructured the family unit , separating parents from children and husbands from wives to create a chaste new community of workers and worshippers , a kind of boot camp for the world beyond by declaring herself the embodiment of christ on earth , she assigned spiritual authority usually associated with men to a woman she insisted that the end of the world was nigh and that heaven was a hardearned , sweptclean place she rarely stopped moving hounded out of england , she sailed for the american colonies , landing in new york after finding temporary quarters in manhattan , she and a few followers went upstate and started a farm then she traveled through new england for almost two years , converting , working and worshiping she was repeatedly assaulted by rural vigilantes no wonder the shaker universe felt becalmed after she died at 48 an immensely powerful spiritual engine had been switched off mother ann s work was an attempt to switch it on again , to rekindle some of the nervy , ecstatic excitement that lee generated it makes sense that she was cited as the source of many of the gift drawings she even makes personal appearances in a few one is a richly colored image by polly collins \( 180184 \) , the child of a vermont stone carver , who became a shaker at 19 her emblem of the heavenly sphere consists of dozens of bustlength , pinkcheeked portrait heads stacked vertically in neat rows , a design similar to that found in tombstones carved by her father the portraits include biblical prophets and early shaker leaders , with ann lee in the place of honor at the upper left and the only secular figure christopher columbus in the same row the implication is that he and mother ann were equally discovers of new worlds in america

the calls came in a torrent , from white bear lake , minn , and castaic , calif , from emporia , kan , and boucherville , quebec there was even an email letter from a family in argentina all were eagerly offering to adopt a world trade center orphan for weeks after the terrorist attacks , secretaries at the new york state office of children and family services and press officers at the city s administration for children s services could hardly answer the telephone without hearing from people who had read news of the many , hundreds , even thousands of orphans left in need of a home by the sept 11 disaster the problem is , officials say , there are none not a single child who needs foster care or adoption by strangers not a single documented case of a child who lost both parents just a handful of verified cases in which children lost their only parent and all have close relatives who have taken over their care no one can overestimate the grief of losing one parent whatever the final number of casualties , as mayor rudolph w giuliani has suggested , it will be more than any of us can bear and certainly more than should be borne by their children but six weeks after sept 11 , while there is still no overall count of the bereaved children , the news media and public officials are still repeating numbers like 10 , 000 and 15 , 000 such estimates of the children left behind , always high , now appear to be seriously out of line using either the most recent estimate of the missing calculated by the new york times , just under 3 , 000 , or the official estimate , 4 , 700 , that would mean that every victim had , on average , more than two or three children under 18 since those lost include many without children or with grown children , it is increasingly hard to justify estimates like 15 , 000 , cited in an editorial in the times on sept 26 , or 10 , 000 , cited last week on national public radio by senator hillary rodham clinton yet it is these same estimates that seem to give credence to assertions that many or several hundred children have been left without any parent the common understanding of the word orphan such phrases showed up only this week in usa today and new york magazine it s pure speculation , said jennifer falk , a spokeswoman for the administration for children s services , who found herself debunking one set of urban myths and journalists' assumptions only to be hit with a new wave as the next article about children appeared i do n't know where the word orphan came from a spokesman for the twin towers orphan fund said some dictionary definitions of orphan include any person who has lost one parent but the emotional tug of the word orphan draws on the ageold image of a waif without either mother or father and all available evidence shows that a large majority of the children bereaved by the trade center attacks on sept 11 were living in twoparent families on sept 10 in current parlance , they are not orphans now , but children living in singleparent homes even the children of single mothers lost in the twin towers typically still have a father in their lives somehow , that reality has never caught up with the outpouring of public concern and the news media s appetite for the idea of the world trade center orphan from the start , there were rumors that shrugged off facts the one , for example , about the day care teacher sheltering five trade center orphans days later , she was still said to be feeding them soup , unwilling to send them to foster care a survey of child care agencies and the passage of time dispelled that myth , but another took its place this month a clutch of orphaned children of illegal immigrants had shown up secretly at the family assistance center the presumed sighting led back to a massage therapist who had seen some hispanic children in the center s day care and thought they might be orphans the evidence for what senator clinton called probably 10 , 000 children who have lost one or both parents can be equally elusive a multitude of news reports and organizations have estimated 10 , 000 to 15 , 000 children orphaned , karen dunn , the senator s press secretary , said when asked how the figure was calculated in the times s editorial , its writer said , the estimate of perhaps 15 , 000 children who lost a mother or a father was an extrapolation from an early estimate that as many as 7 , 000 adults were missing , and a report that 1 , 500 children had been left by 700 missing cantor fitzgerald employees , predominantly young married men with large families william van slyke , spokesman for the state office of children and family services , said it has kept a list of those seeking to adopt trade center orphans some , he said , might want to look instead at the 2 , 558 children in state custody whose parents lost their right to keep them
few new york novels indeed few tales of the city of any kind have enjoyed a longer or more fortunate run than time and again , jack finney s notoriously beloved and painstakingly researched novel of time travel in old new york first published in 1970 to respectful reviews and moderate sales , the book rapidly acquired the status of a minor cult classic , eventually selling more than a quarter of a million copies , and winning for its author who died in 1995 , and who was probably best known otherwise for the thricefilmed science fiction thriller invasion of the body snatchers an ardent corps of devoted admirers an elaborately \( some might say overly \) contrived hybrid of a book part science fiction , part detective story , part love story , part historical romance the novel tells the tale of an advertising artist named simon morley , who is transported back to the year 1882 as part of a topsecret governmentsponsored time travel project after staying in print for more than three decades now , the book shows no real signs of losing steam mr finney himself published a sequel to it the year before he died , called from time to time , and scarcely a year goes by without fresh rumors of a film adaptation on tuesday , a musical version , of all things , opens for a limited run in a manhattan theater club production at city center so it seems an apt moment to revisit this oddly longlived book and reflect a little on the special hold it has exerted over the imagination of many new yorkers to be sure , like many another cult classic , mr finney s entertainment , as he modestly liked to call it , does n't stand up well to close reading or sustained analysis , nor is it a novel without serious flaws longwinded , occasionally selfrighteous and as psychologically shallow as a daguerreotype , it is almost soporifically plodding for its first hundred pages its firstperson narrator and omnipresent hero , simon morley , suffers from a vaguely insufferable form of unconscious selfsatisfaction , which begins to take a toll early on the action and dialogue , when not melodramatic , are stilted and frequently forced to do double duty as exposition the attitude towards women is as subtly anachronistic and discouraging as a back issue of playboy yet none of this seemed to matter much to readers in 1970 nor to many readers today and to grasp the impact of mr finney s historical flight of fancy when it first appeared 30 years ago , it s helpful to recall the historical circumstances of its original publication history itself was at a premium 30 years ago to a degree hard to grasp by anyone under 50 today , new york in 1970 was a city more poignantly estranged from its past than at any other time in its history , before or since for more than half a century , an unrelenting ideology of the modern and the new had reigned supreme in city life , dismissing traditional forms in architecture and urban planning as obsolete and unprogressive more to the point , and more devastatingly , three decades of massive postwar urban renewal and highway building in new york had razed dozens of neighborhoods , along with thousands upon thousands of historic buildings and structures , including irreplaceable architectural treasures like the old pennsylvania station as usual in new york , the poet james merrill lamented , everything is torn down before you have had time to care for it you would think the simple fact of having lasted threatened our cities like mysterious fires mr finney s novelistic effort to go back in time and channel the past , using what fragments of the city s physical history remained a suite of rooms in the dakota , sections of central park , an old stereoscopic photograph , the upraised arm of the statue of liberty resonated powerfully in a city that for two generations had seemed intent on destroying much of where it had come from as such , it was part of a more general urban salvage program in the 1960 s and 70 s , which like the then recently established landmarks preservation commission was desperately trying to rescue new york s physical heritage , and the sense of history itself , from the oblivion of the wrecker s ball nostalgia , in such a context , seemed not so much a sentimental longing for the past as an act of reclamation and a gesture of defiance the past was not lost , permanently hid in death s dateless night , but still existed , ready for use if we only thought about it in the right way , just back around a bend in the river of time , far enough away to be strange , yet close enough to be familiar the thrill of the 1880 s to which mr finney s hero returns has less to do with the quaint differences he observes between then and now and more to do with how we can discern in that longlost decade the recognizable forms of the present just beginning to emerge from the primordial ooze here are traffic jams , and the statue of liberty in embryonic form , the still unfinished span of the brooklyn bridge , and a venerable apartment house like the dakota , or the american museum of natural history , surrounded by pastures and farmland in the end , connection to the past for mr finney s hero , and , one suspects , for many readers , is a metaphor for human connection in general great cities are perhaps above all else the way we make contact with each other , not only in space but in time perhaps the most enduring pleasure of time and again , for all its faults and longueurs , is the simple , heartfelt way it brings the past alive for readers reenfolding the present in the vital stream of time , and reanimating our sense of the world around us as a place of action , consequence , promise and potential excerpt jingling bells behind me and to the north i heard a distant rhythmical jingle , perceptibly louder each time it sounded , and i turned to look back toward the street once again for a moment or two i stood listening to the jinkjinkjingle sound , and then just beyond the silhouetted branches , down the center of the lighted street , there it came , the only kind of vehicle that could move on a night like this a light , airy , oneseated sleigh drawn by a single slim horse trotting easily and silently through the snowthe sleigh had no top they sat out in the falling snow , bundled snugly together under a robe , a man and a woman passing

only a few years ago , few lost causes seemed quite as irretrievably lost as opposing the death penalty not only did 8 out of 10 americans favor capital punishment in 1994 , but that proportion had been growing for over a quarter of a century such overwhelming support may still exist for the execution of timothy j mcveigh , but not for the death penalty generally this shift in public opinion is remarkable in itself but so are two other things first , a major factor behind the shift is religion second , virtually no one has thought to complain about that fact according to polls conducted by the pew research center for the people and the press , the public s support for the death penalty has slipped back to 66 percent , about the level typical of the 1950 s , and if other polls are to be believed , even those americans still backing capital punishment harbor doubts about its fairness in practice and its effectiveness in deterring murders at the core of this reassessment , wrote andrew kohut , director of the pew research center , on the oped page of the new york times on thursday , is religion pew center surveys this year show that people most often cite their religious beliefs as a basis for their opposition this is an interesting development , to say the least historically , religion has sanctioned capital punishment far more often than opposed it the god of the bible is not obviously opposed to the death penalty strong arguments in favor of executions for heinous crimes continue to be mounted on religious grounds but in recent years religious leaders have issued a steady drumbeat of challenges to capital punishment , at least in its practical application if not in principle of course , many liberal protestant and jewish leaders , along with historic advocates of nonviolence like the quakers , had long questioned the practice then , in 1998 , evangelical leaders pleaded , to no avail , with gov george w bush of texas to spare the life of karla faye tucker , a murderer who was born again on death row and became a model prisoner that appeal forced many conservative christians at least to think twice about the whole process roman catholic reinforcements to antideathpenalty ranks have been swelling since 1983 when cardinal joseph bernardin of chicago succeeded in linking the church s opposition to abortion to a broad ethic of life agenda pope john paul ii made his opposition to capital punishment concrete when he visited st louis in january 1999 and successfully begged gov mel carnahan of missouri to commute the sentence of a man on the brink of execution catholic bishops have not backed off their opposition to the death penalty , even in the case of mr mcveigh granted , none of this might have caught fire with churchgoing citizens except for the cases of wrongful convictions and legal errors increasingly coming to light however , the religious component of the opposition is likely to grow more intense a conference in march at the catholic university of america even raised questions whether catholic prosecutors could seek the death penalty or catholic judges preside over death penalty trials if citizens with religionbased objections to capital punishment came to constitute a fourth of the pool of potential jurors and were barred from serving , could that render those juries unrepresentative or qualify as religious discrimination \? strikingly absent in all of this have been the usual phrases that frequently buzz around religious involvement in politics absolutism , intrusion , imposing sectarian views , mixing church and state one obvious explanation is simple inconsistency among critics of explicitly religious political activity opposing the death penalty , like banning land mines or forgiving poor nations' debts , is their kind of cause and therefore religionbased political activity is fine another explanation would be that religious mobilization against capital punishment seems to escape a stereotypical view held by many people of how religious faith contrasts with secular thinking in forming politically relevant moral convictions the stereotype has it that religiously grounded political convictions arise from otherworldly sources , are inscribed unambiguously in sacred texts \( or interpreted unambiguously by irrefutable authorities \) and must be followed almost slavishly secular convictions , by contrast , are supposedly based on tested evidence and human reasoning , are subject to rethinking and revision and can be compromised if necessary there is some basis for this contrast , particularly in regard to religious systems generally labeled fundamentalist but anyone who has survived a dinnerparty argument about capital punishment knows how both religionbased and secular opposition to the death penalty defy that dichotomy religious opposition can seldom rely on unambiguous texts and almost always requires some degree of rethinking that takes account of tested evidence and human reasoning secular opposition can be no less absolutist in its premises , even though they are based on thisworldly ideals , and as uncompromising in its conclusions but anyone who has survived a dinnerparty argument about abortion might have noticed the same thing despite the different conclusions people reach , the structure of the argumentation itself in terms of reliance on bedrock absolutes , appeals to congenial authorities , citation of empirical evidence and , of course , emotional pitch is often quite similar , whether the contending positions are religious or secular so is the religionbased campaign against capital punishment some exceptional model of religious engagement in politics \? or is it in fact a fairly typical form of that engagement , just exceptional enough to make people reassess their assumptions about how religion actually functions in political life \?
trenton , april 5 acting gov donald t difrancesco took his revenge on his republican opponent for governor today by releasing a sheaf of court records and newspaper stories , most of them old and well known , outlining crimes and misdeeds of people connected to mayor bret schundler s jersey city government the documents contain copies of newspaper articles and court records concerning 11 jersey city residents , some schundler appointees and some people only remotely connected to the mayor none of the documents accuse mr schundler directly of misdeeds their release was seen as a counterattack after the disclosure of evidence about the difrancesco family s troubled real estate ventures , including a new jersey developer s decision to forgive a 225 , 000 loan to mr difrancesco the difrancesco campaign believes those disclosures were dug up and fed to the news media by the schundler campaign , which the schundler campaign denies charlie smith , mr difrancesco s campaign manager , said i think the level of scrutiny that the acting governor and his family have endured at some point warranted an appropriate level of scrutiny on mayor schundler and on the reckless manner that he has managed city government the documents , amounting to more than 50 pages of court records and newspaper clippings , were left for state house reporters this morning without any identification linking them to the difrancesco campaign , an omission that mr smith said resulted from an oversight they outline several serious but wellknown crimes and improprieties by schundler appointees , including the 1999 conviction of russell wallace , a schundler appointee to the city s ethics board , for raping a 13yearold acquaintance in his home mr wallace has won a new trial on appeal the documents also recall the 1998 conviction of james f boylan , a municipal court judge appointed by mr schundler , for extorting sex from women in exchange for quashing their traffic tickets other items in the difrancesco packet strain for a connection to the mayor one points out that the stepdaughter of a deputy mayor pleaded guilty to writing hundreds of fake parking tickets another notes that an investigator hired by a hackensack law firm that held city contracts and has contributed to mr schundler s campaign was accused of running automobile insurance schemes mr schundler was in washington today and did not respond to a request for an interview but he issued a statement saying he was disappointed in mr difrancesco the allegations contained in this package , which his campaign attempted to deliver to the press by stealth , have all been properly reported and adjudicated there is no evidence of special treatment in these cases , and the justice system is working properly in each of these instances david p rebovich , a political scientist at rider university , speculated that mr difrancesco s audience for his broadside was the republican leaders who have become worried about his chances in the june primary against mr schundler first of all , there was the talk last week that people were having second thoughts about difrancesco and his prospects , and second , schundler has jumped on difrancesco s personal and family problems with the real estate deals as disqualifying him and giving the wrong image for a governor , mr rebovich said and , third , schundler has just started his radio campaign saying that difrancesco has been around too long i just think the difrancesco campaign thought , 'hey , we 've got to respond' the difrancesco documents maintain that mr schundler did not try to force mr wallace from city government after he was charge with sexual assault , and they say that the mayor only reassigned a city employee who was caught using a city charge card to pay for adult entertainment let me go right to the point here , mr smith , mr difrancesco s campaign manager , said in an interview this is bad government the issue here is how the government of jersey city is administered , and all of the issues here are well within the purview of mayor schundler s government

the 61yearold hospital stockroom worker stricken by new york s first case of inhalation anthrax died early yesterday , the fourth fatality nationwide in a stillunfolding anthrax scare that has turned into an even more troubling mystery the news of the death of the hospital worker , kathy t nguyen of the bronx , came on a day when city health officials announced that they were trying to confirm whether another employee at the hospital , the manhattan eye , ear and throat hospital , had the less serious skin version of the disease and in new jersey , health officials announced that another postal worker , this one at a mail sorting and distribution center near camden , was suspected to be infected with skin anthrax meanwhile , dozens of federal and city investigators fanned out across new york as they began the painstaking process of figuring out ms nguyen s whereabouts over the last two weeks , the time period during which she was most likely exposed it is a task complicated by the fact that ms nguyen was so ill from the time she was admitted to lenox hill hospital sunday night that investigators were not able to speak with her before she died what we are trying to do is backtrack in this woman s life to see who her friends were , who she associated with , who knows where she has been , police commissioner bernard b kerik said at an afternoon news conference at city hall the obvious hope , the officials said , is that they will be able to find the source of the deadly spores that infected her , as well as determine who sent them or brought them to new york so far , dozens of tests at the hospital and at ms nguyen s apartment in the crotona park east section of the bronx have come back negative , mayor rudolph w giuliani said yesterday but there was at least one potentially helpful development preliminary tests indicated that the clothing ms nguyen was wearing when she checked into lenox hill hospital had traces of anthrax bacteria health officials said they did not think it likely that the contamination of the clothes , if confirmed , could have resulted from ms nguyen s merely wearing them , and that the traces are likely to have wound up on her clothing at the time of her exposure still , while the finding seemed a possibly concrete piece of evidence in a case without hard leads , it clearly did not promise to solve the case , officials said the result is that as of yesterday evening investigators had far more questions than answers they plainly understood the intense desire for headway in ms nguyen s case , given that it was the first anthrax infection in new york not connected to the news media , a fact that has stoked concern that the public may be at risk but city and federal officials did not want to understate the challenge they face in solving the case the reality of this is , this is a much more difficult investigation , mr giuliani said , comparing it to the range of city anthrax cases since oct 12 , at the new york post , and at the news offices of nbc , abc and cbs , none of which have been solved it does not mean it ca n't be done it just means it s going to take a while longer city health officials yesterday acknowledged that medical workers were on a new level of alert in their efforts to recognize and treat people whose flulike symptoms might in fact be anthrax manhattan eye , ear and throat hospital remained closed yesterday and officials said it could remain shut for the rest of the week and for the second straight day , scores of the hospital s employees and patients lined up at nearby lenox hill hospital to receive advice and treatment even as the inquiry in new york intensified , the reach of anthrax cases in new jersey grew yet again yesterday officials there announced that a postal employee at the bellmawr center , near camden , was suspected of having cutaneous anthrax , the form of the disease that in most cases can be treated successfully with antibiotics the employee , a 54yearold delaware man , works as a mail processor the center , the state s largest sorting and distribution depot , employs 1 , 300 and sorts mail for more than 150 post offices in south jersey up until yesterday , almost all of the positive anthrax finds in new jersey had been in the trenton area , with most of them occurring at a hamilton township sorting center farther north in new jersey if the bellmawr infection is confirmed , the area within the state that has been affected by the anthrax attacks will suddenly be much larger the bellmawr office was closed yesterday , and officials said that a small amount of mail inside it would remain there until they had confirmed that the building was not contaminated the tests on the bellmawr employee were still not final , but the man is already being treated with antibiotics for a skin lesion that developed on oct 13 his infection , if it is confirmed , would be a mild case and he is expected to recover fully as in new york , new jersey officials were expressing a certain amount of bewilderment about the recent developments on monday , a 51yearold new jersey woman who works in an accounting office near the hamilton postal center was reported to have cutaneous anthrax , even though she had not been to the post office in recent memory nor received any suspicious mail
watching the stanley cup finals in recent seasons has been like watching the end of a 262mile marathon on a hot and humid day just as runners hit the wall of physical and psychological fatigue at about the 20th mile , hockey teams also deteriorate in the fourth round of a twomonth tournament just as the rest of a road race is run and won by elite athletes through will as much as skill , the nhl s championship round is decided in a similar test between its two best teams so both the devils and the colorado avalanche will drag their battered bodies and two victories each into game 5 tonight in the pepsi center in denver it will be their fifth match in 10 days and the third change of venue for the devils a schedule like this is taxing even at midseason to inflict it on athletes who have played more than 100 games over eight months , and to demand it when the stakes are highest , and to schedule it in warm weather in the mile high city is to risk debilitating injury and disproportionate outbursts of emotion but that s the format , so here they go again game 4 , a 32 devils victory saturday night in the meadowlands , provided great drama and two disturbing bookends of injury in the first minute , jason arnott of the devils was hit in the temple by a puck near the end , milan hejduk of the avalanche banged his head on the ice and sustained a bloody facial cut after a high , hard check from the devils' bobby holik both arnott and hejduk are scoring stars if they sustained concussions , their teams are n't saying , but their availability for game 5 is not certain the devils are without randy mckay , a rugged forward , who broke his hand in game 1 of this series the avalanche is without peter forsberg , one of the best players in the world , who had his spleen removed earlier in the tournament there is a brutal beauty to hockey when great teams play with such intensity it may not be freeflowing because of all the defensive diligence , but it is passionate and the bravery of the players is unquestioned for the spectators , the tense mood in continental arena on saturday night was the visceral sort that makes pulses pound , palms perspire and voices shout out when colorado goalie patrick roy made the turnover that led to a tying goal by scott gomez midway through the third period , the rush of energy was like that of an airplane gathering speed on a runway before takeoff and that feeling soared when petr sykora scored the winning goal in the 58th minute , leaving fans giddy but one of the best stretches of action came midway through the second period a fluky confluence of penalties left the teams playing with only three skaters each , instead of the usual five , for more than a minute suddenly , there was open ice for skilled players the pace got faster there were fewer collisions and better scoring chances compare it to highway driving traffic jams are tense , but fine cars running at high speeds can be both tense and exciting perhaps this was a hint of how the sport could be improved in recent days , ideas have come from respected figures like wayne gretzky , part owner of the phoenix coyotes , and ken dryden , president of the toronto maple leafs gretzky has suggested eliminating the center red line in offsides passes this might spread players out and speed the tempo dryden has suggested playing with four skaters instead of five such ideas have been offered in the past and dismissed with a sniff by the nhl s rulers when they come from former players with hall of fame credentials who now direct teams , they deserve serious discussion the league might take a hint from the nba , which will allow zone defenses next season in an attempt to inject imagination into predictable offensive schemes the game will still be recognizable as basketball it might be better basketball hockey without a red line or with fewer skaters would still be hockey it might be better hockey and it might be safer and more entertaining other improvements would be even easier to accomplish try shortening the regular season and ending the playoffs before june turn down the obnoxiously loud music in the arenas and screen it for xrated lyrics encourage the american networks televising the games to hire producers , directors and camera operators who are familiar with hockey s rhythms and details and know what to show and when to show it none of this is to suggest that the finals of 2001 have been bad theater , in person or on television so far , the series has been good but not great should both teams play well at the same time in these final nights , the concluding games may be memorable you just hope no one gets seriously hurt and that casual fans stopping by for a glimpse will see why hockey buffs love this sport , despite its warts photo physical play , a taxing crosscountry schedule with little rest and high stakes increase the risk to the stanley cup finalists , like the devils' fallen jay pandolfo \( chang w lee the new york times \)
three years ago , white plains was a city in decline the tax base had been dropping for more than a decade , and the office vacancy rate was more than 30 percent the highest in the world for cities of its size you could fire a cannon in the downtown area at night and not hit anybody , said joseph m delfino , who became mayor in 1998 so the mayor and his aides looked for a model to help guide their efforts to bring the city back to life they found one 15 miles northeast , in stamford that connecticut city , after all , had been in similarly dire straits only a few years earlier , with its vacancy rate close to 30 percent , and the streets around its gleaming office towers empty and forbidding but it had risen from the ashes with amazing speed , in part by building new highrise residential towers and adding dozens of restaurants and bars in the downtown area we looked very closely at what they did in their downtown , said paul wood , an aide to mr delfino the renewal plan white plains arrived at rooted in new housing and entertainment in the downtown area is straight out of the stamford playbook there were other models , mr wood said , but stamford was the clearest , because it was so close and because its history has so paralleled that of white plains although stamford is much larger 377 square miles as opposed to 99 the two cities' downtown areas are of comparable size their demographic makeup , median income and daytime population roughly 200 , 000 are virtually the same both cities are viewed as the center of their respective counties , and both fall under the shadow of new york city , from which they began to draw corporations looking for safer and more suburban settings starting in the 1950 s and 60 s both underwent a similarly dramatic urban renewal , bulldozing large sections of their downtown areas and rebuilding them with vast office towers in the 1970 s and 80 s both built enclosed malls at roughly the same time and those malls helped destroy the existing retail outlets on the city s main retail street , which was known , in both cases , as little fifth avenue both cities have also been held up as examples of what the architecture critic joel garreau has called the edge city , a hastily built agglomeration of office towers and parking garages designed to accommodate the needs of cars more than pedestrians but they also illustrate the ways city planners have tried to revitalize what had been viewed as cold , hostile settings on that front , even a casual visitor can see that stamford has come further than white plains on a weeknight after 8 , white plains is virtually empty , its audible pedestrian signals designed for the blind chiming eerily in the silence in the heart of the downtown , the old macy s building remains vacant , and across from it are discount stores like the 1 limit there are few young people on the streets , and none of the sleek coffee bars that have become almost ubiquitous it is as though the city s clocks had stopped in the last recession and never started again by contrast , stamford s streets at night are often filled with patrons from dozens of new downtown restaurants , bars and the city s two multiscreen movie theaters stamford has also gained more than 1 , 000 units of new residential housing in its downtown area over the last five years , with 2 , 500 more units planned and there are new security and sanitation workers to keep the streets safe and clean the city s office vacancy rate is now about 7 percent , while white plains remains at 134 percent , though it has less than half of stamford s 15 million square feet of office space , said frank tomasulo , a senior vice president at cb richard ellis , a real estate brokerage firm that comparison might seem humbling to a city that has often been viewed as stamford s rival but competition between the cities has mostly been mythological , said edward steinberg , who worked as a planner for white plains and then for stamford over three decades the notion of competition between white plains and stamford has been for the most part in the minds of third parties , he said they were just doing similar things at similar times both cities were founded in the 17th century , and grew slowly over the years white plains , which has been the seat of the westchester county government since 1778 , was mostly residential , with some commerce and the county office buildings , while stamford was a manufacturing town , shipping pianos , bicycles , locks and other goods to new york city from its canal street docks by 1960 , when they decided to participate in the federal urban renewal program , both cities encompassed a series of mostly wealthy residential neighborhoods surrounding a declining urban core in both cities , urban renewal drew opposition in white plains , the 138acre renewal zone the second largest in the country included the city s old commercial center and an old courthouse , parts of which dated to 1830 it also included slum areas and an old hotel called the honeymoon flats that was also a brothel , said alfred del vecchio , who served as the city s mayor from 1976 to 1994 , and has been a white plains resident since 1957 the stamford urban renewal zone had a similar variety of old homes
mike piazza has thick forearms , bulging biceps , sturdy shoulders and a large chest he could stroll into a professional football locker room tomorrow and feel as if he belonged he could moonlight as a bouncer at any club in manhattan if he ever wanted to supplement his 13 millionayear salary he is big , strong and athletic you have to be big , strong and athletic to do what piazza did yesterday piazza used a onehanded swing , which was a little bit of a lunge and a lot of wrist power , to club a titanic homer off chris michalak and help the mets rumble to a 62 victory over the toronto blue jays before 32 , 138 at shea stadium the ball soared over the picnic area beyond left field as piazza s 301st career homer traveled almost as far as his 300th did on friday night when michalak \( 67 \) tossed a 22 curveball to piazza with a runner on in the fifth inning , he was hoping piazza would be fooled but piazza leaned forward , noticed that it was an offspeed pitch , let his left hand carry most of the swing through the strike zone and ripped the low pitch 430 feet even the usually humble piazza eased out of the batter s box to gaze at his unusual homer the umpire said that he hit a golf ball like that once , piazza said i said , 'i have , too , once or twice' every now and then , i'm able to go down and hit a ball really hard down there i ca n't explain it i wish i could do it more you just react a relieved and appreciative mets manager bobby valentine said , i ca n't believe he hit that out behind piazza s power , rick reed s seven reliable innings and joe mcewing s three hits and two runs batted in , the mets continued their mild revival by winning for the third time in four games this streak is not much to get excited about yet the mets \( 4152 \) need to win three out of four for a month and then see if it matters , but , for the last few days , they have looked and performed like a superior team when you are getting hits with men on base and making defensive plays , it looks good , valentine said reed \( 84 \) had not pitched in 12 days because of neck spasms and the allstar game break and he said that he felt out of whack on the mound except when he needed to get pivotal outs reed abandoned his fastball in the early innings because he kept leaving it up in the strike zone , and used more curveballs he returned to throwing more fastballs in the middle innings , and other than raul mondesi s tworun homer in the fourth , he silenced the blue jays while striking out eight and walking none he did not have any pains in his neck if i can throw like that and be out of whack , reed said , i 'll take it the mets were in control all afternoon , and whenever the blue jays threatened , the mets quickly suppressed them mcewing began the first with a sweet bunt single and scored on piazza s double mcewing , who is batting 444 as a leadoff hitter , poked a twoout , twostrike double in the second to give reed a 30 cushion after mondesi s homer in the fourth made it 32 , benny agbayani had a oneout single in the fifth then piazza , who was already 2 for 2 off michalak , ambled to the plate he has been using a stance in which his feet are wider apart and he is crouching more , changes that he feels give him more control of his hands and prevent him from pulling his head away from the ball piazza looked off balance as he swung at michalak s curveball , but strength allowed him to push the ball over the fence the homer changed the game and had the mets whispering about momentum we threw away the first half , reed said that s in the past right now , it s like a new season for us we 've got to play the second half give it another run and see what happens piazza thought the baggy replica uniforms that the mets and blue jays wore to honor the negro leagues were really cool the mets wore the uniforms of the new york cubans while the blue jays wore those of the chatham allstars since yesterday was the first time in 23 games the mets had scored at least six runs , piazza lobbied for a repeat performance i was honored to wear those uniforms and honored to get a chance to meet those players , piazza said i'm one for changing our name to the cubans if we score this many runs every day inside pitch mike piazza needed a triple in his final atbat to hit for the cycle , but he popped out i have two triples in my career , where the outfielders both had heart attacks , said piazza , who actually has four triples tsuyoshi shinjo \( strained left quadriceps \) played his second rehabilitation game for the class a brooklyn cyclones yesterday and could be activated by the mets tonight photos john franco pitched a perfect eighth inning yesterday , striking out two and getting raul mondesi on a grounder back to the mound

professionals on the national team , we had a lot of time to prepare , to get comfortable , gao said over here , no one knows each other and they put us on the field to play in preseason games , the defenders who do n't know gao s aggressive style tended to play certain balls she normally pursues , and that cost the power a couple of goals then there is the issue of gao having to navigate the hofstra university campus , where the power is based , and long island gao never had to worry about transportation while with the chinese nationals none of the players did , but welcome to life in the fast lane of the american suburbs she took her test for a learner s permit last week and is studying english at nassau community college she will soon move into an apartment with the power s norwegian

milbrett , the 5foot2 dynamo and possibly the world s best player , should help we know we have a responsibility to sell the league and make sure it stays around forever , milbrett said whether the women already answered the question of marketplace viability during the world cup , as milbrett contended , is a subject for debate that should be settled soon enough as startups go , at least the wusa is one to root for unlike that embarrassment of a football league polluting the airwaves the past few weeks , the wusa has a proper sense of proportion , relating to the size of its venues like the national basketball association , which featured the debut thursday of its first chinese player , wang zhizhi , the wusa has the best players , too , domestic and imported i'm really glad the sports arena has opened up , said gao , an acquaintance of the dallas mavericks' newest 7footer we 're making connections with other countries relocation is part of the deal , even for milbrett , whose preference was to stay close to her portland , ore , home it s worked out for the best , she said , a revelation that struck her one day in san diego , during a natural lapse in her limited

juno juliet by julian gough 270 pages nan a talese doubleday 2395 julian gough s debut novel is a light romantic irish comedy , undermined by trying hard to please , not just on its own terms but seemingly as some future summer film it is one thing for hollywood to sign up hugh grant in a part already written it is quite another for a novelist , in advance , to sign up the actor s floppy forelock and winsome distress for his male protagonist mr gough recounts the adventures of two sisters from a provincial tipperary home who find freedom and plight as university students in the lately fashionable and cosmopolitan city of galway juno is beautiful , airy and innocent juliet , the narrator , is toughtalking , suspicious and protective it is not long , though , before she lets us know that we would be quite wrong to think of her as juno s plain , downtoearth sidekick not only is juliet just as innocent , at bottom , but she is also just as goodlooking being , in fact , juno s twin i had the same serene beauty as juno but i cooperated with it less it is tempting to suspect that such a neatly phrased , haveitallways arrangement is more to do with casting than with fiction juno is beautiful to the point where it might as well be a disfigurement , her sister tells us , adding , she s invisible behind it juliet is not invisible and certainly not inaudible mr gough does indeed distinguish between the twins sometimes with graceful precision at the time i did n't believe in love , juliet announces at the start juno believed in love believing in it did n't protect her not believing in it did n't protect me it was an interesting year juno juliet is the story of that year there is the struggle to find somewhere to live in a smallish town flooded with students a devout elderly cousin recommends a friend whose pasttheshelfdate catholicism seems narrow even to her charging ridiculously little for a spacious waterside apartment , the friend apologizes for a tiny rent rise it was owing to inflation , she explains , caused by the jewishcommunist conspiracy as with the housing crisis , pretty much every other problem that awaits the sisters falls into a twosequence pattern dissonant minor key followed by sunny major juno takes up with michael , a talkative , kindly but clumsy fellow student they court , sleep together , quarrel in a moment of weakness , michael has sex with juliet \( her own moment of weakness \) both regret it , the sisters make up , and eventually michael is restored to conditional favor feeling sorry for conrad , a playedout writer , juno lets him make love to her only to discover that he prefers rape he receives a violent comeuppance an identical fate is dealt to the anonymous writer of several hurtfully obscene letters who the writer is provides one of the novel s subplots and an auxiliary note of suspense , though one that does n't actually suspend except for juliet and her bumpy romance with a teacher the floppy forelock , whom i 've yet to introduce none of the characters or their situations is written with much conviction they are not action but a rickety highkicking in the background while juliet s own story plays out even juno is wispy , though the author has captured her perfectly in the phrase about beauty and invisibility witty phrases , and several that are thoughtfully provocative , are mr gough s strength it can seem , in fact , that he devises his characters largely for the sake of what he \( or juliet , his narrator \) will say about them juliet comments on her troubles and perplexities more sharply than she experiences them my vice is the victorian vice of sentimentality , not the modern vice of irony , she announces this is true too true she and david hennessey , her teacher , each arrive early at his first class he introduces himself with the endearing fluster he retains pretty much throughout i'm taking this tutorial , i mean , giving it , he tells juliet i must say , i feel a terrible fraud people have been calling me professor students , i mean i 've been doing bellow and updike and nabokov with the third years and most of them look older than me and i can tell they do n't believe a word i'm saying pehaps he should knit himself a gray beard can you knit \? he wonders a little of this goes a long way after some resistance it goes a long way with juliet there is not a little of it , though as the year goes by david will run into her and let her help him foodshop he will invite her to dinner they churn by motorboat across choppy galway bay to the picturesque tower where he lives with his invalid father windswept , she gets to drive father is a man of pithy charm , and immensely rich from his invention of an underwater oil drill the attractively awkward david comes now the forelock prepares an excellent dinner with fine wine and talk there is a seabattered night walk and the mutual burgeoning of desire , slowed by misunderstandings and standstills he had thought her young and was afraid of hurting her she convinces him that hurting is the chance you take having met cute , they end cuter charmobject aside , david serves another purpose ideaobject he delivers a couple of classroom rants on political correctness and on the pretentiousness , elitism and plain unreadibility of much contemporary literature and literary theory apart from likely pleasing the wall street journal , the arguments that the author gets david to deliver are graceful and sensitive not bludgeons but invitations to dialogue of course he gives us nobody to dialogue with mr gough is a clever writer he is simply not , or not yet \( judging from this first effort \) , a very good novelist one who makes the demands on himself that even a comic romance requires juno juliet is a pungent dressing on mushy greens fiction for the rest of us , the publisher has labeled it but who is this us \?

trade , which contributed so powerfully to the world s growth for much of the 1990 s , had been falling everywhere even before the sept 11 terrorist attacks , pulling national economies down with it now , with the prospect of further economic fallout from the war against terrorism , the damage is expected to increase , sidelining global trade as a force for economic recovery the numbers are particularly startling for the united states exports of goods and services reached a high last year of 114 percent of the value of the country s total economic activity , and then dropped by nearly a percentage point equivalent to almost 100 billion in annual exports in just nine months that was enough to help push a weakening economy into a slump the same pattern was evident worldwide , despite the considerable progress in recent years in pulling down trade barriers the bush administration , trying to reverse the trend , sees the terrorist attacks as an opportunity to push harder than ever for a new round of negotiations that would knock down more trade barriers administration officials argue that by lowering tariffs and other obstacles once again , they can to some extent counter the new costs of moving merchandise across borders that have arisen since sept 11 , in effect offsetting new frictions by removing old ones i do not see any reason why sept 11 , if we follow the right policies , should have any negative impact on the ability of people to exchange goods and services around the world , said john b taylor , the treasury department s under secretary for international affairs more globalization and fewer tariffs , he added , will emphasize that trade is a good source of economic growth jeffrey schott , a trade expert at the institute for international economics in washington , agreed not going forward with these initiatives , he said , increases the risk that a country will revert to protectionist measures in response to recession and unemployment lower tariffs would help companies like lands' end , the catalog retailer , which imports 70 percent of its merchandise , mostly apparel immediately after the attacks , shipments arrived a day late because of the extra security procedures , said charlotte lacomb , manager of investor relations , and then the customs brokers and freight forwarders , the people who handle our shipments , instituted a small surcharge this terrorist tax is still too slight to prompt lands' end to purchase less from abroad , ms lacomb said but it raises new concerns for thousands of companies engaged in crossborder transactions that is one reason the administration offers as justification for pushing so hard on the international trade front it finally forged a compromise with moderate democrats last week in hopes of achieving quick passage of a bill that would grant the president the right to negotiate trade agreements without being secondguessed by congress under the bill , lawmakers could only approve or reject trade deals but could not amend or rewrite them a concession that congress has denied to the white house for nearly a decade the administration also stepped up the pressure to start a new round of tarifflowering negotiations under the umbrella of the world trade organization at a scheduled meeting in qatar in november , and new agreements in the western hemisphere that would in effect extend the north american free trade agreement , known as nafta , to nearly every nation this administration will fight for open markets and free trade , robert b zoellick , the united states trade representative , declared in an outspoken speech right after the attacks the global trading system , he added , has demonstrated from seoul to santiago that it is a pathway out of poverty and despair not everybody agrees with that claim the economic theory that underlies mr zoellick s argument sometimes fails to work as advertised , or works better for some countries than others , some economists argue the antiglobalization demonstrators who first appeared in strength at a world trade organization meeting in seattle two years ago embrace this view the important thing to remember is that none of these trade agreements are about free trade , said thea lee , an international economist at the aflcio they are about trade with rules , managed trade , and then the question is managed in whose interest \? nafta , she argues , was more in the interest of american companies than mexican enterprises mexico , for example , was required to prolong patent protection on drugs to match patent protection in the united states , she said that helped american pharmaceutical companies export brandname drugs , but mexicans must now wait longer to purchase lessexpensive generic drugs most economists , however , argue that freer trade makes it easier for nearly all countries to increase production , profits and income when the rising output of goods and services can be sold freely abroad as well as at home nafta enormously expanded mexico s access to the united states market , said barry eichengreen , an economist at the university of california at berkeley
with a strike deadline looming in hollywood next week , the major film and television studios are presenting a united front against the writers , who are demanding higher residuals money from the subsequent use of the films and tv shows for which they have written scripts despite the show of unity by the studios , and the fact that they are owned by powerful media conglomerates like aol time warner , the news corporation and viacom , the companies are not eager to take a hard line against the writers guild of america within each big media company , and among the companies , there are simply too many interlocking pieces and meshing gears for the studios to risk a long strike by the writers warner brothers , for example , is owned by aol time warner , whose magazines and internet business could help the corporation endure the revenue shortfall from a shortterm strike but aol time warner might also worry that a long strike could risk viewer defection at its wb television network , if the network went too long without fresh episodes of popular shows like seventh heaven and there are also constraints against any one company s breaking ranks to negotiate its own deal with the writers news corporation s fox television network , for example , might seem to have an incentive to go it alone , because it already pays lower rates to guild writers than the other major networks as a legacy of fox s having been a struggling startup not so many years ago but a renegade move would risk upsetting the industry symbiosis that enabled the news corporation s 20th century fox television studio to reach a 1023 million deal last week to move its hit series buffy the vampire slayer to viacom s upn network rather than big media being a juggernaut , in other words , the industry in the age of conglomerates depends on a system of checks and balances a structure that cannot help but influence the way the media companies conduct their checkbook negotiations with the writers either we hang together or we hang separately , said one toplevel studio executive , speaking on condition of anonymity if the unions set one against another , the studios are the losers each side in the negotiations declined to make someone available to comment yesterday but according to people close to the discussions , the studios and writers are dealing with lesser issues right now , and saving the thorny question of residuals until closer to the strike deadline at 12 01 am next wednesday the media companies are not all the same in their willingness to settle with the writers or to court the risks of a strike , of course vivendi , for example , is generally considered to be in a better position than some others to withstand at least a short hollywood strike , because its universal entertainment business is only one part of a diversified portfolio that includes european water , waste management and telecommunications operations but it is difficult to assess the strike tolerance of even a pureplay media conglomerate , because it depends on which part of the company one is talking about viacom provides a good case in point viacom , which yesterday reported a 6 percent increase in firstquarter revenue , to 575 billion , is a farflung empire that includes the cbs and upn networks 35 television stations the paramount pictures and paramount television studios , and cable networks like mtv and showtime a writers strike could have an impact on all of those businesses , to varying degrees but a strike would have only minimal impact on viacom s syndicatedprogramming business , king world productions , which licenses the broadcast rights to shows like oprah and wheel of fortune , programs with very little scripting and a strike would probably have no effect on viacom s infinity broadcasting unit the radio station and outdoor advertising business that accounted for about a third of viacom s 455 billion in cash flow last year for viacom , like the other owners of movie studios , a strike by screenwriters would not be immediately evident at the box office summer films are either already completed or in the final stages of editing and knowing the writers' contract deadline was approaching , and with an eye toward the june 30 expiration of the screen actors guild contract , paramount pictures has scrambled in recent months to finish other movies , like vanilla sky with tom cruise , to build up an inventory that could last into next year if necessary it is in television where viacom , like its industry counterparts , has the more complicated set of considerations as viacom announced its firstquarter financial results yesterday , fred reynolds , president of the company s cbs television stations unit , said that viacom s projected doubledigit cash flow growth for the year was partly dependent on the fall television season s not being disrupted by a strike at various networks , executives have been saying that a short strike will not damage the first weeks of the fall season , because some episodes of entertainment programs have already been completed
canton , miss , sept 7 like the bulldozers now flattening several square miles of central mississippi , this state has allowed nothing to stop its effort to acquire a huge nissan truck factory and finally take its place in the international economy it outbid every other competing state for the plant with the largest package of taxfinanced incentives ever offered to an automaker in the united states , estimated at more than 400 million in spending and tax rebates as part of the package , mississippi agreed to pay for an 80 million jobtraining program for nissan workers and to build the factory s 17 million vehiclepreparation building it promised 60 million in new and improved roads , to be built far faster than most state roads it even allowed nissan executives to use a state plane for several months most significant , it agreed to acquire more than 1 , 500 acres nissan wanted nearly 25 square miles using the state s power of eminent domain , if necessary , to move out homeowners living on the site near this small town of 10 , 000 , about 15 miles north of jackson and that is when the highrevving engine of mississippi s new economy ran directly into the archie and bouldin families , a small but unyielding pocket of an older mississippi that is not quite as impressed by the rush to join the global economy these related black families , who for 60 years have owned an isolated green enclave where nissan wants to put a parking lot and an access road , have spurned the state s offer of more than a halfmillion dollars for their land , and have gone to court to challenge the condemnation procedure the families have charged that the state acted in a racially biased manner by treating white and black landowners differently , and while nissan has begun construction next to their property , they have become the most prominent obstacles to the fulfillment of the state s promise to the company although many white landowners received less money per acre than the state is offering the black families , the dispute makes it clear that mississippi can never entirely escape the effects of its past , even at the precise moment that it is moving a great deal of earth to do so my grandfather bought this land in 1941 , said lonzo archie , 45 , a welder who lives with his family of five in a modest brick house on the south edge of the nissan project there s 15 of our families right around here , and none of them want to live anywhere else but then the state comes in and pushes us around and tells us they 're going to turn our land over to a private company it s not right state officials said the families were simply holding out for more money , and produced extensive figures to show that black and white landowners in the area were not being treated differently but even though the family owns just 23 acres of the land sought for the project , officials at the state s economic development agency said they must seize those acres because of a larger principle the need to demonstrate to businesses around the country that they are utterly serious about attracting big corporate investments it s not that nissan is going to leave if we do n't get that land , said james c burns jr , the executive director of the mississippi development authority what s important is the message it would send to other companies if we are unable to do what we said we would do if you make a promise to a company like nissan , you have to be able to follow through regularly derided as the nation s poorest state with the least educated population , and mired in a largely agricultural economy , mississippi spent years watching with increasing frustration as foreign automakers placed their highwage jobs and hightech factories in other southern states , like alabama , tennessee and south carolina mr burns acknowledged that mercedesbenz and honda never seriously considered mississippi before choosing sites for large factories in the 1990 s there was this perception out there that we just could n't do what it takes , either financially or physically , said mr burns , a former banker appointed to the job last year by gov ronnie musgrove what we had to do was show companies what we were capable of when nissan quietly informed mississippi and several other states of its interest in the spring of last year , the musgrove administration quickly mobilized , determined to come up with a more generous incentive package than its neighbors while alabama had offered 253 million to mercedesbenz in 1993 , mississippi spent four months preparing a 295 million package for nissan , an amount that did not include the 5 , 000aworker tax credit and the rollbacks of county property taxes in a oneday special session last november , the legislature unanimously passed a 30 , 000word bill granting a variety of privileges to the project and specifically granting the state the power to take whatever land it deemed necessary to turn over to nissan alabama , mississippi s main competitor for the project , had never used its eminent domain power for its auto plants
in a longexpected move , cond nast s chief executive , steven t florio , and the company s editorial director , james truman , asked the editor in chief of glamour magazine , bonnie fuller , to resign yesterday ms fuller , who has been editor of the women s magazine since 1998 , had a contract with cond nast that was to expire in august cond nast executives said ms fuller had been asked to resign because of glamour s recent poor performance on the newsstand in addition , cond nast editors said that during her tenure she never quite got off on the right foot with cond nast s top management and editors , angering her bosses , including mr florio and anna wintour , the editor in chief of vogue executives said they expected ms fuller to leave within the week while glamour staff members said ms fuller said she was surprised to be asked to leave so soon , cond nast executives said that si newhouse jr , the chairman of advance publications , had anticipated ms fuller s resignation since 1999 , when ms fuller flirted publicly with cond nast s archrival , hearst magazines at the time , cathleen p black , the president of hearst magazines , had asked ms fuller to consider editing harper s bazaar , the 134yearold hearst fashion monthly , and ms fuller had even discussed with mr newhouse breaching her contract she was sternly reprimanded by mr florio for considering that option last summer , buoyed by reports of sluggish newsstand sales for harper s bazaar , ms fuller again made herself available to hearst management , further angering cond nast management glamour s poor newsstand performance recently has been mirrored by many other magazines but for a large magazine that depends on the newsstand for half its circulation , any downturn is considered serious according to the audit bureau of circulations , newsstand sales for the magazine , which has a circulation of 21 million , were down by 11 percent for the last six months of 2000 , and cond nast executives said glamour s newsstand sales had dropped even lower for the first three months of this year but it was a recent inhouse imbroglio that may have been the last straw ms fuller featured a photograph of the actress catherine zetajones on the june cover without the cooperation of ms zetajones' public relations managers , thereby undermining plans by vogue s editor in chief , ms wintour , for that magazine s july cover , also featuring ms zetajones this episode was reported yesterday by the new york post , along with a report that ms fuller might be asked to resign but an extra twist further provoked cond nast management glamour is an international magazine , with several foreign editions , and according to cond nast executives , none of the international editions had permission to use glamour s june cover of ms zetajones , prompting a logistical problem according to a cond nast executive , ms wintour was casually consulted and approved of ms fuller s exit mr florio and mr truman declined , through a spokeswoman , to speak about ms fuller under ms fuller , the magazine departed from the formula that the former editor , ruth whitney , had established over a 31year stewardship , removing a political column , adding horoscopes and using provocative cover lines about orgasms the departure of ms fuller has set into motion an editorial merrygoround at the women s magazines at cond nast , cindi leive , the editor in chief of self since 1999 , will take over at glamour and is expected by many to return it to its more traditional roots cond nast executives said that lesley jane seymour , the editor in chief of hearst s redbook , had been asked to consider taking over at self as for ms fuller , no announcement was made about her plans according to a cond nast executive , ms fuller did place a phone call to a lawyer yesterday who has represented deposed cond nast editors in the past

paris , june 3 upon his surreal resurrection on the grounds of roland garros , inspired by the chanting brazilians in the stands , gustavo kuerten turned the clay court into an etch a sketch he walked to the service line , stuck his racket tip into the dirt and drew a fullbodied heart in the back court he then knelt inside his makeshift valentine , blew kisses to the crowd , then hustled to stuff his duffel bag in an instant , kuerten was heading for the door , respectfully leaving the stage to michael russell usually , the winner lingers but kuerten understood how this american qualifier on a mcdonald s budget , how this unknown who travels like thirdclass mail , deserved a solo moment with the crowd although giddy over guga , the kuerten fans drenched russell with affectionate roars of approval as he dragged his boxcar body off the center court more than anything , russell had earned their respect after jangling their nerves during a 36 , 46 , 76 \( 3 \) , 63 , 61 victory by an emotional kuerten maybe one of the greatest feelings in all my life was on the tennis court today , kuerten said i like to fight a lot , to give it all sometimes , a payback like today , it s more than anything you can ask for russell s performance went beyond expectations as well on court , his talent did not hint at his newcomer s status off the court , his living conditions gave him away earlier this week , he was pleading with a desk clerk to move him from the sweatbox he was renting to an airconditioned pad when turned down , he sneaked his bags into the room of a departing player , harel levy , and remained under his name today , russell s resourcefulness was in full bloom against kuerten for almost three sets , he used delicate drop shots and mindblowing speed , unabashed passing swipes and his slinky flexibility to put himself in an unfathomable position against kuerten , the twotime french open champion russell had match point up by two sets to none , ahead by 53 on his serve , russell had created a tantalizing opportunity but 26 strokes into a wild rally later , russell s fate was decided after he slid into splits to reach angled shots and heard the crowd murmur when one kuerten stroke caught the back of the line , russell s pixie dust expired it s unfortunate we have umpires because i would have called it out , joked russell , who eventually lost the point on a kuerten forehand winner obviously , i look back on it now and say , 'what if i would have served and volleyed' i played a solid point , but i did n't take it i was n't aggressive enough with it the no 1 player in the world , he s not going to give you the match he stepped up , and he cracked a forehand from there , he took control of the match that fleeting match point deflated russell s precision he had 29 unforced errors in the first two sets , but 28 in the pivotal third suddenly , his sliced backhands were landing shorter and his returns lost their zip once russell s level slipped just a tad , kuerten discovered his will for a comeback if not for that survival instinct , the outcome could have been the greatest upset in a decade the only other time a qualifier defeated a no 1seeded player in a major was when andrei olhovskiy stunned jim courier at wimbledon in 1992 i think he did so many good things today that he should be the one able to play in the quarterfinal , kuerten said of russell i think on match point , he was a little bit unlucky on the strength of good karma , kuerten will go on to face yevgeny kafelnikov in the quarterfinals other seeded stars in today s round of 16 play like jennifer capriati , martina hingis and serena williams also advanced russell moves on , too wimbledon is next while his ranking has improved from 122 to 85 since last week , the 23yearold russell will have to qualify to get into the main draw at the all england club to him , this is just part of a temporary process soon , if his ranking does not drop , he will land in main draws this week provided him with proof that he belongs on the same court as the elite players there is no doubt he was fascinated by the center court today , but he was not overwhelmed when we first started playing , the stadium was half full , russell said i thought maybe they thought guga was going to blow me off the court or something i look up after two sets , and the brazilian fans are screaming , going crazy it was a great experience i 'd love to do it again he does not want to become content with his brush with fame i'm not going to take this and fold , russell said two years from now , i do n't want people saying , 'whatever happened to michael russell \? ' i do n't want to be someone they never hear from again as a bluecollar player born in detroit , he experienced the drain of playing in 33 tournaments a year and fought off the loneliness of life on the challenger circuit there are no agents or advertisers knocking on the doors in outpost villages only this week was russell approached by a clothing company for his entire career , he has purchased his own sneakers , wearing out 15 pairs a year as an international star , kuerten does not have such problems today , his only trouble was with russell he needed every brazilian chanting guga ! guga ! on his side to win though the grounds crew raked through it quickly enough , his oncourt artwork a heart fit to be taped to a parent s refrigerator was a sign of gratitude i was completely feeling some things that you do n't normally feel these days , kuerten said i saw myself with no chance anymore a big part of my way back was the crowd i really gave all of my effort out there to show them that i could do a little bit better match points belgium is celebrating the continuing success of kim clijsters and justine henin , both of whom advanced to the women s quarterfinals clijsters , seeded 12th , outlasted henrieta nagyova , 64 , 46 , 63 the 14thseeded henin ended the strong run of barbara schett , 63 , 64 photos russell had a match point in the third set against kuerten gustavo kuerten acknowledging the crowd in paris yesterday after rallying to beat the qualifier michael russell , 36 , 46 , 76 \( 3 \) , 63 , 61 \( photographs by associated press \)
in explaining why he felt that an analyst should sit unobtrusively behind his patients' couch , sigmund freud explained that he did not want analysands to be influenced by his physical reactions and facial expressions what is more , he added , i cannot stand being stared at eight hours a day \( or longer \) by others this remark , indeed freud s whole psychoanalytical strategy of fading into the background so that patients might be freed to speak more openly of their problems , has come to mind whenever i have been interviewed by terry gross , host of fresh air , the hourlong show that is broadcast daily on some 300 national public radio stations to around three million listeners the most notable feature of ms gross s singular style of interviewing is that she is rarely in the presence of her guests why \? because most are hundreds , even thousands , of miles away , linked to her only by a satellite while she sits in what she refers to as her black , windowless room , guests mostly authors , musicians , professors , journalists , dancers , scientists and politicians are ensconced in other distant studios , or sometimes simply on a telephone , somewhere else around the world but far from impeding her ability to establish rapport , distance has , counterintuitively , enabled ms gross to create a sense of closeness and engagement that has become a hallmark of what many see as the best interview show in broadcasting as with freud , ms gross s ability to draw her subjects out seems to increase in direct proportion to her separation indeed , being somewhat shy and reserved , she finds it easier to be actively involved in the world by keeping it at a manageable distance i love the invisibility of radio , she told me several years ago in an onstage conversation at the university of california at berkeley there was a time when i would n't allow a picture to be taken i wanted to be invisible and on radio i could probably be naked and the person i'm interviewing would n't know the difference it just does n't matter anonymity can help liberate people from the selfconsciousness that inhibits them in more visible forms of public discourse and nothing better illustrates this paradox of intimacy and distance than radio , when it is used in a thoughtful way the experience of going on fresh air is positively disorienting for people used to confronting their interviewers you enter a studio alone , sit down facing a wall or a control room window and put on a headset when the satellite uplink is established and the familiar voice of terry gross suddenly wafts out of the void into the otherwise silent studio , you do , indeed , feel almost on the couch once housekeeping details are dispatched and the interview begins , the voice in the headphones and the rush of your own thoughts become a total frame of reference the feeling of complete engagement is only enhanced by a guest s awareness that there is actually enough time to converse thoughtfully and thoroughly with an interlocutor who is interested in the subject \( lead interviews run half an hour to 45 minutes , and they suffer relatively little editing \) alone in the studio , it is easy to forget that millions of people will soon be eavesdropping on what feels like a confidential exchange two of the most pleasurable shows i have done for fresh air were taped from china when president clinton was visiting several years ago the plan for my appearances was elegant in its simplicity i would simply telephone ms gross after the frenzy of a day s presidential events was over , and we would talk so , late at night , i would repair to my chinese hotel room , get comfortable on the bed , call whyyfm in philadelphia , where the show originates , and turn out the light for an hour i would describe what had happened that day , ruminate on what had recently been going on in china , talk about how sinoamerican relations were evolving , or discuss anything else that seemed relevant since i was in china , i never actually heard the shows , but i signed off each night with a sense of having been led in an interesting conversation and of actually having the time to convey something of the complexity that is contemporary china what made the exchanges doubly pleasurable was the opportunity to think out loud , even try on some new ideas , something that rarely happens these days in the american media , where only the pithiest statements win air time or a place in print being on fresh air is a reminder of how few broadcast outlets allow listeners and viewers the pleasure of sharing a mind provoked instead , we are bombarded with relentless salvos by talking heads who , like weapons specialists , know exactly what ordnance they will unleash on the public long before they reach makeup what ms gross strives for with her guests is to explore their inner life , their imagination , and the sense of the person , she said this means that most guests need not fear the kind of expected and often prurient questions that are the currency of commercial gotcha interviewers
belfast , northern ireland , aug 12 after a weekend of maneuvering , northern ireland s politicians have pulled back from another of the brinks to which they seem condemned but by angering roman catholics linked to the irish republican army , the contortions used to rescue the home rule assembly , made up of both roman catholics and protestants , may have built yet another brink from which retreat will be increasingly difficult the ailing political process has been put on a life support machine , said noel mcadam , political correspondent of the belfast telegraph in some ways there is a heavy sense of events repeating themselves on july 1 , david trimble , the protestant leader , resigned as first minister of the northern ireland assembly , protesting the ira s refusal to commit itself to a timetable for discarding its arsenal of automatic weapons , explosives and other arms the resignation set off a sixweek period in which by law mr trimble was to be replaced or new elections held that gave the british authorities until saturday to find a way out it suspended the home rule government for 24 hours , until midnight saturday in the process , john reid , britain s northern ireland secretary , created a situation in which one sixweek period was conveniently deemed to have rolled over and another started , creating one more deadline for late september and one more last chance for peace but the central issue is the same as when mr trimble resigned because there is still no firm schedule for ira disarmament last thursday the ira offered publicly to put its weapons completely and verifiably beyond use an offer hailed by republicans as a historic gesture after three decades of conflict and 3 , 600 deaths but mr trimble rejected that offer because it did not offer immediate disarmament the question now is whether the suspension of the assembly one that catholic republicans depict as a humiliating display of british power will now drive the ira away from secret contacts with the disarmament commission led by the canadian general , john de chastelain ominously , martin mcguinness , the chief negotiator for sinn fein , the ira s political wing , said today that the suspension of the assembly may have jeopardized the disarmament offer by rejecting the ira s pledge , he said , mr trimble s ulster unionists had created a grave crisis both protestants and catholics who are committed to the good friday agreement of 1998 are losing ground to hardline opponents within their own ranks in that atmosphere , mr mcguinness s remarks may represent posturing to advance sinn fein s bargaining position ahead of future talks to the british , there has been tangible progress since mr trimble s resignation , in terms of the pledge on disarmament and a plan put forward by london and dublin to close the gaps i believe we are tantalizingly close , mr reid , the ranking british official here , said today this peace process , in its final implementation , is within our grasp there was probably an element of posturing in that statement , too he was referring to the set of proposals that london and dublin advanced on aug 1 linking reforms aimed at overcoming catholic animosity toward the police , along with plans to close british military bases , to ira disarmament the formula tried to resolve the festering issue of disarmament , but in general was considered generous to the ira none of the political parties have accepted the package , but , seeking momentum , mr reid has said he plans to publish the proposals for reforming the police soon but there can be no guarantees of success , mr reid has said indeed , as with just about any idea in this province of 17 million people with its 55 percent protestant majority and 40 percent catholic minority , it seems that no single proposal can win the grudging favor of one side without courting the hostility of the other but those very divisions create pressure on the politicians who support the good friday agreement to strike a deal before they are outflanked british national elections in early june showed both moderate protestants and catholics losing ground in northern ireland sinn fein and hardline protestants led by the rev ian paisley gained among people who feel the good friday agreement has been paid for with too many sacrifices in return for too few gains if the current impasse leads to a new local election for the assembly , then the middle ground of negotiation could be squeezed out altogether mr trimble s position is uncertain , since he is under challenge from fellow protestants opposed to the good friday agreement he has said he will withdraw his resignation as first minister only if the ira commits itself to immediate disarmament and only if he returns as first minister will the northern ireland assembly , the cornerstone of the good friday accord , pull back from the threat of collapse the ira s role is pivotal only the ira can end the stalemate , and , oddly , if it were to come up with a disarmament plan that he could accept , the ira would help to secure mr trimble , its antagonist , against his protestant rivals indeed , the irish author conor cruise o'brien wrote in a dublin newspaper today , for the moment , the ira is a greater force in the actual governance of northern ireland than the british government is photo

brain surgery is better than prolonged drug therapy for treating the most common form of epilepsy , according to the first study that directly compared the two treatments the finding , being published today in the new england journal of medicine , has enormous implications for more than 800 , 000 americans who have a form of the disease called temporal lobe epilepsy experts say that in at least half of these patients , drugs fail to control seizures unlike most other forms of the disease , temporal lobe epilepsy can be treated surgically but only 1 , 500 people each year have the surgery , probably because many neurologists and primary physicians do not recommend it , saying it is risky and should be used only as a last resort to find out if such skepticism was merited , canadian physicians carried out a clinical trial to compare the treatments eighty patients who had trouble controlling their seizures were assigned at random to one of two groups half got the latest epilepsy drugs , and half had surgery the procedure involved removing a clump of abnormal tissue about the size of a package of gum from the side of the brain where their seizures originated all patients were examined regularly for one year by epilepsy experts who did not know which treatment they had received prolonged use of anticonvulsant drugs is futile , said dr samuel wiebe , the neurologist who led the study at the university of western ontario in london , ontario after one year , 58 percent of the surgery patients were free of major seizures , dr wiebe said , compared with 8 percent of those on drug therapy moreover , surgery patients reported a much better quality of life , including the freedom to do what i want when i want , dr wiebe said it s difficult to understand why physicians and patients remain reluctant to choose surgery for epilepsy since this is the only therapy that offers any chance of a cure , said dr jerome engel , an epilepsy expert at the university of california in los angeles who wrote an editorial that accompanied dr wiebe s article the surgery is safer and more effective that ever dr engel noted that uncontrolled seizures increased a patient s risk of dying , and he said he recommended that patients consider surgery if they had tried three anticonvulsant drugs for two years , and had not improved he estimated that at least 100 , 000 people in the united states could benefit from the operation but many neurologists were more cautious i think the surgery is effective , said dr katheryn guggenheim , a neurologist in santa fe , nm but the potential side effects worry me side effects include permanent memory loss , blurred vision and increased risk of stroke two surgical patients in the study lost verbal memory skills , which meant they had trouble following instructions and recalling lists of words five patients continued to have uncontrolled seizures , although less frequently than before the surgery but none of the surgical patients died , whereas one on drug treatment did temporal lobe epilepsy tends to develop in childhood , producing seizures that get worse in adolescence and young adulthood unlike other forms of epilepsy , which involve wide areas of the brain , temporal lobe epilepsy is caused by an abnormal clump of tissue in either the left or right temporal lobe a brain region above the ears the abnormality can be present from birth , or may result from scarring caused by a disease like meningitis or from a blow to the head many patients respond well to drugs , so that their seizures are greatly reduced or eliminated , said dr david ficker , a neurologist at the university of cincinnati but for reasons that are not understood , a substantial number of patients do not improve with drugs they cannot drive , hold a job or enjoy a normal life epilepsy surgery began in the late 1880 s when surgeons removed brain tissue without knowing its function , dr engel said because some patients were left unable to form memories , the surgery got a bad name new surgical and brain imaging techniques have minimized such problems , he said patients can be screened for the surgery at at least 80 epilepsy centers nationwide the operation costs 30 , 000 to 50 , 000 patients who arrive at the centers have typically been on drugs for 15 to 20 years and still have seizures , dr ficker said twothirds of these patients learn about surgery on their own , often via the internet
with a satisfied , almost wistful , smile spreading across his face , gary rodkin , the chief executive of pepsicola , described the kind of teenager who pops into his mind when he thinks about mountain dew code red , the company s newest highcaffeine soda a kid with his hair on end , his eyes bugging out , mr rodkin said he s a little bit on edge such candor from beverage executives used to be rare , given that the major soda makers have long held that their drinks stimulate no physiological effects and pepsi officials are still quick to say that it is the drink s taste and its ties to the original mountain dew not its caffeine content that will lure teenagers with the sirenlike urgency the name is meant to convey but this is a decidedly new era for the major soft drink companies in the last year or so , growth in soda sales has slowed to a trickle , as consumers have developed an affection for a host of new drinks , from elaborate herbal concoctions to plain bottled water and yet sodas still account for as much as 90 percent of sales at the major beverage companies , leaving their executives with the vexing challenge of jumpstarting demand for an everyday product that just does not quite hold that oldtime appeal anymore pressured by the clamoring of investors who have little interest in sitting tight until the slump recedes , almost all the major soda makers are looking to give even their most hyperactive brands a fresh jolt so , in an effort to cure its own woes , pepsi is going back to the strategy that served it so well throughout the 1990 s marketing a drink with plenty of pizazz that promises not just a fresh taste but a little extra kick , too yes , caffeine is of interest to our consumers , said steven s reinemund , chief executive of pepsico , pepsi s parent company the whole idea of being able to provide excitement is critical it s incumbent on us to provide that not that pepsi is positioning code red as an energy drink that will invigorate listless consumers plenty of such beverages can be found on the market these days , including a nonalcoholic pickmeup from anheuserbusch instead , pepsi is relying more on image than actual substance , careful to avoid promising any specific effects from the drink that might prompt greater scrutiny from regulators and parents indeed , while code red has nearly 45 percent more caffeine than most sodas , that is hardly a tremendous dose , scientists say the food and drug administration allows up to 6 milligrams of the substance per ounce of soda , and code red stays safely below that limit at about 46 milligrams nevertheless , that is significantly higher than most other soft drinks coke has about 28 milligrams per ounce , pepsi almost 32 , while some iced teas have less than 1 but even the most heavily caffeinated sodas do not compare to coffee in fact , a 20ounce bottle of code red , the smallest size in which the drink will initially be sold , only contains about as much caffeine as a strong cup of homebrewed coffee still , that is just a fraction shy of the amount necessary to produce physical dependency in a habitual drinker , child or adult , some scientists say without their daily intake , caffeine addicts can experience withdrawal symptoms like headaches or anxiety to shake off the malaise , they simply tend to ingest more of the substance , thus reinforcing the habit , according to the office of the surgeon general of the united states aside from the occasional discomfort , however , there appear to be very few longterm effects of caffeine addiction , if any although some researchers have argued that drinking soft drinks may put children at greater risk of breaking bones , there is little conclusive evidence to support the assertion and for all the noise that has sometimes been stirred up over caffeine addiction and children , the fda despite pressure from health groups has never acted on petitions to require manufacturers to list the amount of caffeine their drinks contain code red is an extension of mountain dew , a highcaffeine soda that is marketed mostly to young people over the last decade , dew , as the company fondly refers to it , has proved to be one of the industry s fastestgrowing brands , propelled by an image that is almost as frenzied as the pace of its sales the selfdescribed drink of choice among thrillseekers and adrenaline addicts , mountain dew has continued to grow despite the soda slowdown , though not by much whether the excitement it generates among teenagers is physiological or the outcome of expert marketing , more than a billion gallons are consumed every year , more than twice the amount 10 years ago with code red , pepsi would like nothing better than a repeat performance to get it , the company is retooling its marketing techniques to tap the consumer base that it missed the first time blacks , hispanics and other minorities for years , the prototypical mountain dew drinker has looked remarkably similar to the dew dudes featured in the beverage s television commercials they are young teenage boys , heavily into sports like skateboarding or snowboarding , who generally live in the suburbs or rural areas and they are primarily white not exclusively , the company says , but disproportionately so
mount sinai , ny , jan 5 the arson committed at the upscale subdivision being built on old farmland here , just off route 25a in eastern long island , will never serve as a sophisticated model for the crime the fires that torched three nearly completed houses were all ignited by birthday candles that had been attached to the handles of plastic jugs filled with gasoline and the messages spraypainted on another house in the subdivision that snowy , dec 30 morning did not seem particularly auspicious either elf stop urban sprawl if you build it we will burn it and , finally , burn the rich but if the elf acronym is mostly unfamiliar on the east coast , it has long been a reference point in the pacific northwest for illegal and extreme environmental activism that law enforcement officials call ecoterrorism it stands for earth liberation front , a movement structured so loosely that trying to get a handle on it is like trying to grab a fistful of water for several years the people who claim allegiance to the group elf and its partner in activism , the animal liberation front , have taken responsibility for an underground campaign of destruction and fire against those they see as the earth s enemies lumber and construction industries , mink and fox farmers , bioengineering companies and laboratories that do tests on animals for elf and alf , they all represent base capitalism with a lanky vegan in portland , ore , acting as its publicist although he says he merely shares the information forwarded to him through means he declines to reveal the group boasts of what it considers to be nonviolent destruction , and provides a running cost estimate of the damage wrought , now at nearly 37 million that total includes the 80 , 000 in damage done in mount sinai , and some bigticket destruction as well , including the 12 million arson at a new ski resort in vail , colo , in 1998 , and the 1 million arson at a lumber company s office in monmouth , ore , in 1999 although elf has taken credit for acts of destruction elsewhere in the country , from the burning of a luxury home on the lip of a national forest in indiana to the sabotage of a highway construction site in louisiana , it has largely been associated with the west but the mount sinai fires , along with several smaller fires last month and the uprooting of a cornfield at the cold spring harbor laboratory last summer , have brought its message and notoriety to the quickly vanishing farmlands of long island and to the media market of new york the day after the mount sinai fires , elf issued a news release that included a local angle it said the arson , for which it took full responsibility , was partly done to show support for andrew stepanian , an animalrights activist from the affluent long island community of lloyd neck mr stepanian was recently convicted of throwing a brick through the display windows of a fur store in huntington this morning , just before he was sentenced to 90 days in jail in suffolk county court in riverhead , mr stepanian and about two dozen supporters stood outside the courtroom and expressed admiration for the ideology of elf they repeated the group s slogans and railed against urban sprawl , but none admitted to being an elf , as elf members like to refer to themselves i think what they did is a wonderful thing , said mr stepanian , 22 but , he added , we have no idea who they are neither , it seems , do the federal bureau of investigation , the united states forest service or any of the other federal , state and local law enforcement agencies that have tried for several years to stop the movement and arrest the masterminds that is , if there are masterminds absolutely , there s frustration , said kevin favreau , the fbi s domesticterrorism supervisor in portland , which comes as close as anyplace to being the base of the amorphous group but people always said the fbi would n't infiltrate the mafia , and we did they said we would n't infiltrate the kgb , and we did is it harder than your average criminal group \? yes , it is it s not a group you can put your fingers on then again , he added , maybe law enforcement will start getting lucky but craig rosebraugh , the publicist in portland , said he doubted that would happen there s no central leadership where they can go and knock off the top guy and it will be defunct , he said it operates on an ideology he described the movement as a series of cells across the country with no chain of command and no membership roll , a structure that supporters liken to that of the french resistance and the african national congress there is only a shared philosophy , he said , in taking aim at anyone who is destroying the environment for the sake of profit because he is the spokesman for elf , mr rosebraugh s pale , bespectacled face is the only one attached to the movement , even though he says he is a supporter but not a member as a result , federal officials have raided his home , seized his computer and placed him before a grand jury investigating elf and alf activities simply put , they want to know the identities of those who keep him abreast of what elf is doing , and the means by which they do so
three weeks after they voted to eliminate two teams for next season , baseball s club owners will convene again tuesday in chicago to hear a status report on the contraction plan while they are there , the owners will be asked to act on another matter the election of commissioner bud selig to a second term no formal agenda has been sent to the clubs , but two officials said yesterday that they had been told a second term for selig would be proposed when sandy alderson , executive vice president for baseball operations , and a likely candidate for future commissioner , was asked about the plan , he said , that s something you ought to discuss with the commissioner the commissioner did not return a telephone call yesterday selig , 67 , has nearly two years remaining in his first fiveyear term he was elected commissioner july 9 , 1998 , and his term began aug 1 of that year he had served nearly six years as acting commissioner if the owners approve him for a second term and it is virtually certain that they will selig will become the first commissioner to serve more than one term since bowie kuhn , who served from 1969 to 1984 peter ueberroth , who succeeded kuhn , chose not to run for a second term a bartlett giamatti died in office , and fay vincent resigned under pressure from a group of owners led by selig , who was then the president of the milwaukee brewers , and jerry reinsdorf of the chicago white sox selig , as chairman of the executive council , became the acting commissioner and held the position through one aborted commissioner search until he was elected in 1998 selig s election to a second term would come as baseball is mired in a contraction effort that has become messy and confusing challenges in court and before an arbitrator have delayed the process some teams remain uncertain about their future existence and others face their offseason planning with uncertainty players , too , are not sure what to expect the freeagent market , except for perhaps the top tier of players , is expected to be affected by the questions surrounding contraction i think the commissioner believes contraction continues to be a viable option to pursue , alderson said nothing is easy nothing is totally predictable i do n't think there s anything surprising that has developed over the last several weeks it does n't mean there are n't issues that have to be dealt with dec 15 has been mentioned as the date when the clubs want to hold a dispersal draft of the players on the teams that will be eliminated those teams have not been identified , but they are expected to be the montreal expos and the minnesota twins i do n't think that date has ever been precisely defined , alderson said none of this stuff is an absolute necessity on any particular date a number of dates are important yesterday , 40man rosters had to be submitted there are several other dates that culminate with dec 20 , the contract tender date as each of those dates passes , issues arise , but nothing is insurmountable is there a point after which contraction for the 2002 season would become impossible \? i 'd say that s probably true , alderson said i 'd start with opening day and work my way back i'm not sure where you draw the line
brussels , nov 5 microsoft is no nearer to resolving its antitrust problems in europe than it was before friday s proposed settlement with the united states justice department , a spokeswoman at the european commission here said today we will be studying the settlement with interest , but we ca n't say what implications it will have on the european antitrust case yet , said the commission s competition spokeswoman , amelia torres the european case against microsoft is legally and factually different from the case in the united states , ms torres said our investigation continues and is at an early stage at the end of august , the european commission , the daytoday executive agency of the european union , combined two separate antitrust investigations of microsoft s windows operating systems , and added new accusations that by bundling its windows media player music and video streaming software with windows 2000 , the company was again abusing a dominant market position microsoft will make a written response to the enlarged european case in the coming days , and is expected to request a hearing with european union competition regulators on dec 20 or 21 microsoft s president and chief executive , steven a ballmer , said at a news conference on friday that he wanted to reach a settlement in the european case , too we 're engaged in a process with the european commission and as we have wanted to settle this matter , mr ballmer said of the case in the united states , so would we like to appropriately settle the matter with the european commission his comments appeared to signal a change in microsoft s approach two months ago , john frank , the company s senior corporate lawyer in europe , said microsoft is not contemplating settlement discussions at this time mr frank was not available to comment on monday ms torres said that the commission did not expect microsoft to volunteer to address all its concerns , adding , though if they got back and said they want to sort this out , we would be delighted but you 'd expect them to dispute at least some of the commission s objections the european authorities said in august that microsoft might have violated their antitrust rules by using illegal practices to extend its dominant position in the market for personal computer operating systems into the market for lowend server operating systems lowend , or work group servers , are used by corporate departments or small businesses to connect pc s with shared printers , shared files and web servers microsoft has amassed almost 60 percent of this market , according to the computer and communications industry association , an industry group based in washington its rivals there include sun microsystems , novell and the linux operating system , but none has a market share anywhere approaching microsoft s the addition of the bundling accusation involving media player to the european case bears a resemblance to the charges originally brought by the justice department that microsoft bundled its internet explorer web browser illegally with the windows system but a european union official , who spoke in exchange for anonymity , said there has been no cooperation between the authorities in the united states and in europe in merger rulings there is closer cooperation , the official said , but with antitrust , there are limits to the amount of cooperation in 1994 , the european commission and the justice department jointly forced microsoft to abandon its licensing agreements with personal computer makers that had forced them to pay a royalty on every pc , whether or not it had microsoft software preinstalled the european commission hailed the outcome then as a model of how to tackle giant companies there is less common ground between the competition regulators this time , the official said , adding , there is less overlap in the cases and there seems to be a greater distance between the regulators themselves than there was in 1994
money bundled in large chunks by prominent city lawyers , business executives and bankers is continuing to pour into comptroller alan g hevesi s campaign at a rate that far exceeds those of his democratic rivals for mayor at the same time , mr hevesi has sent back far more donations than his opponents have , money that for the most part was gathered by intermediaries but returned over the last six months after ethical questions were raised about the contributions the details about refunds and giving by socalled bundlers turns up in the thousands of pages of campaign finance reports filed by all the candidates monday the reports also show that the city s real estate industry is , as planned , hedging its bets in the mayor s race by spreading dollars among the candidates , with the president of the real estate board of new york alone delivering nearly 450 , 000 , a record in city politics the campaign finance data also illustrates just how competitive many of the citywide races are this year candidates vying for public advocate and comptroller are raising unusually large amounts of money , ensuring that these battles for the democratic nominations will be intense mr hevesi was not the biggest fundraiser during the last six months public advocate mark green earned that title , taking in a total of 17 million since midjanuary , compared with mr hevesi s 12 million but the comptroller collected 37 cents of every dollar from intermediaries , while mr green s records show that he took in just 10 cents on the dollar in such batches the fundraising practice in which an individual collects money from friends , business associates and others and delivers it to a candidate is legal ambiguities in how the law defines an intermediary means the actual totals per candidate may not reflect all the fundraising on their behalf for instance , a person who solicits a contribution but does not actually deliver it need not be counted as a bundler furthermore , one provision allows some people to register as fundraising agents , meaning they do not have to record what they bring in mr green s brother stephen green , a prominent real estate executive , plays such a role but still , campaign finance watchdog groups have criticized the use of intermediaries , saying that it offers a way for individuals to legally circumvent the 4 , 500 donation limit per candidate the single biggest intermediary remains steven spinola , president of the real estate board as an individual , he has not given a dollar to any mayoral candidate this year , according to city records but he has arranged for the delivery of 448 , 295 so far through a total of 188 donations to city council speaker peter f vallone , mr green and fernando ferrer , the bronx borough president , with mr vallone taking in by far the most it is like when a candidate goes to a union looking for it to deliver voters or workers , said mr spinola , noting that what the real estate executives can offer , by and large , is money none of his collected donations have gone to mr hevesi , who rebuffed the board s offers to raise more money for him but mr spinola said that was largely because the comptroller had received so many donations before this year from real estate executives that many had already hit the 4 , 500 limit the real estate executive richard ruben , for example , has delivered 29 , 600 on his own to mr hevesi in the last six months , while william traylor , a real estate developer , delivered an additional 16 , 100 to the comptroller since january the list of prominent bundlers includes some major city contractors , like lawrence roman , president of wdf greene , a mount vernon , ny , company mr roman said he is paid tens of millions of dollars to build city schools mr roman , who delivered 20 , 500 to mr hevesi during this cycle , said he supported the comptroller because he has aggressively tried to prevent wdf s competitors from getting an edge by underpaying their employees he said he expected nothing in return for the donations , but would prefer that the entire practice of lining up donations be banned i would rather bring in votes , he said but the politicians tell me they do n't want votes they need money to spend on radio and television among the other top bundlers so far this year include louis jimenez , chief executive of montauk credit union , who delivered about 20 , 000 each for mr hevesi and mr ferrer , and angelo silveri , president of the silverite construction company , who delivered 20 , 000 to mr vallone mr hevesi also received some bundled contributions from asianamerican businessmen , including 25 , 950 raised by jimmy meng , owner of the queens lumber company , and 15 , 500 raised by howard li , the chief executive of waitex , a manhattanbased warehouse and distribution company when previous fundraising is added , mr meng has raised a total of 177 , 650 for mr hevesi s mayoral campaign , making mr meng one of the comptroller s biggest fundraisers the four democratic mayoral candidates over the last six months sent back 354 contributions , worth a total of 433 , 762 mr hevesi alone returned slightly more than half of that money in some cases , it was merely because individuals contributed more than the 4 , 500 limit but often it was related to controversy nearly 60 , 000 worth of donations delivered by peter ditommaso , a new jersey contractor linked by city officials to the mob , was sent back by mr hevesi the candidates at times returned money without any public notice of the controversial nature of the donations mr green , for example , gave back about 16 , 000 in may that had been donated by employees of c d restoration , a brooklyn contractor convicted in september of violating state antitrust laws as part of an investigation into bidrigging by the manhattan district attorney s office illustrating just how competitive the elections are this year from the mayor on down the candidates for public advocate and comptroller had already raised more money as of midjuly than was raised in the entire election cycle for those races in 1997 city councilman herbert e berman has the lead in the comptroller s race , taking in a total of 136 million since the start of this campaign cycle in 1998 , compared with william c thompson jr , the former board of education chairman , who has collected 104 million in the race for public advocate , betsy gotbaum , the former parks commissioner , has raised 112 million , compared with 905 , 204 for assemblyman scott m stringer 606 , 803 for city councilman stephen dibrienza 466 , 348 for city councilwoman kathryn e freed and 377 , 415 for norman siegel , the civil liberties lawyer many of these candidates have benefited from contributions raised by bundlers as well mr siegel , for example , has received more than 100 , 000 collected by david geffen , the entertainment industry executive , with chunks of that money coming from edward norton , whoopi goldberg and barbra streisand , the actors mel brooks larry gagosian , the art dealer the movie executive jeffrey katzenberg steven spielberg jack valenti , the movie industry trade executive and martin peretz and jann s wenner , the magazine executives chart ledger mayoral campaign financing all four democratic mayoral candidates have benefited from donation bundlers , those who collect money from a group of contributors and deliver it to a candidate figures are from jan 12 through july 11 ferrer total collected 625 , 734 portion from donations

the white house has asked us networks to limit broadcasts of statements by osama bin laden i wish that instead of censorship , the president would respond to him here s what mr bush could say dear bin laden i 've listened to the statement you released through al jazeera tv since i know that no arab or muslim leader will dare answer you , i thought i would do it let me be blunt your statement was pathetic it s obvious from what you said that you do n't have a clue why we 're so strong or why the arab regimes you despise are so weak you spoke about the suicide attacks on us as being just revenge for the 80 years of humiliation and disgrace the islamic nation has gone through you referred to the hijackers as a muslim vanguard sent to destroy america , the leader of the international infidels , and you denounced the arab regimes as hypocrites and hereditary rulers what was most revealing , though , was what you did n't say you offered no vision of the future this was probably your last will and testament i sure hope so and you could have said anything you wanted to future generations after all , it was your mike yet you had nothing to say your only message to the muslim world was whom to hate , not what to build let alone how in part it s because you really do n't know much about islamic history the muslim world reached the zenith of its influence in the middle ages when it preserved the best of classical greek and roman teachings , and inspired breakthroughs in mathematics , science , medicine and philosophy that is also when islam was at its most open to the world , when it enriched , and was enriched by , the christian , greek and jewish communities in its midst whom you now disparage as infidels and when it was actively trading with all corners of the world your closed , inward , hatefilled version of islam which treats women as cattle and all nonmuslims as enemies corresponds with no period of greatness for islam , and will bring none it was also revealing that the only arab state you mentioned was iraq interesting iraq is led by a fascist dictator , saddam hussein , who used poison gas against his own people , who squandered iraq s oil wealth to build himself palaces and who raped kuwait but you are silent about all that what bothers you is our targeted sanctions to end such a regime not the regime itself in other words , you not only do n't understand the muslim past , you do n't understand its present the reason these past 80 years have been so stagnant for the arabmuslim world is not because we in america have been trying to keep you down actualy , we have n't been thinking about you much at all no , the difference between american power , chinese power , latin american power and arabmuslim power today is what we 've each been doing for these past 80 years we and others have been trying to answer many questions how do we best educate our kids \? how do we increase our trade \? how do we build an industrial base \? how do we increase political participation \? and we judged our leaders on how well they answered all those questions but people like you want arabs and muslims to ask only one question of their leaders how well did you fight the infidels and israelis \? i know that who rules jerusalem is a deeply important part of your heritage , and every arabmuslim leader must address it but it ca n't be the only question yet , because people like you have reduced it to the only question , and tried to intimidate every arab who wanted to ask other questions , you have allowed your region to be led by scoundrels , like saddam yes , you 've wreaked some havoc , bin laden , but do n't flatter yourself into thinking you can destroy us you have to build something strong to destroy something strong but you ca n't because all the intellectual and creative energies in the arabmuslim world which are as bountiful as in any other region can never reach their full potential under repressive regimes like iraq or leaders like yourself stalin and mao killed a lot of their own people , but even these thugs had a plan for their societies you , bin laden , are nothing but a hijacker a hijacker of islam , a hijacker of other people s technology , a hijacker of a vast arab nation s anger at its own regimes but you have no vision and no plan for your people which is why your epitaph will be easy to write osama bin laden he destroyed much , he built nothing his lasting impact was like a footprint in the desert
washington gazing into the open texas sky eight years ago , saleem tawil had an epiphany that could revolutionize how many americans get their television signals and how much they pay for them mr tawil observed that a porch light behind him did not obscure the twinkling stars overhead from this , he reckoned that a transmitter on the ground need not drown out the signal from a satellite that was broadcasting on the same frequency if he is right , twice as many paytv services could use the same sliver of the electromagnetic spectrum , a highly limited resource that comprises all radio and television frequencies his insight was to transmit the signals from different directions all broadcast satellites orbit over the equator , pacing the earth s rotation so that they appear stationary from the ground for that reason , all consumer dishes in america point in a southerly direction if mr tawil s reasoning proves correct , small transmitters on towers could offer a competing and far cheaper service by beaming signals on the same frequencies from the north of their intended subscribers signals travel in a straight line , so those from towers have a limited range on the curved surface of the earth but that smaller range would make it easier to offer the local programming that has eluded satellite services , which by their nature broadcast to huge areas and because such a system would not require launching satellites or laying cable , it could be offered at a fraction of what is being charged by direct broadcast satellite and cable television services , in rural as well as urban areas a method for doubling the capacity of even a small part of the broadcast spectrum is potentially a multibilliondollar idea as the information age has come into its own through remarkable advances in technology , spectrum licenses which grant the right to use radio frequencies have become washington s new industrial battleground the spectrum has quickly turned into the technological equivalent of jerusalem an overcrowded and highly desirable piece of real estate that the existing tenants and outsiders have had a difficult time sharing with little open space on the airwaves , licenses are extremely valuable wireless phone companies have hired legions of lobbyists and lawyers to persuade the government to find space to let handheld devices like cell phones and palm pilots browse the internet at faster speeds the defense department , broadcasters and others who have licenses are working just as furiously to keep them an obvious but elusive solution would be to find more efficient ways to use what is available , as mr tawil concluded an electrical engineer who once worked for the strategic air command program that maintains communications links with the nation s nuclear forces , mr tawil instantly appreciated the implication of his idea i was so excited , i could n't sleep for a week , he recalled joined by his wife , carmen , who is also an engineer , he enlisted a band of wealthy , politically tied investors and executives including sophia collier , who made a fortune developing soho sodas katherine reynolds , an heir to the texas family that owns king ranch , a spread larger than rhode island and antoinette cook bush , a former senior counsel to the senate subcommittee that oversees the federal communications commission and a stepdaughter of vernon e jordan jr then mr tawil received some patents for the technology and formed a company , northpoint technology , to go into the paytv business \( it is not related to northpoint communications , a bankrupt internet service provider \) now it appears that the nation s largest telecommunications and industrial companies are the ones losing sleep what is keeping them awake is northpoint s request to the federal communications commission to share frequencies with satellite broadcasters like directv and the echostar communications corporation an attempt to become the southwest airlines of the subscription television business its plea to federal regulators , which began in 1994 and entered a new phase last week with a final round of comments before the government hands down its final decision , has prompted an expensive lobbying and regulatory fight between northpoint and the satellite and cable television industries seeking to keep their market , those industries contend that northpoint s technology will interfere with their services the tussle poses fundamental policy questions over the role of the government in promoting competition among the many battles over bandwidth that have captivated washington s lobbyists and policy makers , the northpoint fight is particularly notable the company has spent more than 10 million in lobbying and legal costs , and its opponents have spent considerably more both sides have raised large sums for campaign contributions in an effort to influence important lawmakers each side claims the high moral ground of offering new services to underserved rural areas each offers important possible alternatives to highspeed internet services now dominated by telephone and cable companies each brandishes expensive test studies northpoint says its tests show that it can offer service without interfering with satellite services , while its critics offer data to demonstrate that this is technically impossible

it might not be safe to say there are countless web sites devoted to showing short films , but i would n't want to be the one charged with tallying them yet of all the shorts designed to give filmmakers a chance to show their stuff , none are quite as puzzling as the hire , the series of minidramas commissioned by bmw and currently running on bmwfilmscom the internet offers cachet as well as freedom from constraints that affect broadcast television , but it s hardly the best place to show minimovies by master filmmakers the independent film channel plans to add the shorts to its rotation eventually but for now , there s only the tease seen in television commercials that beckon us to the web site , offering something maybe never seen before , a trailer of a short it s not unlike breaking a chiclet in half the hire shorts made by john frankenheimer \( ronin \) , wong karwai \( in the mood for love \) , ang lee \( crouching tiger , hidden dragon \) , guy ritchie \( snatch \) and alejandro gonz lez i rritu \( amores perros \) feature clive owen , who is familiar to fans of the pbs mystery second sight as detective chief inspector ross tanner the british actor zoomed to fame last year with restrained star power in mike hodges s canny noir film croupier in a manner close in tone to several of bmw s poshest young models also featured in the hire series the shorts are startlingly effective bmw was touched by an angle to position the web spots as not just commercials the automaker understood the importance of burning the seal of credibility onto hire by asking wellknown directors to bring their own particular you might even say peculiar feelings about cars to film , hire becomes a marriage of commerce and creativity , straddling the everdwindling line between art and merchandising and by using directors of this caliber , bmw , the makers of what they call the ultimate driving machine , want the notice of customers attracted to film art and directors not generally attracted to making commercials filmmakers with arthouse luster can be counted on to accomplish something all companies desire relieve a customer of the necessity of making a decision about their product if talents like mr wong and mr lee , in addition to mr frankenheimer and mr ritchie , are a part of this campaign , bmw must be in touch with something i need to be a part of \( perhaps in the next series of internet films , bmw can bring in the director albert brooks , who has probably used luxury cars in his films as often as an automotive nut like mr frankenheimer mr brooks s riff about the 3series bmw convertible in defending your life should guarantee him a spot \) these little pictures in the hire series are not only signature pieces for their directors they are also very effective on the medium for which they were created the intimacy of the internet demands a heightened attention , if only because you may have to stare intently to see exactly what s going on having a digital internet connection or a t1 line does n't hurt and there are the technical problems with streaming video , which can add unanticipated tension in viewing climaxes because the films can often stutter and stall before playing out to their conclusions , an unfortunate predicament given that the series is about , well , cars , specifically bmw s \( logos of the other vehicles are obscured \) after an initial run on the web site , bmwfilmscom , the spots directed by mr frankenheimer and mr lee were screened at the cannes film festival last month mr wong s short was first screened at this event \( the most recent release , directed by mr ritchie , had its premiere recently on the web site , and mr gonz lez i rritu is still completing his film \) at cannes , the hire briefs seemed to underwhelm the crowd , perhaps because a letdown was inevitable after the excitement generated by the directors' names the assembled were surprised that the films were commercials the bmw films tingle with zest in a way that car ads do n't anymore it s the tingle that most of us get to experience only when poring over car and driver , reading about skidpad performance you can feel the filmmakers' pleasure , probably bmw s , at not having to brand the shorts with those mincing do n't try these stunts at home disclaimers that seem to be found even in shampoo ads these days even mr wong s moody spot has a callused machismo missing from smallscreen auto ads , instead of his usual sinuous narrative style that questions traditional gender roles \( perhaps this burly chauvinism explains bmw s shortsightedness not a single one of the spots is directed by a woman are there no women on the autobahn \?

oil prices , which have plunged in the last three weeks , are not expected to rise significantly in the wake of the initial united states strike against afghanistan , analysts said yesterday in the past , wars in the middle east ignited fears about a disruption in the supply of oil from the region , which in turn led to sharp increases in prices although afghanistan is far from the persian gulf , some oil traders and others were concerned immediately after the sept 11 attacks on the united states that any retaliation might prompt the muslim countries of the middle east to curtail oil shipments to the west but saudi arabia and other members of the organization of the petroleum exporting countries have pledged to keep supplies stable , which helped to ease anxiety in the markets because of falling demand for oil in the sluggish global economy , prices have dropped about 20 percent since sept 11 oil industry analysts and traders said prices might rise when the markets open today , anywhere from a few cents to a dollar or two , but none expected prices to stay high in new york , oil for november delivery closed friday at 2239 a barrel we had a small runup at the end of last week in anticipation of any retaliation , said john kilduff , senior vice president of energy risk management at fimat , the commodities trading arm of soci t g n rale i would expect a mild rise when the markets open if the attacks remain limited to the asian subcontinent , this wo n't be too much of a problem for the markets analysts said they expected that the markets might react to another , far less important event on saturday , a bomb exploded in a busy mall in khobar , saudi arabia , killing two people , including an american man no one took immediate responsibility for the attack , and saudi officials were quick to play down a possible connection between the incident and the expected united states offensive in afghanistan but some industry experts said the saturday attack might be a hint of the growing restiveness in muslim countries as their leaders side with the west against afghanistan and osama bin laden the united states has so far been careful to make sure that its campaign against bin laden does not destabilize regimes in oilproducing countries aligned with it overthrowing the ruling royal family in saudi arabia and purging the country of the several thousand american troops stationed there has long been one of mr bin laden s stated goals nervousness could rise in the oil markets if the united states strikes against afghanistan lead to widespread protest in the middle east or more terrorist attacks in oilproducing countries the market might be afraid of what could happen next , said leonidas p drollas , chief economist with the center for global energy studies in london
los angeles , nov 14 ghaith aljazzar recognized them immediately seated at a picnic table in a sea of college students chatting between classes today , the two men in suits and dark glasses were plainly federal bureau of investigation agents , even before they flashed their badges mr aljazzar , a 21yearold student from syria , suppressed his anxiety and sat down the morning before , fbi agents had gone to his home , telling his mother that they wanted to ask him some questions but what about \? he had spoken at a peace rally a few days earlier could that be it \? i did n't know what to expect , said mr aljazzar , president of the muslim student union at the university of california at irvine as the agents asked him about the political leanings of his group and the extent of antiamerican sentiment on campus , he relaxed a bit , comfortable that he was not a suspect but after the interview , with the agents reminding him to call if he heard of any terrorist plots , mr aljazzar said he wondered if the meeting had been worth all the apprehension it had produced if i knew something crazy was going to happen , he said , i would have called them anyway they did n't need to contact me polite and informal though they may be , the fbi s interviews with 5 , 000 young men in the united states on tourist , student or business visas have sent waves of worry across campuses , mosques and community organizations in southern california muslims are asking who will be next there is a great deal of fear , said mahmoud abdelbaset , the religious director of the islamic center of southern california many of us came from police states , where people can be detained for no good reason we are used to not trusting the government , and i do n't think the attorney general s tone or his words are reassuring anybody local bureau officials met with arab american and muslim groups recently , reminding residents that they are not necessarily suspects if they are called in for questioning but at the same meetings , officials said that they have tens of thousands of tips to pursue in southern california alone that means the whole community is being investigated , said michel shehadeh , the west coast director of the arab american antidiscrimination committee the apprehension is perhaps most palpable at universities , where many foreign students wonder if the political or social activities that once raised their status on campus are federal agents' attention bilal khan , president of the muslim student association at the university for california at los angeles , said that several members had been questioned by bureau agents none have been arrested or detained , mr khan said , but they are irritated , especially because the group s main focus is tutoring high school students and pulling together free health clinics in poor neighborhoods people here are asking , 'why us , when all we 're trying to do is give back to the community \? ' mr khan said but there s no real answer , other than the arabic names , and that s why the people here are panicked some professors said they were worried that the interviews would hasten the exodus of students who have not already left the united states at the behest of their families richard h dekmejian , a professor of middle eastern politics at the university of southern california , said the stigma of being questioned by law enforcement officials was pervasive among muslims from abroad , making it difficult for his students to see the interviews as anything but an indication of suspicion we try to comfort them as much as possible , professor dekmejian said for many residents , the prospect of being questioned seems considerably more harrowing than the interviews themselves for three weeks , bureau agents have been leaving messages for haitham aranki , a 43yearold palestinian who makes springs for garage doors and car suspensions , informing him that they want to question him mr aranki has been trying to set up a meeting , but to no avail i'm left with this feeling of not knowing what they want from me , mr aranki said , if i'm being watched , if they 'll come to my house and tell my daughters that the fbi wants to talk to me you stay in a very emotional state , not knowing what s going on photo bilal khan , president of a muslim student association in california , said fbi agents had questioned several members of the group \( gerard burkhart for the new york times \) \( pg b10 \)

the dupont company , seeking to move assets out of slowgrowth businesses , said yesterday that it would cut 4 , 000 jobs , or about 4 percent of its work force , as well as 1 , 300 contract workers about half of the cuts will come in dupont s nylon and polyester businesses , and about 3 , 000 of the jobs will be eliminated in the united states dupont said the action would save 400 million a year the cuts did not surprise analysts the bad economy and the high cost of oil and gas and transportation have put a lot of chemical companies between a rock and a hard place , said david kerans , an analyst at argus research gary m pfeiffer , dupont s chief financial officer , said that the cuts would have been made even if the economy had continued to boom this is about positioning ourselves for sustainable growth , he said as targets for growth , mr pfeiffer cited farm products like seeds and soy proteins services like safety consulting , and computer products like flatpanel displays analysts say that dupont , which is based in wilmington , del , also is doing well with lycra fibers , corian countertops , stainmaster carpet fibers and tyvek construction materials dupont has lots of wonderful brands , but it s struggling with its longerterm business vision , said alexander a hittle , an analyst at a g edwards sons investors bid up dupont s shares 26 cents , to 4096 , as the dow industrials fell more than 1 percent this was just one more data point that shows dupont moving away from slowgrowth businesses , said gene pisasale , senior investment officer for wilmington trust company , a major investor in dupont analysts are split about dupont s prospects thomson financial first call said that seven analysts recommend dupont stock , while five discourage investors from buying it none of the analysts changed their recommendations yesterday in searching for growth industries , dupont , whose formal name is ei du pont de nemours company , is the latest chemical company to walk away from the idea of a life sciences industry under that concept , biotechnology would be a bridge between agricultural and pharmaceuticals products , with chemical companies active in both areas the concept turned out to be unworkable while the science in the two areas was similar , the end markets were too different it was like saying the same companies should make cars and airplanes because both use steel and engineers , said sergey vasnetsov , an analyst at lehman brothers monsanto , novartis and aventis all have spun off their pharmaceutical arms in december , dupont said that it , too , was looking to sell its pharmaceutical business with drugs out of the spotlight , dupont is reorganizing agricultural sales so that farmers looking for pesticides , feed or seed need to deal with only one representative and dupont continues to apply biotechnology research to chemicals it recently introduced a fiber made out of farm waste products like corn husks while few analysts argue with dupont s strategy , several are impatient with its tactics the company will take a charge of 40 to 45 cents a share against secondquarter earnings mr vasnetsov notes that between 1993 and 1999 , onetime charges accounted for about 18 percent of reported earnings for dupont , nearly twice the rate of other chemical companies they 're like a perennial dieter , they 'll shed a few pounds , become complacent , then go through liposuction again , mr vasnetsov said mr pfeiffer shrugged off the criticism dupont is a grand old mansion that is undergoing massive renovation , he said , and that has to bring restructuring charges
shortly after she arrived at hewlettpackard two years ago , carleton s fiorina invited the heirs of the founders over one afternoon it was a pleasant couple of hours of talk over drinks , just a social gettogether the family members appreciated the gesture from the outsider who had come to take charge at the company that has their names on the door when she first became chief executive , one family member recalled , she made a real effort to meet and get to know the family ms fiorina , the nation s most prominent woman executive , understood the legacy of hewlettpackard it is regarded as the entrepreneurial birthplace of silicon valley , founded in 1938 in a garage in palo alto , calif , by william hewlett and david packard with 538 her job was to revitalize a corporate icon , one with a rich past yet an uncertain future , sluggish and slipping behind in crucial computing markets the renovation task , however , would be particularly delicate , because the founders' heirs control a total of about 18 percent of hewlettpackard shares now , the heirs have united to stop her they fear that ms fiorina s plans for hewlettpackard s future are too risky for them to stomach last friday , the packard family delivered the most severe blow yet to ms fiorina , her plans for the company and her career the david and lucile packard foundation , the company s largest shareholder , declared it would vote against hewlettpackard s acquisition of compaq computer the packard foundation has joined walter hewlett and david woodley packard , the two oldest sons of the founders , who last month said they and their foundations would vote against the deal facing unified opposition from the families , the largest merger in computer history is in danger of a humbling rebuff to rescue the deal , ms fiorina and her company must win the backing of major investors who have been skeptical so far page c1 if the deal collapses as many analysts predict ms fiorina , who has championed it as the bold step hewlettpackard needs to become more competitive , will likely depart in a lengthy interview last week at the company s palo alto headquarters , ms fiorina , 47 , stopped just short of confirming that if the shareholders take the unusual step of vetoing the deal , she said , it would say a lot about the board and management s credibility in the interview , her first since the initial family opposition arose in early november , ms fiorina defended the deal and her tenure at hewlettpackard the interview came before the packard foundation vote on friday , but afterward she and the board said they would press ahead she expressed confidence that they could still garner enough votes to have the merger approved it s going to go through , she said it will the interview was in her secondfloor office a kind of firstamongequals version of the classic silicon valley cubicle , a large corner space marked off by beige , shoulderhigh partitions her manner was direct , often combative , her handshake firm she never criticized the families directly , but a theme of her comments was that her program of change is truer to the founders' vision than the stance of her opponents this company has never been about looking in the rearview mirror , though some people are more comfortable doing it , ms fiorina said at one point later , she declared , to say that the status quo is a strategy is absurd it s never been a strategy in this industry the compaq merger has been controversial since it was announced on sept 4 the immediate reaction from wall street was skeptical , as investors drove down the shares of both companies the skepticism is understandable big mergers in the fastmoving computer business have a poor track record corporate cultures clash , and integrating the operations of two big enterprises often turns out to be a timeconsuming distraction while the merging companies dither , markets and rivals move on a big merger would also be a striking departure from tradition at hewlettpackard , a company that has grown organically and nurtured a closeknit culture emphasizing trust , openness and consensus , known as the hp way such concerns fueled the family opposition to the deal , led by walter hewlett , the one family member who is a company director ms fiorina sees things very differently based on her two years as chief executive , she is convinced that the company needs more than a strategy of evolution from within she has worked hard to modernize the company s culture leadership , she says , is a performance art change has to be led from the top , she said people have to understand what you are trying to do and buy it a determined , energetic performer , ms fiorina traveled 250 , 000 miles in her first year to company facilities worldwide , urging employees to quicken the pace she reorganized to shear away layers of bureaucracy and she engineered a new marketing campaign with a simplified hp logo , dropping the family names
the bergen county prosecutor said yesterday that he would seek to dismiss charges against a former employee of a health spa in lodi , nj , that was the target of a prostitution raid last week , after determining that the charges were fabricated by federal officials to protect the spa s owner the prosecutor , william h schmidt , also said he would seek a similar dismissal in the case of a lodi police officer charged with assaulting the spa s owner he added that his office was intensifying an investigation into why the lodi department was pressured by federal authorities to file the charges mr schmidt said he would appear today before judge sybil r moses in state superior court in hackensack to ask that the case be dismissed my job is not just to prosecute , mr schmidt said in an interview my job is to see that justice is done , which includes the vindication of individuals who are innocent the case began in november 1999 , when the former employee , millie nevin , went to the lodi police department after quitting her job at the ultima spa , which advertises nude massage , to report that prostitution was occurring there mr schmidt and ms nevin s lawyer , albert carilli , said she was later visited at her home in new jersey by two fbi agents from the agency s newark office , which mr schmidt said had been conducting a joint investigation of the lodi police department with his office he and mr carilli said ms nevin recognized one of the agents from seeing him at the spa mr schmidt said an fbi agent , in consultation with an assistant united states attorney in newark , then urged the lodi police to charge ms nevin with filing a false report he said the intention was to protect the owner of the spa , who apparently had been acting as an fbi informant the charge against the police officer , lt vincent caruso , involves an allegation that in the spring of 1998 , he put a gun inside the mouth of luke hoffman , the spa s owner lieutenant caruso s lawyer , robert galantucci , said on wednesday that his client was innocent , and that the charge against his client was fabricated mr schmidt said he notified the fbi and the united states attorney s office that he was concerned about the complaint against ms nevin more than a year ago , and that he was disappointed that the agencies had taken no action a spokeswoman for the fbi , sandra carroll , said that the incident has been referred to the justice department s office of professional responsibility , and that a review is pending the united states attorney for new jersey , robert j cleary , released a statement yesterday denying the allegations as inaccurate and unfounded mr cleary said he was nonetheless referring the matter to the justice department office investigators from mr schmidt s office raided the spa on march 29 , and 14 workers , including mr hoffman , were arrested on charges of prostitution or promoting prostitution mr schmidt said the investigation and subsequent prostitution charges , which involve allegations of sex in hot tubs , satisfied him that ms nevin was , in fact , telling the truth mr schmidt said there were 21 police officers from several departments in hudson county inside the spa when it was raided , but none were engaged in illegal activity

after 11 days of intensive investigation , a collective portrait has begun to emerge of the men who guided three planes into the world trade center and the pentagon and crashed a fourth in an empty field in pennsylvania it is sketchy and incomplete , but its disparate pieces show a group of seemingly welleducated young men who slipped into the country and settled into bland suburban lives while they gained just enough training as pilots to take control of a passenger jet in midair while american officials have blamed osama bin laden for the attacks , they are still struggling to connect him directly to the plot investigators believe there were many more conspirators , but despite the efforts of thousands of law enforcement and intelligence agents , the authorities have arrested only a handful of suspects in the united states from interviews and confidential law enforcement documents , it appears that the hijackers lived at once secretly and in the open , taking advantage of the anonymity and freedom of a society they despised they arrived in the country alone or in pairs , using legitimate documents and sometimes false identities none were known to have had criminal records , and only two appear to have come to the attention of the cia the rest , intelligence officials would say , were clean they got post office boxes and email accounts , driver s licenses and atm cards although some of them spoke little english , they barely stood out in a landscape that has grown increasingly diverse the men stayed away from strangers and communicated discreetly among themselves , officials said , sometimes using prepaid cellular telephones and going online at public libraries midlevel drug dealers might have scoffed at their tradecraft , but their security was as effective as it was lowtech as secret agents , they were unpolished two of the suspected hijackers had their visa accounts blocked , forcing them to buy their plane tickets with cash at a crowded airport another was stopped for driving without a license and eventually had a warrant issued for his arrest in the end , though , there was a chilling focus to the madness that left thousands dead on sept 11 if the hijackers knew how their operation was to end , they managed to keep their resolve for months even as they strolled through malls , shopped for groceries and went to the gym they 'd just look right through you , recalled gail north , 41 , a longtime resident of the valencia motel in laurel , md , where five of the hijackers shared a single room the week before the attacks the terrorists left a spotty trail in laurel , an fbi document indicates , agents found a duffel bag containing pilot headsets and other aviation items another bag recovered at logan international airport in boston held a video about commercial aircraft and a will , one official said tracking the hijackers' finances , investigators have concluded that the operation probably did not cost much more than 200 , 000 the clues are everywhere at a pub in the german port city of hamburg , a patron recalls his conversations with the young arab men who sometimes gathered in the afternoons , to talk but not to drink they all hated america , the patron said , referring to the circle around mohamed atta , who is thought to have been one of the leaders of the plot it s no secret at the airman flight school in norman , okla , there is the record of an email message that arrived on march 22 , 2000 , from one matta could the school please send some information , the writer asked , about the accelerated program it had to train people as professional pilots \? and at a fitness center in fort lauderdale , fla , roxanne caputo remembers the reserved , pleasant young man with wirerimmed glasses who had a strangely consuming desire to learn kickboxing , street fighting and the martial arts he seemed a little tense , but that s not unusual , ms caputo said he got in and he got out intelligence officials believe that the planning for the attacks may well have gone back years , and roots of the conspiracy are visible on the dingy southern edge of hamburg it was there that mr atta , then a student at the technical university of hamburgharburg , began to grow more and more devout after making a pilgrimage to mecca in 1995 at the city planning firm where he worked as an intern , his former supervisors and colleagues recall that mr atta brought a prayer rug to the office and became very careful about what he ate , scraping the frosting from cakes lest they contain pork fat in 1999 , the year he completed his studies , mr atta organized an islamic prayer group through the university students' union german police officials now believe the group might have provided useful cover to recruit other students among mr atta s confederates was marwan alshehhi , a student from the united arab emirates another may have been the young man with wirerimmed glasses who later turned up in fort lauderdale ziad jarrahi , the son of a middleclass family in lebanon who studied aircraft design at hamburg s university of applied sciences
newark , feb 6 a federal investigation that began by looking into illegal contributions to robert g torricelli s senate campaign in 1996 is now focused in large part on mr torricelli himself , lawyers and others familiar with the case said the wideranging inquiry , by the justice department s campaign financing task force , is examining whether senator torricelli , democrat of new jersey , and several former campaign aides played any role in a series of improper donations or conspired to evade laws governing the use of campaign and public funds , these people said the prosecutors are also investigating whether mr torricelli or others close to him acted to impede the inquiry by dissuading a major political contributor who has become a key witness in the case from cooperating with the government , lawyers and others said in an interview last week , mr torricelli denied any wrongdoing he called the inquiry a frightening instance of overzealous law enforcement and the worst experience of my life this is the ultimate example , he said , of attempting to find something anything on somebody of significance lawyers for mr torricelli said they were told by the justice department early last month that he was not then a target of the investigation , the formal term it uses to advise a person who faces the imminent possibility of criminal indictment but three former campaign aides were notified two weeks ago that they were targets of the inquiry , a move that defense lawyers criticized as a crude attempt to press the subordinates for information about their boss a justice department spokeswoman , chris watney , said she would not comment on the inquiry an examination of the federal case , based on interviews with lawyers , grand jury witnesses and others , as well as a review of internal campaign documents , indicates that what began in 1997 as a relatively modest look at some questionable contributions to the 12 million torricelli campaign has expanded over the last two years into an exhaustive audit of its fundraising and finances since last year , dozens of mr torricelli s fundraisers , former aides and other associates have been questioned by federal agents or called before a federal grand jury in newark that has been examining the case in response to broad government subpoenas , the campaign has handed over 70 , 000 pages of documents , lawyers said , and mr torricelli and his former aides have spent nearly 600 , 000 on legal bills , much of it raised from wealthy supporters yet what may be the most significant evidence against the senator and the most problematic for the government has emerged from the testimony of a single witness david chang , a new jersey businessman who raised funds for mr torricelli , chartered a plane for his travels and pleaded guilty last year to making 53 , 700 in illegal donations to his 1996 campaign since agreeing to cooperate with the prosecutors for a lighter sentence , mr chang , 57 , has described a close and opportunistic political friendship , one in which he lavished contributions and gifts on mr torricelli in return for his promise to help mr chang recover 71 million that the north korean government owed him for grain shipments he had brokered in the early 1990 s by mr chang s account , several people familiar with his debriefings said , mr torricelli was not only aware of some of his illegal donations but also encouraged them these included contributions like the plane charters as well as others he made directly or funneled through third parties lawyers familiar with the inquiry said the prosecutors were also pursuing claims by mr chang that mr torricelli and a few of his allies had discouraged mr chang from cooperating with the government and had even suggested that he flee the country until the federal investigation ended but in the thick file of their earlier effort to prosecute mr chang on charges of conspiracy and obstruction of justice , government lawyers left little of mr chang s reputation intact there , the man who dined at the white house and was courted in washington as a dynamic international businessman is portrayed as a phony who falsified documents and pressured associates to lie on his behalf the lead lawyer for mr torricelli s campaign , robert f bauer , dismissed mr chang s reported statements to investigators as the fevered imaginings of a pathological liar , and said he would not dignify them with specific denials almost anything of consequence that passes through david chang s lips is wrong , is false , mr bauer said mr chang s lawyer , bradley d simon , demurred obviously , senator torricelli and his subordinates feel that it s now in their interest to try to discredit david chang at any cost , he said over the course of several years , senator torricelli never hesitated to use mr chang for his own purposes the facts are what they are and will come out in due time whether the torricelli case is more

prosecution or before the grand jury in newark
in the 1970 s and 1980 s one often read about remote mountain villages where people stayed healthy and vigorous into their 90 s , with some individuals reaching extraordinary ages how did people in these simple , traditional societies achieve such longevity \? the answer , it turned out , was that people in simple , traditional societies are n't very good at counting there were some quite old people in those villages , but they were n't as old as they thought they were of course , one reason people were vague about their ages was that in their societies nothing important hinged on getting the numbers right in one respect , the story of our vaunted new economy is similar in the last few years of the 1990 s the data just kept getting better , culminating in an estimated 5 percent growth rate for real gdp in 2000 not an unusual growth rate for a poor country playing catchup , or for an economy recovering from a recession , but amazing for an advanced economy late in an economic expansion how did we do it \? the answer , it seems , is that we were n't very good at counting last month s revision by government statisticians marked down us growth rates in each of the last three years , with the biggest markdown for 2000 at 41 percent growth was good , but not as good as we thought it was but there s one difference between us and the villagers in our society numbers matter a great deal , and fuzzy math can have nasty consequences it s clear in retrospect that we should n't have taken the original estimates of economic growth too seriously anyone who has looked at how economic statistics are constructed knows that they are based as much on educated guesswork as on hard facts and the guesswork gets more speculative as the economy s center of gravity shifts away from solid , physical products to more ethereal stuff the biggest item in last month s revision involved a reduction in estimates of business investment in software nonetheless , people who should have known better treated the estimated growth rates as solid data , and in particular took to heart their apparent message that the best was yet to come according to the figures , the us economy was n't just growing fast , it was growing at an accelerating pace and if that continued , all of our worries about the long run about the burdens of providing pensions and health care to an aging population would simply melt away in the face of a redhot economy chief among the whatmeworriers was none other than alan greenspan his crucial january testimony in favor of big tax cuts began with a paean of praise for the productivity revolution , the key factor driving the cumulative upward revisions in the budget picture , and cited with approval longterm projections of an onbudget surplus under baseline assumptions well past 2030 seven months later the productivity estimates had been revised downward , and the onbudget surplus was gone mr greenspan is still optimistic about longrun growth , as are many other people they argue that a productivity revolution driven by information technology has decades to run i would respectfully submit , however , that these optimists have no idea what they are talking about i do n't mean that they 're necessarily wrong i mean that history has repeatedly made fools of people who try to predict future technological developments , let alone the implications of those developments for longterm economic growth and most of the mistakes have been in the same direction since the 1960 s , futurists have consistently overestimated the future rate of technological progress and economic growth \( rent 2001 a space odyssey or read herman kahn s the year 2000 if you do n't believe me \) the only major upside surprise was the productivity surge from 1995 to 2000 and that , it turns out , was partly a figment of our statistical imagination so how should our society conduct itself now that the recent past is not what it used to be \? any villager could tell you the answer hope for good news but do n't count on it that is , do n't commit yourself to tax cuts and spending promises you may not be able to afford but of course we have already made those commitments so the question becomes , will our leaders ever admit that they made a mistake , that we may not be able to afford the full tax cut after all \? and the answer is obvious we should live so long
the lost children of wilder the epic struggle to change foster care by nina bernstein 482 pp new york pantheon books 2750 one of president bush s first official acts was to propose that religiously sponsored organizations should get public money to provide social services in ways this is an admirable proposal religious organizations can count on motivated participants , and those in need of help often trust religious charities more than the agencies of the local government but there is always the danger that the religious organizations will favor their own , or impose their own moral views on their clients the lost children of wilder is a brilliantly researched account of an attempt to make the new york city foster care system fair for all its children obviously nina bernstein s book was written before george w bush took office but it provides a vivid argument against his plans since the 19th century , new york s foster care system had handled its needy children by contracting with private agencies to care for the children at public expense many , perhaps most , of the agencies were jewish and roman catholic charities the law allowed them to give preference to children of their own faith in 1972 , 90 percent of all foster beds were in the hands of these agencies , which could pick and choose among the children the city tried to place black children , of course , were mostly protestant that was the year shirley wilder entered the foster care system she was 13 her mother had died when she was 4 , her grandmother when she was 11 when she turned to her father , whose name she did not bear , he threw her out over the next 10 months , every religiously sponsored foster agency the court approached turned her down but her lawyer really liked her , and did n't want to send her to the dickensian reformatory at hudson , ny , for children convicted of criminal offenses , then the last resort for children rejected by foster care the lawyer came back to the court 12 times , as shirley shuttled among relatives , shelters and jaillike detention centers , to find some alternative none were available when shirley arrived at hudson she was raped by one of the girl gangs she fought back , and the staff punished her for fighting by locking her in solitary confinement when she was released , she ran away she was caught , returned and placed in solitary confinement for three days then she was transferred to the behavior modification unit , where the toilet paper was doled out one roll a month , the staff hit the kids , and to eat in the dining room you needed the tokens that were given out for good behavior shirley became rebellious and difficult and yet a lawyer who visited her recalled she had the most beautiful smile , a smile that lit up her face she was pretty and she was funny she had this great sense of humor she was the perfect testcase plaintiff the lawyer was marcia lowry , a fierce jewish misfit who for years kept a tattered poster quoting eugene v debs on her office wall while there is a lower class i am in it while there is a criminal element i am of it and while there is a soul in prison i am not free she had been hired by the new york civil liberties union after working within the city s administration on fostercare issues she was shocked by the fact that over half of the city s many thousands of wards were , like shirley , black , but in the catholic and jewish agencies that received most of the public s dollars , fewer than a quarter were black bernstein , who wrote a series about the wilder case while a reporter for newsday and is now a reporter for the new york times , tells us that in lowry s view the city had delegated the public good wholesale to a collection of sectarian agencies with a license to discriminate when wilder was filed in federal court on july 14 , 1973 , it named as defendants six state and city officials and 77 voluntary agencies and their directors , and asked the courts to declare unconstitutional the entire statutory basis for the provision of child welfare services to new york city children the lost children of wilder describes the 26year history of the case that was at last settled , more or less in shirley wilder s favor , in 1999 its legal analysis is rich , but as in jarndyce and jarndyce the drama is human people who saw themselves as genuinely committed to these difficult kids suddenly found themselves attacked for racism and in effect asked to turn their services over to the forces who had created hellholes like hudson the judge who first heard shirley wilder s plea had struggled to make wise choices within limited options for decades , and had been denounced in tabloid headlines daughter of rabbi wise gives child of christ to the black bearded prophet of mohammed she came from an unbroken lineage of rabbis stretching back 19 generations , and when the american civil liberties union was prepared to settle the lawsuit with the city the settlement included a specially designated status for orthodox jews she fought against it with outrage and elegance the man who became the city s corporation counsel was an heir to f a o schwarz , and yet somehow managed an austere authenticity sufficient to persuade opponents who hated each other to come to terms and around these stories , bureaucracy becomes character , stage setting and plot , as the case drags through postponements , delay , appeal and absurdly irrelevant adjudications
aside from the quadruple bypass surgery , the ventricular arrhythmia , the cerebral vascular disease , the basal cell carcinoma , the abdominal aortic aneurysm and the peptic ulcer , rudy casale has problems mr casale , who is 74 , pleaded guilty in may to using extortionate methods to collect a debt from an unlucky russian gambler a year ago somewhat unlucky himself , he was caught on a secret government tape boasting to the gambler , i got a nice baseball bat in my trunk , bust up your legs , that s all on a recent afternoon , mr casale discussed the debtcollection charges with a visitor to his home in the quaintly nautical neighborhood of mill basin , brooklyn when the visitor arrived , mr casale turned off the spaghetti western he was watching , lifted his plaid shirt to his chin , displayed the fiveinch surgical scar that runs like unused railroad tracks across his chest and said that he could not be a mafia enforcer since he was clearly falling apart i opened my big mouth because i'm stupid , he said of the government tapes but that s just the way i talk you hit my car , i blow my top i say i want to kill you i 'd never actually hurt anybody i just talk like an idiot what can i say \? federal prosecutors say that , despite his age and ailments , mr casale was , in fact , a mob enforcer and served for many years as the driver for john faraci , a powerful bonanno family soldier known in the underworld as johnny green while mr casale admits he drove mr faraci to the barber shop , the doctor s office and occasionally to run some errands for the mob , he insists that aside from threatening the russian gambler , he never once helped mr faraci commit a crime we never discussed business never , mr casale explained football , baseball , things in general that s what we talked about the stuff you read in the news everyday on thursday , mr casale appeared in federal district court in brooklyn and essentially changed his mind about his case , telling judge reena raggi that he was not guilty even though he had pleaded guilty judge raggi , perturbed by the sudden change of heart , told mr casale s lawyer , frank j hancock , you certainly have your work cut out for you now moments later , mr hancock said that his client was terribly ill a walking medical textbook was his exact description and asked the judge to allow mr casale to remain at home until he either goes to trial or is sentenced under his current guilty plea , if he chooses not to withdraw it judge raggi allowed mr casale to stay at home until june 22 , the deadline for withdrawing his plea the judge said it was not her job to arrange for his medical care but to deal with his criminal conduct while mr casale was clearly frustrated , he said he has resigned himself to serving you know , they can take my body , but they 'll never get my soul , he said that belongs to god they 'll have to wrestle him for that let me ask my uncle \( sam \) when a man has been accused of associating with the gambino crime family , making plans with his biological family can be tough perhaps none know this better than joseph burger and steven scala , two men from queens who are scheduled to go on trial this fall on charges of being part of the agnello crew , a cadre of mobsters said to be led by carmine agnello , the soninlaw of john j gotti , the jailed gambino family boss the government says that , acting on mr agnello s orders , mr burger and mr scala used mafia muscle to take control of the scrapmetal business among the junkyards and recycling plants of willets point , queens while the charges have not stopped either from fulfilling his obligations on the home front , they have made domestic life a little tricky mr burger s daughter is graduating from kindergarten on june 6 , but instead of simply showing up for the reception at the appointed time , mr burger had to ask the federal government in writing for permission to attend mr scala was forced to write a similar letter before he traveled with his own daughter last month mr scala is requesting permission to serve as a chaperone for his daughter s class trip to washington dc on may 11 , 2001 , his letter said the seventhgrade class of our lady of grace in howard beach will be leaving queens for washington dc at 5 00 am on may 11th and returning back to queens at approximately 11 00 pm one more piper to pay salvatore scala , a gambino family captain , and charles carneglia , a soldier in the family , were convicted on may 18 of extorting hundreds of dollars in protection money out of a ronkonkoma , long island pornography store called cherrie s video this is an excerpt from a conversation , secretly taped by the government , between the video store s owner and a man named carl kline , who has pleaded guilty to being mr scala s and mr carneglia s bagman mr kline well , we could cause you problems , number one number two , think of it like this you gotta pay lilco you gotta pay your electric bill , right \?

it is one of the classic photographs in new york city politics that of a smiling candidate standing on the steps of city hall , surrounded by the blackhatted hasidic jews who have just endorsed him the snapshot has taken on an almost superstitious charm in city politics , preposterously suggesting that the candidate has received the support not only of hasidic jews but of all jews last week , mark green took his place amid a crowd of hasidim , as aides circulated a statement saying that leaders from the satmar congregations of new york city , the largest of the three major hasidic groups in the city with some 100 , 000 followers supported his mayoral campaign but there is another superstition in new york politics beware the factions within hasidim as mr green smiled for the cameras , most of the leaders of the satmar establishment in new york city including its grand rabbi were actually in europe , unaware that political endorsements were being made in the name of the satmars many of the hasidim surrounding mr green in the picture belonged to a smaller group that is at odds with the satmar establishment , which is based in williamsburg , brooklyn a few of them live in orange county , precluding them from voting for mr green including the man who stood next to him , abraham wieder , the mayor of the satmar village of kiryas joel reached at his workplace in orange county yesterday , mr wieder declined to discuss the endorsement it s a matter that has to do with brooklyn , he said exactly , said rabbi isaac wertheimer , the man chosen to discuss the matter by the satmar leadership in williamsburg it s obvious that those people who endorsed mark green wanted to take advantage of mark green and make him think they were the leaders , he said mark green , i guess , he did n't know exactly what he was getting into joe deplasco , the spokesman for the green campaign , sought last night to present the confusing and somewhat embarrassing situation in the best possible light we are very pleased to receive the support of some of the leaders , he said and we are hopeful to receive the support of other hasidic leaders around the city he declined to say whether mr green s advisers knew beforehand that the satmar members surrounding their candidate did not represent what is traditionally considered to be the city s satmar leadership , or that some were not registered to vote in the city he also said that if the news release which gave the distinct impression that the entire satmar congregation supported mr green had explained the nuances and divisions within this community , it would have been 20 pages long mr deplasco also acknowledged that the release had inadvertently suggested that there were 100 , 000 satmars in the city , all ostensibly lining up behind mr green in fact , members of the satmar community say , there are perhaps 100 , 000 satmars in the world , with less than half of them living in new york city he said that mr green planned to meet with a son and soninlaw of the grand rabbi , moses teitelbaum , next week to talk about his vision for the city but he did not know which son of rabbi teitelbaum which , in the saga of the satmar , is a crucial detail for the last few years , the followers of two of the grand rabbi s sons have been battling over which son will succeed their father as the spiritual leader of all satmar members one son , zelman teitelbaum , is the rabbi of the congregation in williamsburg , with 25 , 000 to 30 , 000 members he has the backing of the satmar establishment another son , aaron teitelbaum , is the rabbi of the kiryas joel congregation , with about 14 , 000 members , in orange county he is supported by some satmar members in brooklyn , and by der blatt , a yiddishlanguage newspaper the battles are so contentious that the leaders cannot agree about the outcome of an election earlier this year to determine the leadership for congregation yetev lev , the synagogue in williamsburg who won \? it depends , said one prominent satmar member religious wars are very complicated while rabbi moses teitelbaum , his son zalmen , and other satmar leaders from williamsburg traveled to hungary and to poland last week , a contingent led by mr wieder , mayor of kiryas joel , and jack brach , the editor of der blatt , organized the news conference with the green campaign to announce the endorsement at city hall at the event , mr wieder acknowledged that he lived in orange county , but said that he urged the thousands of graduates of a rabbinical school in kiryas joel who now live in new york to vote for mr green in turn , mr green spoke of his own jewish heritage , and said that there s no more important honor than being endorsed by the great religious leaders of our city rabbi wertheimer , the spokesman for the satmar establishment , said news of the endorsement surprised many in williamsburg in the community it was a joke , he said this is not to say that the satmar establishment may not one day come out in support of mr green the hasidic community in new york is grappling with serious social issues , from insufficient housing for its growing numbers to the special needs of some of its children , and none of its sects wants to back the losing mayoral candidate but samuel c heilman , a professor of jewish studies at the city university of new york , said politicians are often ignorant of the factions within insular hasidic communities like the satmar , as well as the distinctions between the various hasidic sects from the bobov to the pupa to the lubavitch what appears simple is often quite the opposite , he said although it makes for a nice photograph the whole point is the sea of black , he said and once you see the sea of black , you do n't see the shades of gray photo abraham wieder , right , and other satmar members endorsed mark green , center , last week at city hall \( don hogan charles the new york times \)
east rutherford , nj , may 15 almost halfway through tonight s game , the devils had a 20 lead and pittsburgh s mario lemieux , the playing owner , had as many shots and points in this series as any other national hockey league executive none near the end of a shift , lemieux tried to check john madden of the devils near the boards he broke his stick and dropped it madden glanced at a referee in a futile plea for a penalty , then swept lemieux s stick down the ice with disdain why not \? lemieux seemed to have little use for it , even when it was whole a few minutes later , there were important changes in lemieux s shot total , his point total , the score of the game and the momentum of the eastern conference finals first , lemieux set up a shorthanded goal when his shot was rebounded by aleksei morozov then , lemieux created an evenstrength goal by jumping on the ice , stealing a pass and setting up aleksei kovalev then the penguins scored two more goals to take a 42 victory and even this series at one victory apiece that s all i saw yesterday on espn no shots on goal , lemieux said with a smile , referring to his game 1 statistics i think i got one or two tonight i broke the ice he also helped break the smug confidence of the defending champion devils playing against one of the nhl s most explosive clubs , the devils may have fallen into a false sense of security their goalie , martin brodeur , who stopped 19 of 23 shots , was not as sharp as usual their forwards got greedy their defensemen got sloppy rene corbet and robert lang got the other goals for the penguins jay pandolfo and petr sykora scored for the devils everything they got , we gave to them , devils coach larry robinson said it is a common refrain with these devils when they lose , they often say they beat themselves randy mckay , the veteran right wing , said it was because we just quit playing hard he said the devils let the shorthanded goal upset them they were still upset after the game there s no excuse , said scott gomez , who was stopped on a powerplay breakaway by goalie johan hedberg when the devils led by 21 , soon after pittsburgh s shorthanded goal was the gomez breakaway the turning point of the game \? keep reading we took things for granted , gomez said we had them on their heels ken daneyko , the veteran defenseman , who was one of lemieux s victims , added we got away from our game and started cheating a little on the offensive side we could have buried them games 3 and 4 of this fourofsevengame series are in pittsburgh on thursday night and saturday afternoon the winner meets either colorado or st louis in the finals the first period ended with the devils holding a 20 lead pandolfo got his first goal of the playoffs at 8 minutes 52 seconds from the rightwing corner when he tried to pass to sergei nemchinov in the slot and the puck bounced in off hedberg after gomez was penalized for roughing hedberg , sykora scored on a shorthanded breakaway that was triggered by passes from scott stevens and patrik elias after kovalev failed to control a pass behind the new jersey net the second period was a reversal , and it ended with the penguins holding a 32 lead the momentum changed on a devils power play when morozov scored while shorthanded on a twoonone rush with lemieux after lemieux s shot was partly deflected by scott niedermayer , brodeur made a save but left a rebound that was swept past him at 9 20 got four guys caught down low on the power play , robinson said that was the start of it the penguins made it 22 at 12 17 on a goal by kovalev , who was skating on a rare shift with both lemieux and jaromir jagr lemieux , coming off the bench for a line change , jumped over the boards and into the play by intercepting daneyko s clearing pass and flipping the puck to kovalev kovalev onetimed a slap shot from the rightwing circle i was looking to flip it out , daneyko said they wait in the weeds , and they are able to capitalize on their opportunities the penguins made it 32 at 15 55 when corbet beat devils defenseman brian rafalski in a contest for a bouncing puck in the slot , then flipped it between the pads of brodeur lang got the last one at 5 19 of the third period after a pass from kovalev although there were many pivotal moments , the one that many reporters kept asking about afterward was the gomez breakaway and the save by hedberg , who stopped 27 of 29 shots the devils are not used to so much news media attention and stevens , the captain , became annoyed when he repeatedly heard the question about the gomez breakaway with a harsh exclamation , stevens stormed away from reporters , charged into the offlimits room , came back out , slammed a door and stalked , redfaced , out of the room , his jacket collar turned up high on the back of his neck slap shots scott niedermayer played for the first time in 12 days he sustained a concussion in game 4 of the toronto series when the maple leafs' tie domi elbowed him in the head sergei brylin played for the first time in two weeks , since injuring his right knee in game 3 at toronto photos penguins' aleksei morozov celebrating his shorthanded goal past martin brodeur in the second period his goal made the score 21 and ignited pittsburgh s comeback \( chang w lee the new york times \) \( pg d1 \) scott gomez charging into pittsburgh goalie johan hedberg last night as the puck slid past the net during the devils' twogoal first period \( g paul burnett the new york times \) \( pg d5 \)

this oct 3 , baseball will mark the 50th anniversary of arguably the greatest moment in sports bobby thomson s home run , a threerun shot in the last of the ninth inning of a playoff game that completed the amazing comeback of the new york giants , pronounced dead two months before but recent disclosures have left less to celebrate the giants may have stolen the 1951 national league pennant with a telescope and a buzzer as recounted jan 31 in rich detail by joshua harris prager in the wall street journal , giants manager leo durocher began in late july 1951 to station a spy in the center field clubhouse at the polo grounds to intercept opponents' pitching signals throughout their 399 drive to the pennant , new york batters knew what pitch was coming at the polo grounds , ostensibly giving the giants a crucial and unfair advantage as they overtook a powerful dodger team now that the halfcenturyold secret is out , their achievement is tarnished and the luster is off one of baseball s greatest stories but did the scheme actually work \? durocher s common sense told him that his hitters would eat up the fastballs and breaking pitches they knew were on the way , tipped off by prearranged signals from the dugout and bullpen after returning from a long road trip , the giants opened an extended homestand on aug 11 that would provide them with their first real chance to benefit from the spy system they got off to a poor start , losing to the phillies , 40 , and falling 13 1 2 games behind the dodgers from that day through the end of the season , the giants scored just 46 runs a game , home and away , after averaging 51 before that while the giants were catching and passing the dodgers , and cheating at the polo grounds , their offense actually declined by half a run per game even more surprisingly , no giant regular seemed to have benefited from the scheme a gamebygame analysis of new york s pennant drive shows that the giants had more trouble scoring runs at the polo grounds than they did on the road during those last 48 games , the giants scored 495 runs a game as a visiting team , a slight improvement over the 479 they had been averaging on the road before aug 11 astonishingly , after the spy scheme was in place , the giants scored 427 runs a game at home , down from the 554 they had previously averaged at the polo grounds and representing a 23 percent loss in run production at home and during that period , five of the eight regulars thomson , monte irvin , don mueller , alvin dark and wes westrum actually hit for a better average on the road than at home not that any of it mattered the team was 184 on the road and 215 in new york it seems the giants won the pennant despite cheating during the pennant drive , four of the eight giant regulars willie mays , dark , eddie stanky and westrum slumped noticeably whitey lockman and mueller barely changed irvin improved , but he had been on the rise long before in late june , batting 278 , he altered his stance and began to hit to all fields that adjustment produced immediate results from june 28 to aug 10 he batted 348 irvin was one of the giants who preferred not to know the signs roughly half the giants , according to a teammate , al corwin , did not , if only because they might be distracted by the signals irvin continued to hit well for the rest of the season , though for a slightly lower average than in the previous six weeks at first glance , the 27yearold thomson would appear to have greatly benefited from the spying system but his revival began near the allstar game , when he closed his stance after repeated urging by his teammates batting 231 on july 13 , he raised his average 25 points over the next 27 games , going 29 for 87 with 7 home runs and 23 runs batted in only four of those games against a weak , visiting reds team were played under durocher s new ground rules thomson stayed hot into october , though he hit only 3 of his 10 home runs after aug 10 at home \( before that , he had hit 10 at the polo grounds and 12 at other parks \) while he was never better that year , his overall performance in 1951 , at an age when players commonly peak , is in line with his excellent seasons in 1947 and 1949 the giants as a team might be expected to have hit more home runs , sitting on pitches they saw coming yet the frequency of their home runs went down before aug 11 , they had accumulated 130 in 109 games they added 49 in their last 48 giant hitters could not have been much troubled , at least initially , by the pressure of a tight race by the time the giants materialized from nowhere , it was brooklyn that was swallowing hard runs scored per team in the national league did diminish by half a run per game after aug 10 , almost exactly duplicating the giants' decline and indicating that giants hitters were neither helped nor hurt by the spy scheme however , the league s decline was led by the second division , four beaten teams without illusions playing out the season the coasting , then anxious dodgers also stopped scoring the fourthplace braves maintained the same level of scoring as before the cardinals increased their run production by nearly half a run a game as they rallied to finish third giants hitters were strangely uninspired while their team recorded an 813 winning percentage over nearly a third of a season

klamath falls , ore , july 7 the sheriff will not arrest the prosecutor will not prosecute the local irrigation district has turned a blind eye desperate situations , they suggest , justify desperate measures three times in the last week , people here have taken the law into their own hands , reopening a flow of irrigation water that the federal government has halted since april 7 to protect endangered fish three times , too , the local authorities have declined to intervene , leaving the task to the federal bureau of reclamation , whose officials say the situation here has deteriorated to a point unprecedented in the agency s 99year history we 've never ever been in a situation where we 're unable to deliver water to anybody , said jeffrey s mccracken , a bureau spokesman and we 've never been in a position where we 've had to seek guidance from federal law enforcement to prevent destruction to our property it is no secret here just who has taken part in what sympathizers call civil disobedience after the most recent incident , on the fourth of july , their photographs were published in a local newspaper , and video footage of their actions was broadcast on local television but anger here runs deep in what is becoming a war over water , farms and fish the county sheriff , tim evinger , who watched the latest illegal opening of the waterway from his patrol car , but declined to intervene , said this particular brand of lawbreaking was none of his business the federal authorities , too , have not taken any action everyone understood the position this would put me in with my constituents , said mr evinger , who added that he and federal authorities had agreed weeks ago that if it came to choosing sides over efforts to resume the water flow , it would be best if the county sheriff took a pass because of the lack of cooperation from the local authorities , the bureau of reclamation has asked for help from the federal bureau of investigation and the united states marshals service but even those agencies seem ambivalent about what to do in a statement issued friday , the fbi said only that it would heed any request from the office of the united states attorney in portland to investigate the district marshal , reginald b madsen , said in an interview from his office in portland that none of his officers had been dispatched to klamath falls the united states attorney s office in portland did not respond to a telephone message the plight of the 1 , 400 farmers cut off from vital water here along the oregoncalifornia border has become a rallying cry among groups seeking to amend the endangered species act , the 1977 law that ranks the interests of certain plants and animals over human economic interests it was to adhere to the act that bureau of reclamation , which has provided irrigation water to farmers in this basin since 1907 , decided this year that it could not permit the farmers any water at all , so that the endangered suckerfish and the threatened coho salmon could be guaranteed the maximum amount the interior department is reviewing the biological opinion , by the fish and wildlife service , about the fish that left the reclamation bureau no option but to carry out the water cutoff the department is also studying a request from two area congressmen , representative wally herger , a california republican , and representative greg walden , republican of oregon , along with the pacific legal foundation , a nonprofit law firm in sacramento that specializes in property rights cases , to address the rival claims to water by convening the endangered species committee , a rarely used federal panel that has the power to overrule provisions of the law if it determines that human interests should be granted a higher priority in a year of record drought , which has forced water issues to a head across the west , many people in the klamath basin also regard the endangered species act as a foe but here , along the oregoncalifornia border , the issue is anything but abstract about 200 , 000 acres of farmland have been left parched by the water cutoff , and the people who depend on them say they have begun to revise their views of right and wrong people in rural america , by and large , are true patriots , said bob grasser , who is the coowner of a fertilizer business here , where revenues are down 85 percent from a year ago but we 're not too patriotic here anymore it feels like our freedom is being betrayed we just ca n't believe that a great country would do this to our own people the farmers , the police , and the federal government are not the only players in this drama by treaty , local indian tribes have rights to the fish , which they describe as playing an important cultural role , even though the suckerfish in particular , as a bottomfeeder , is not prized for its palatability far downstream , where the klamath river meets the pacific along the california coast , commercial salmon fishermen say that the years in which tremendous amounts of klamath water were diverted for the farmers have all but destroyed their business
thailand was no good , 8yearold pyi son aung said , his black hair flopping forward on his forehead , his dark eyes open wide to explain , he held his palms together and cocked his fingers in the timehonored imitation of a gun brrrr , brrrr , brrrr , brrrr , brrrrrr , he shouted as he sprayed the walls of his living room with bullets from an imaginary weapon the apartment in which pyi son is reliving his past is tiny , a onebedroom fourthfloor walkup on 187th street , just off the grand concourse in the fordham section of the bronx the neighborhood is working class , characterized by bodegas , greasy chicken restaurants and carrepair shops pyi son lives here with his parents , his three sisters and , sometimes , an uncle and a family friend a decade after the disintegration of the soviet union and the end of the cold war , new york is home to large numbers of a special kind of immigrant refugees from around the globe pyi son s family fled to thailand from the military dictatorship in their native myanmar \( formerly burma \) but the city s refugees come from many other places some are from the former soviet republics or vietnam others have fled messy conflicts and local tyrannies that have spewed forth in this new multipolar world civil wars in africa , ethnic strife in the former yugoslavia , and fundamentalist religious regimes or insurgency movements more than 42 , 000 of them arrived in the city from 1994 to 2000 , according to the state bureau of refugee and immigration affairs the numbers of refugees entering new york ballooned in the mid90 s , as tens of thousands escaped the balkan wars and fighting in central africa today a smaller but steadier stream arrives from around the world unlike many immigrants , refugees often arrive with little property , no money and physical and psychological ills and while in an age of jet travel it is increasingly easy for immigrants to visit their homeland , for refugees there literally is no going back pyi son s family came to the bronx nearly a year ago after years of terror in southeast asia first they endured the political turmoil in myanmar then , after fleeing to thailand in 1998 , they spent two devastating years in a refugee camp what would happen if they returned home \?

inside the white house situation room on the morning terrorism transformed america , franklin c miller , the director for defense policy , was suddenly gripped by a staggering fear the white house could be hit we could be going down the reports and rumors came in a torrent a car bomb had exploded at the state department the mall was in flames the pentagon had been destroyed planes were bearing down on the capital the white house was evacuated , leaving the national security team alone , trying to control a nation suddenly under siege and wondering if they were next mr miller had an aide send out the names of those present by email so that when and if we died , someone would know who was in there somewhere in the havoc of the moment , richard a clarke , then the white house counterterrorism chief , recalled the long drumbeat of warnings about terrorists striking on american soil , many of them delivered and debated in that very room after a third hijacked jet had sliced into the pentagon , others heard mr clarke say it first this is al qaeda an extensive review of the nation s antiterrorism efforts shows that for years before sept 11 , terror experts throughout the government understood the apocalyptic designs of osama bin laden but the top leaders never reacted as if they believed the country was as vulnerable as it proved to be that morning dozens of interviews with current and former officials demonstrate that even as the threat of terrorism mounted through eight years of the clinton administration and eight months of president bush , the government did not marshal its full forces against it the defensive work of tightening the borders and airport security was studied but never quite completed and though the white house undertook a covert campaign to kill mr bin laden , the government never mustered the critical mass of political will and ontheground intelligence for the kind of offensive against al qaeda it unleashed this fall the rising threat of the islamic jihad movement was first detected by united states investigators after the 1993 bombing of the world trade center the inquiry into that attack revealed a weakness in the immigration system used by one of the terrorists , but that hole was never plugged , and it was exploited by one of the sept 11 hijackers in 1996 , a state department dossier spelled out mr bin laden s operation and his antiamerican intentions and president bill clinton s own pollster told him the public would rally behind a war on terrorism but none was declared by 1997 , the threat of an islamic attack on america was so well recognized that an fbi agent warned of it in a public speech but that same year , a strategy for tightening airline security , proposed by a vicepresidential panel , was largely ignored in 2000 , after an algerian was caught coming into the country with explosives , a secret white house review recommended a crackdown on potential sleeper cells in the united states that review warned that the threat of attack remains high and laid out a plan for fighting terrorism but most of that plan remained undone last spring , when new threats surfaced , the bush administration devised a new strategy , which officials said included a striking departure from previous policy an extensive cia program to arm the northern alliance and other antitaliban forces in afghanistan that new proposal had wound its way to the desk of the national security adviser , condoleezza rice , and was ready to be delivered to the president for final approval on monday , sept 10 the government s fight against terrorism always seemed to fall short the sept 11 attack was a systematic failure of the way this country protects itself , said james woolsey , a former director of central intelligence it s aviation security delegated to the airlines , who did a lousy job it s a fighter aircraft deployment failure it s a foreign intelligence collection failure it s a domestic detection failure it s a visa and immigration policy failure the clinton administration intensified efforts against al qaeda after two united states embassies in africa were bombed in 1998 but by then , the terror network had gone global al qaeda became starbucks , said charles duelfer , a former state department official with cells across europe , africa and beyond even so , according to the interviews and documents , the government response to terrorism remained measured , even halting , reflecting the competing interests and judgments involved in fighting an illdefined foe the main weapon in president clinton s campaign to kill mr bin laden and his lieutenants was cruise missiles , which are fired from thousands of miles away while that made it difficult to hit mr bin laden as he moved around afghanistan , the president was reluctant to put american lives at risk but a basic problem throughout the fight against terrorism has been the lack of inside information the cia was surprised repeatedly by mr bin laden , not so much because it failed to pay attention , but because it lacked sources inside al qaeda there were no precise warnings of impending attacks , and the cia could not provide an exact location for mr bin laden , which was essential to the objective of killing him
washington , feb 9 his public comments tend toward the epigrammatic , and he makes little effort to conceal his appetite for restorative breaks i like to give short speeches , president bush told republicans a week ago at a retreat in williamsburg , va two days later , on his way into a gathering of democrats in farmington , pa , he said , i 'll answer some questions , and i'm going to head home and take a nap he is not all that keen on hail to the chief since inauguration day , mr bush has never been greeted by that tribute upon his arrival at a meeting or event when he had the kennedys over for dinner and a movie , he served hamburgers and hot dogs and an administration official said mr bush has been known to sit behind his desk in the oval office and lampoon the obsequiousness that often comes his way my , mr president , you look fabulous today ! mr bush will exclaim mr president , that was a magnificent speech ! every new chief executive inhabits the role in a distinctive way , and george w bush is establishing a nofuss , nosweat , lookmanohands presidency , his exertions ever measured , his outlook always mirthful if bill clinton s trademark expression was the quarterbitten lower lip , a deliberate signal of empathy , mr bush s is the impish grin , a deliberate signal of confidence and good cheer he revels in unpretentiousness , and he seems wholly undaunted by his new responsibilities then again , it is awfully hard to tell he has yet to hold a news conference , and political analysts note that his public appearances have been as contained and carefully staged as those of ronald reagan , whose trailblazing image guru , michael k deaver , has been consulted by the bush administration more than once last week , mr deaver had lunch with karl rove , the white house senior adviser and reports of mr bush s performances during those times when the television cameras are not around reveal some rough edges , especially when he is forced to stray beyond the confines of casual banter and familiar scripts several democrats at the pennsylvania gathering said mr bush grew tense and a tad peevish when challenged to delve into the details of his positions it s like he wants to say the least he can to get by , said one of these democrats , who added that mr bush took questions for about 35 minutes , then moved on to the handshaking , picturetaking phase of his visit he seemed , to some eyes , to enjoy that part a whole lot more the democratic gathering was on a sunday , which mr bush typically prefers to take off , and by many appearances , he is keeping a busier schedule than he did as the governor of texas advisers said he was almost always in the oval office by 7 30 am , often stayed until 7 pm and occasionally had a workrelated engagement after that but he does not permit the kind of runon meetings and extended evenings that mr clinton relished , and usually gets to bed by 10 pm he is clearly trying to pace himself around 11 30 am on wednesday , when a man fired shots outside the white house , mr bush was not ensconced in meetings in the west wing he was in the residence area of the white house exercising , presumably on the new fitness equipment that arrived on the heels of his inauguration today , he left for a weekend at camp david around 2 pm , not too long after a social gettogether at the white house with the basketball star karl malone and his family next friday , mr bush will travel to mexico on his first foreign trip as president , but he will not spend a single night there he plans to stop on the way back for two nights at his beloved ranch near waco , tex , where he will be reunited with laura bush , the first lady mrs bush left washington about a week ago to tend to the finishing touches on the couple s new house at their ranch mr clinton was forever chasing eloquence mr bush ambles along at a ceremony , he summarized his regard for his education secretary , roderick r paige , by saying , i picked a really good man a good man was also the appellation that mr bush hung on his commerce secretary , donald l evans on the canadian prime minister , jean chr tien on the federal reserve board chairman , alan greenspan and on several members of congress on thursday , at mr bush s first event in the rose garden , he groped for the right description of the setting , calling it such a beautiful , beautiful part of our national our national really our national park system , i guess you would want to call it the day before , mulling over the possibility of strikes at major airlines , mr bush said , i'm concerned about it , and so should america although the reliable buffet of malapropisms from his days as a presidential candidate has trickled to a lean cuisine , his sometimes herkyjerky syntax and violent subjectverb clashes live on , and he seems none too troubled by that according to the notes of one democrat at the pennsylvania gathering , mr bush made a joke about sometimes being misquoted in newspapers , saying , i have enough trouble stringing sentences together without people putting words in my mouth the gilded robes of the presidency have not obscured mr bush s innate goofiness or , for that matter , his insistent folksiness he wore a cowboy hat to the oval office two saturdays ago and left it atop his desk as he recorded his first weekly radio address that morning an aide said that on some mild nights mr bush sat outside the white house and did what he used to do outside the governor s mansion in austin hit a tennis ball with a racket so that spot , one of his two dogs , could dart across the grass to fetch it he s assumed these awesome responsibilities , and he takes them very seriously , but he still appears to be enjoying life every bit as much as he always has , karen p hughes , the counselor to the president , said in one of several recent conversations in another , ms hughes , who has worked for mr bush since 1994 , said , i 've been struck by how much himself he is she recalled reading something that george stephanopoulos , a former adviser to president bill clinton , wrote about feeling differently about mr clinton when he went from candidate to commander in chief i keep waiting for that to happen , ms hughes said i really have not felt that mr bush s advisers have wanted him to appear humble , given the narrowness of his victory in the election and the almost even divide of power between republicans and democrats in congress but mr bush also appears generally relaxed , and he exudes none of the squinty , squeaky hyperearnestness that was on display when he spoke directly into the television camera during the weeks of legal wrangling over the florida vote he s not the orator that clinton was , and he s not the kind of performer that ronald reagan was , and people do like a little of all of that , said leon e panetta , who served as mr clinton s chief of staff for much of his first term but mr panetta said that he felt mr bush was effectively conveying a sense of authenticity and sincerity and seems to have a very good approach to the rhythm of the job i think one of the key reasons he won is because people could relate to his style a lot better than they were able to relate to al gore , mr panetta said , and i think that s continuing in the presidency
albany , aug 27 a federal judge has fined members of an upstate family 80 , 000 for their aggressive tactics during abortion protests , a decision that lays out a legal road map for interpreting the state s 1999 clinic access law the ruling , in united states district court for the northern district of new york in utica , was the first application of the state s law and handed abortionrights forces a significant victory it s a complete win in the sense the legal precedent we got was precisely what we wanted , attorney general eliot l spitzer said today the decision follows a discussion among mayoral candidates in new york city about whether to expand the city s clinic access law to establish larger buffer zones around clinics the city council is expected to vote on the issue soon the judge , david n hurd , ruled that the kraeger family of lewis county had repeatedly threatened the director and staff members of a planned parenthood clinic in utica during demonstrations over a period of three and a half years the kraegers , which was among the organizers of the protests , said none of their tactics had constituted a threat a lawyer for the family said he would appeal besides imposing fines , judge hurd issued an order that sets up a large buffer zone around the clinic and prohibits joseph a kraeger his wife , victoria or their two children , sheri kraeger and vicki jo syverson , from entering it the defendants have protested for a long period of time , judge hurd said in the decision , which was filed friday but made public today often their protests have been proper and lawful however , they frequently walk on the line separating lawful from the unlawful exercise of their first amendment rights they have crossed over that line too many times to allow such conduct to go unaddressed judge hurd ruled , for instance , that victoria kraeger s decision to place a brownpaper package with no return address in the clinic s lobby amounted to a threat , because in the overheated atmosphere surrounding abortion protests , the clinic s director thought the package was a bomb it turned out to contain antiabortion pamphlets judge hurd also ruled that posters left outside the office and home of the clinic s director , margaret roberts , saying she had the blood of babies on her hands , were threats mr kraeger said the ruling was absurd we know what the laws are , he said we have been adhering specifically to the law we know exactly where the lines are mr kraeger said he did not expect justice from a court system that , in his view , did not protect unborn children a farmer who raises trout and does odd jobs as a welder , mr kraeger said he did not have 80 , 000 to pay the fines the judge also found other protest tactics unlawful he ruled that standing in front of cars entering the driveway to the clinic was threatening , as was offering to pay for personal information about the clinic s physician , just days after a doctor who performed abortions was shot and killed outside buffalo but the judge rejected some of the state s arguments he said , for instance , that the kraegers' practice of videotaping people coming and going from the clinic did not amount to a threat mr kraeger had argued that his family made the videotapes to document what happened if the demonstration turned into a melee the judge also said parking a van near the steps of another clinic was not a threatening act the director of the reproductive rights unit in the attorney general s office , jennifer k brown , said , it s important to us that there is now some law about what constitutes a violation of the new york state access law the lawyer for the kraegers , john j broderick , said the judge was simply wrong there were no threats , he said these people are quiet , prayerful people they did n't go around threatening people they just did n't state officials said they decided to prosecute the kraeger family , rather than other organizers , because their tactics could easily have caused violence congress passed a freedom of access to clinic entrances act in 1994 in response to increasing violence in protests outside clinics where abortions were performed the aim was to curb assaults , threats , bombings and , in some cases , killings new york state delayed in passing a version of a clinic access law , mostly because the

enron struggled yesterday to line up financing that would allow it to enter bankruptcy as a functioning company but its broken deal to merge with dynegy continued to cloud its efforts to reorganize as the two companies argued over who will control a natural gas pipeline that is one of enron s most prized assets federal prosecutors in four cities houston , where enron is based new york , the office with the most expertise prosecuting complex securities fraud cases and los angeles and san francisco , where enron s role in the electricity market became controversial earlier this year indicated an interest in the securities and exchange commission s investigation into enron , people close to the inquiry said none of the prosecutors have as yet convened a grand jury or issued subpoenas to enron , and it is not clear what action , if any , will be taken arthur andersen , enron s outside auditor , confirmed that it had been issued subpoenas in the sec investigation the fallout from enron s collapse continued around the globe in britain , the company dismissed 1 , 100 workers , one day after pricewaterhousecoopers , the accounting firm , took over supervision of enron s energy trading there in japan , investors scrambled to pull savings out of money market funds that held enron bonds , and the bank of japan took steps to assure there were enough reserves in the banking system to avoid a cash squeeze in the united states , enron employees braced for layoffs wall street analysts estimated that insurance companies' losses on investments in enron and policies covering its transactions could exceed 3 billion other energy traders , worried that enron would not be able to make good on its contracts , scrambled to find alternate sources of electricity and gas yesterday , enron and its advisers were in talks with bankers and other lenders about obtaining debtorinpossession financing , according to executives close to the talks such a credit line would be intended to allow enron , which until recently was the world s largest energy trader , to continue operating in some fashion while it tries to reorganize in bankruptcy court a bankruptcy filing is expected any day , although enron has said it is considering other options the complication for enron , however , is that lenders demand collateral in exchange for debtorinpossession financing , and it was enron s short supply of unmortgaged assets that helped kill efforts this week to revise the deal for dynegy to take over the company business on enron s trading floor , once its most valuable asset , has collapsed an alternative would be the proceeds from enron s pending sale of its portland general electric company , the local electric utility in oregon but another piece of collateral being considered by enron s advisers and lenders its largest natural gas pipeline , northern natural gas is at the center of a contentious dispute between dynegy and enron dynegy plans to take control of the pipeline on dec 12 it got preferred stock in northern natural gas in exchange for the 15 billion it pumped into enron as part of the original merger agreement and dynegy has said that it has exercised an option to acquire the common stock in the pipeline however , enron has said it is reviewing dynegy s assertion that it can take control of the pipeline , and people close to enron say the company may sue dynegy to block its takeover of the pipeline and for its decision to cancel the merger but dynegy said it would stand its ground northern natural gas cannot take certain actions , including seeking bankruptcy court protection , without the consent of dynegy as a preferred stockholder , a dynegy statement said concerns over the prospect of litigation with enron continued to weigh on dynegy stock , which closed yesterday at 3035 , off 98 percent , or 330 fitch , the credit rating agency , said it would continue to consider a downgrade for dynegy , saying the company s acquisition of northern natural gas will be subject to legal challenges of greater concern , fitch added , additional litigation revolving around dynegy s aborted merger appears likely , potentially creating unquantifiable financial liabilities enron s shares were the most actively traded issues on the new york stock exchange they continued to tumble , falling 10 cents to 26 cents as 1736 million shares changed hands enron is likely to seek a debtorinpossession loan of more than 1 billion , said one executive close to the talks the most likely providers are enron s lead banks , j p morgan chase and citigroup , which together have already lent 1 billion to the company , with enron s pipelines as security in a separate statement yesterday , fitch said it was not clear whether enron would be able to find the assets it would need to secure enough financing to persuade energy traders to resume doing business with it according to fitch , enron s two largest pipelines , northern natural gas and the transwestern pipeline company , are worth about 1 billion more than the total of the secured and unsecured claims against them and the 15 billion that dynegy invested fitch also noted that enron is expected to receive about 18 billion in cash or equivalents next year from the portland general sale in the sec s inquiry on enron , it appeared that one possibility being looked into by investigators was whether some of the offbalancesheet financing vehicles created by enron might have made it appear that operating cash flow was better than it actually was , and that what appeared to be cash flow was actually money that might have to be repaid later sec officials declined to comment on their investigation yesterday enron might also find itself in hot water with the internal revenue service over its treatment of employees who participate in its 401 \( k \) retirement plan as is typical , enron has received tax deductions for its contributions of enron stock to employees' accounts but senator barbara boxer , a california democrat , wants the irs to cancel those deductions because enron prevented its employees from selling the shares for a period of time enron employees have lost hundreds of millions of dollars as enron shares lost 99 percent of their value over the last year if the government takes back the funds enron owes in back taxes , she would like to see those resources go to the 401 \( k \) plan holders , said david sandretti , ms boxer s spokesman

as investors struggled to interpret a surprisingly negative report on unemployment , stocks dropped sharply early yesterday morning but quickly completed a somersault and posted fresh gains investors this week learned to love , or at least to live with , bad news , and the major gauges posted modest gains for the week as analysts began to anticipate somewhat more aggressive interest rate cuts by the federal reserve the reversal in the market , which was completed by 11 am , reflected deep divisions in perceptions of the economy s state and what , if anything , the fed could do about it the dow jones industrial average closed up 15459 points , or 14 percent , to 10 , 95124 , near its high for the year of 10 , 98363 , reached on feb 1 the nasdaq composite index rose 4533 points , or 21 percent , to 2 , 19153 , while the standard poor s 500stock index gained 1803 points , or 14 percent , to 1 , 26661 we 're at this seemingly anomalous situation where stocks rise on bad news , said david g dietze , president of point view financial services , a money management firm in summit , nj the bad news came at 8 30 am , when the labor department reported that the unemployment rate climbed to 45 percent last month after the elimination of 223 , 000 more jobs from american business payrolls the reported loss was the largest onemonth decline since february 1991 while regular trading had not yet begun , s p 500 futures contracts , which are traded throughout the night , almost exclusively by professional money managers , fell 14 percent immediately , moving below 1 , 240 from 1 , 255 the contracts stayed below 1 , 240 until about 9 30 am soon after , when the stock market opened , the s p 500stock index started just below 1 , 240 as well but stock prices climbed quickly , and the prices of futures contracts followed though analysts offered various explanations for the quick turnabout , perhaps none seemed as telling as a series of notes issued by merrill lynch , which did a quick turnaround of its own in a note issued to clients just before 9 30 am , the firm s economists wrote that the economy was beginning to look recessionary less than an hour later , the same firm wrote that after further consideration , we are not , at this point , moving to a recession forecast bruce steinberg , merrill s chief economist , said the apparent reversal was a result of an error by a person who tried to summarize his oral remarks , but that the whole incident was a good reminder of what happened to the market this morning treasury bond prices fell on the jobs data the 10year treasury note fell 1 32 , to 98 15 32 its yield was unchanged at 520 percent the 30year bond fell 15 32 , to 95 26 32 its yield , which moves in the opposite direction , rose to 567 percent from 563 percent after viewing the jobs data , several analysts said they expected the fed to lower interest rates by an additional halfpoint when it meets on may 15 they had previously expected a quarterpoint cut if that perception drove stock prices higher , investors reacted oddly because a cut of a quarterpoint more than previously expected should n't have nearly as much of a difference on the economy as it made in one day , said owen b fitzpatrick , who oversees 8 billion in stocks for the private banking group at deutsche bank s bankers trust unit several analysts said the market s movement reflected a split between investors who thought interest rate cuts would soon revive corporate earnings and those who thought a recession in earnings would seep increasingly further into the economy s underpinnings many money managers who have increased the cash levels of their portfolios now fear that the market has reached a bottom and that they will miss out on rising prices , some analysts said as optimism about the economy won the day , stocks that are sensitive to economic trends rose minnesota mining and manufacturing gained 224 , or 19 percent , to 11999 j p morgan chase gained 160 , or 327 percent , to 5060 microsoft rose 222 , or 324 percent , to 7075 , and ibm rose 216 , or 19 percent , to 11586 while some investors may have panicked the moment the jobs report was issued , a different sort of panic set in as the day wore on , the kind that has become increasingly common as investors have begun flinching less at bad news david henwood , chief investment officer for raymond james associates , described that kind of panic i did n't buy tech when it was cheap people are telling me the lows are in place , and you 've got to use weakness to

mtv s video music awards have become such an enormous event , seen in the united states by more than 27 million people \( and worldwide by at least three times that \) , that the host of the show has an opportunity to ignite a career or burn it to the ground that has intimidated some potential hosts in the past , but not jamie foxx , who will assume the duties of being funny , relevant and the stable center of a sometimeschaotic show tomorrow night on mtv at 8 it s exciting , not scary , mr foxx said during a break from rehearsals yesterday as long as you 've got funny things to say you 'll be all right we 've got funny things to say mr foxx , the recent star of his own sitcom on the wb network , has emerged in the past year as rising movie star , mainly with his turn as the volatile , talented quarterback in oliver stone s any given sunday this fall that career could get a significant boost with his performance as bundini brown , the svengaliesque righthand man to muhammad ali , in michael mann s muchanticipated epic biography of the boxer , played by will smith , who is a presenter on tomorrow night s show the hardest thing about that role \? growing my hair back in , mr foxx said , referring to bundini brown s famed balddownthemiddle look as host of the show , mr foxx follows , among others , chris rock , an enormous hit in the job , and the wayans brothers , who were somewhat less than that mr foxx , who started his career as a standup comic , said he was totally comfortable in the role we have jokes for everybody , he said some really are for everybody , some are for this group or that and we 've got the music to help us out the music acts performing on the threehour show will include u2 , jennifer lopez , jayz , linkin park , staind , britney spears , and 'n sync \( as usual , mtv is also promising some surprises , more or less depending on who decides to show up at the last minute \) mr foxx said he was familiar with almost all the artists there may be some that are n't in my cd collection , but mtv is there for every kind of genre , hiphop to randb to rock 'n' roll to maintain as much energy as possible , mr foxx said he was bringing the dj funkmaster flex to keep the music going during the commercial breaks and we 're going to open with a hiphop opera , he said mtv has used mr foxx prominently before , as a performer on its first mtv icon special last march , which celebrated the career of janet jackson but his television comedy is now out of production , and mr foxx said he was concentrating on getting his film career going we 're taking a little break from tv , he said , but we are working on developing some tv projects none of those projects is likely to have the impact of his three hours of work tomorrow night it s live there s no safety net , mr foxx said but you know that going in so it s cool sopranos go mute hbo s decision , now official , to hold back the next season of the sopranos means the network s most popular show of all time will be off the air for 15 months , surely the longest interregnum in television history but chris albrecht , the president of original programming for hbo , said he concluded that for the good of all his shows , this was the wisest course do i want sopranos' to go on in march \? absolutely , he said but the show is simply too labor intensive , especially in post production for the past several weeks mr albrecht had been wrestling with the choice of putting the sopranos back on the air in june , the earliest date it will be finished and ready , or holding it back for three months to avoid running it in the summer i think it would play fabulously in the summer , he said but the question would be at what hour mr albrecht did not want to dislodge his other top hit , sex and the city , from the 9 pm position it has occupied the past four summers that might have meant running the sopranos at either 8 pm or 10 pm , and neither of those options was too appealing i do n't want to get into a situation of favoring one show over another , mr albrecht said to us they 're equal we acknowledge how much 'the sopranos' means to us but we also have sex and the city' nothing is more important to us than that show that left the option of sitting on a finished season of the sopranos for three months , taking the risk of making its hungry fans either ravenous or disinterested from lack of feeding it s not ideal , mr albrecht said but this is what s best for the show in truth , mr albrecht is thinking really long term about the sopranos he noted that the delay until september will ease all the potential problems that might arise between two sopranos seasons these would include the need for the show s creator , david chase , to work out a story line for a possible fifth season for the show \( still not definite , mr albrecht said \) , as well as the desire for the show s stars to take some of the film roles now being thrown at them mr albrecht s plan now is to start that possible fifth season in september 2003 , giving mr chase and his cast a 15month break after the conclusion of season no 4 that also would set hbo up for a true assault on the start of the broadcast network season the next two septembers this month is the first time hbo has ever opened a fall season with original programming , challenging the big premieres on the broadcast networks band of brothers starts this sunday night , and next week the channel adds two original comedies , mind of the married man and curb your enthusiasm that competition has not given network programmers the shakes , but none of them worried much about six feet under this summer and they all got hurt by its appeal every network programmer fears the power of the sopranos and mr albrecht is still using it as a weapon he is now in the process of replaying all three previous seasons at 8 pm on sunday nights all the way to next march , when it will set up a second season of six feet under the strategy looks good at the moment , mr alrecht said the ratings for the repeats of the first season of 'the sopranos' are equal to what the show did when it was on the first time , he added and that s at 8 pm in the summer photo jamie foxx , mtv awards' host , on his own show seated , shireen crutchfield \( randy tepper wb \)
washington , april 26 on capitol hill , even language is partisan ask democrats about the republican proposal to steer taxpayer money to private schools , and they will rail about vouchers , a term they know sounds terse and bureaucratic and as lackluster as a supermarket coupon ask republicans about the initiative and they will coo about opportunity scholarships and school choice , carefully chosen words meant to cast a soft glow on the contentious idea the term voucher , which republicans view as tainted , is forbidden even in meetings it s referred to as the 'v' word , said marshall wittmann , a senior fellow at the hudson institute and a longtime advocate of conservative causes it s almost the oprahization of our political vocabulary if it does n't sound good on a talk show , then it s not useful never has finding the right political catch phrase been so important in washington s propaganda wars as now , a time of ceaseless campaigning , 24hour news cycles and profound voter fatigue the result is two parties that speak their own languages , each designed to push their own agendas for years , president bill clinton deftly used language to advance his issues and sweettalk the public mr clinton never spent tax dollars , for example , he invested them now republicans hope that with president bush in the white house , they will meet with similar linguistic success the first one that gets the right phrase on the argument usually has the moral highground , said tom donahue , president of the united states chamber of commerce , who has tried for years to gussyup trade issues with a new vocabulary the latest addition to the republican vocabulary is trade promotion authority , a term president bush used repeatedly last week as he talked trade in quebec for years , freetraders have been hoping to obliterate the more traditional name , fasttrack trade authority , which refers to the power congress can give a president to secure trade agreements with greater ease fasttrack is decidedly snappier and more neutral , but freetraders , upset that the effort to grant the president that authority failed in 1998 , say the term was coopted by organized labor and twisted to imply something slick and harmful trade promotion authority , free traders say , is more concise republicans have long felt inferior to democrats in finding the right phrase to sugarcoat a piece of legislation or to sully it , in large part because of mr clinton s skill at connecting with voters the first great communicator was roosevelt , said frank luntz , who runs focus groups and wrote the republican language manifesto , language of the 21st century , for capitol hill politicians the second one was ronald reagan , but none matched clinton s ability to stick an iv right into the vein of the public mindset democrats have a knack for choosing labels that resonate with real people and are picked up by reporters a patients' bill of rights , the name they gave legislation to overhaul the managed care system , still makes envious republicans cringe so much so that they borrowed it for their own legislation but , last year , republicans , who first focused on their communication skills under former speaker newt gingrich , scored a couple of big successes , namely with the clever labels given proposals for tax relief \( democrats would say tax cuts \) , the marriage penalty and the death tax they have done a fairly good job , stanley greenberg , a democratic pollster , said of republican efforts to finetune their language by proposing to reduce the marriage penalty , the quirk in the tax law that leads to some couples owing more in taxes than they would if they were unmarried and filed separate returns , republicans made it so appealing to most americans that its reduction now appears inevitable and by transforming the estate tax , which screamed wealth and privilege , to the death tax , which tied together two of life s inevitable , unpleasant rites , they helped the prospects of a tax cut that at first appeared to be an easy target for democrats it took five years to get republican lawmakers and lobbyists to use the words death tax consistently jack faris , the president and chief executive officer of the national federation of independent business , said he remembered his rotary club members complaining five years ago that the estate tax felt more like a tax on death mr faris took the phrase death tax back to his trade group and made everyone in the office use it those who slipped paid 1 into a pizza fund , he said , adding , the fund grew pretty large the pizza fund idea spread to capitol hill , where mr gingrich and others instituted it soon , everyone was using the term whoever the father is or was , god bless them , mr faris said , because it has really helped us shape the debate on the unfairness of the whole tax , not who is paying it democrats consider the term blatantly misleading because they say repealing that tax would benefit only the very rich in a good society , there ought to be some relationship between labels and underlying reality or you are into orwellian doublespeak , said mark mellman , a democratic pollster but democrats , too , tumble into that blurry realm of doublespeak a bill they introduced recently to permit federal aid to international family planning groups that counsel or promote abortion is called the global democracy promotion act and democrats once spoke strongly in favor of gun control , until public opinion polls showed the issue was a loser they switched to gun safety , recognizing that few americans want their guns controlled but the issue remained a loser , proving that substance ultimately does matter you ca n't change reality with wallpaper , said john mclaughlin , a republican pollster chart glossary language barrier democrats and republicans sometimes sound like they are speaking different languages when talking about the same issues some examples democrats school vouchers republicans opportunity scholarships democrats the estate tax republicans the death tax democrats fasttrack authority republicans tradepromotion authority democrats tax cuts republicans tax relief democrats affirmative action republicans quotas and preferences democrats a ban on abortion procedures republicans partialbirth abortion

summer does not truly arrive until school is out it does n't matter whether you are actually going to school any longer or not it does n't matter if you are sitting in an office all day or are on your way home , crammed in the middle of a threeseat bench in a commuter train because when you step off that train , summer has often come to the station to greet you i love summer for many reasons , but what i really treasure comes in small doses , delivered at the end of the day at train stations from new jersey to connecticut children are out of school and there is no homework keeping them chained inside , so they walk , bike , ride their scooters , inline skate or are driven to the station to meet their returning parents some days there are so many children on my platform you would have thought the circus had just let out you can hear the sounds of summer as soon as the train s doors open at the station it is a telling moment moments before , we are all gathered by the closed doors , waiting for them to open so we can get home we all have our grim new york faces on , we 're exhausted , and if that guy standing to my left thinks he s getting through those doors before me , he 'd better forget it then the doors open , and as we jump through them like football players diving for a fumble , the sweet sounds of the season change us from a tense mob to a bunch of gentle suburban parents daddy , come the shouts mommy on the platform are children , some alone , some with a parent or nanny , scanning the doors looking for their mothers or fathers like the softies we commuters really are , we all turn our heads toward the sound , aloofness gone we are hoping that this time it is our children who have come to greet us , that this time we have won the family lottery and can show everyone just how much we are loved and adored you see the hope in our eyes as we search the platform looking to see if the shouting is coming from our children every once in a while i win , but not as often as i once did my four children are a bit older now , and my coming home at night does n't generate the excitement it used to i walk to the station , and my two middle children , boys 11 and 9 , will sometimes skate or bike there to meet me they often have a contest to see who can spot me coming off the train first but after they savor my surprise and accept my hugs , they skate or bike home , leaving me behind , struggling to catch up i'm not the prize i used to be a few years ago when all my children would greet me more regularly , i left the platform one night , disappointed that they had not come , and began to walk home as i turned the corner onto my street , one of the neighborhood moms was hiding behind a bush with her newborn son in a stroller i had just seen her husband on my train i was about to say hello and ask what the heck she was doing behind the bush when she held her finger up to her lips i want to surprise my husband , she whispered she did n't have to explain i knew all too well the joy of going from the jaws of defeat , when none of the squealing children at the station are there for me , to the thrill of victory , when partway home i spot them racing down the street on their bikes to meet me a minute after i left the mom behind the bush , i heard her husband s shout of surprise and her laughter i turned around to look and he had taken his son out of the stroller and was kissing him then he kissed his wife welcome home i love those sounds of summer i love the time of year when our children lighten our commute and our spouses hide behind bushes all too soon the children will return to school , the clocks will be turned back and it will no longer be light when we get home then we will be alone again , heading home in the dark , another glum commuter hoping that our family has held dinner or , at the very least , that the children will even look up from their homework to acknowledge that we are home at all drawing \( andrea arroyo \)
seventy years ago , the new york fire department , hampered by an aging fleet of 10 steampowered fireboats , launched the john j harvey , the most powerful firefighting vessel of its time it was the first with internal combustion engines , five in all , and could pump water at 20 , 000 gallons a minute 20 fire engines' worth through bronze nozzles in streams 25 stories high the 130foot ship was launched in 1931 and named for a fireboat pilot who had been killed in action the year before it served in new york harbor until 1995 , when it was decommissioned for budgetary reasons it had fought the inferno that destroyed the ocean liner normandie in 1942 , doused the flames on a sinking munitions ship and , over the years , sprayed geysers to greet liners and celebrate the fourth of july but its greatest effort came on sept 11 the vessel had been saved from the scrap yard in 1999 by several marine history buffs who turned it into a floating museum that makes harbor trips and provides waterspouts for special events when the twin towers fell , the volunteer crew fired it up , raced down the hudson from a berth at pier 63 , at the foot of west 23rd street , and spent the next 80 hours pumping water to the firefighters working in the wreckage none of the hydrants west of the attack site worked , so the john j harvey , along with the city s two remaining large fireboats , provided much of the water through the rest of that week , firefighters said in interviews , some of the crew and owners recalled how a vessel that was placed on the national register of historic places last year ended up serving the city yet again as news of the attack spread , chase b welles , 40 , an owner of the vessel and a real estate agent from nyack , ny , drove to the city and then , after calling the fire commissioner s office , joined a police motorcade racing downtown at nearly 100 miles per hour when he saw the great black cloud rising , huntley f gill , 48 , a coowner of the boat and a real estate consultant from the upper west side , hopped on his bicycle and headed south to pier 63 tim ivory , 35 , the ship s chief engineer and a diesel mechanic , lived across the hudson river in little ferry , nj , but found someone to take him across in a speedboat tomas j cavallaro , 53 , an artist , lived four blocks from the harvey running toward the pier , he heard three blasts from the boat s whistle and barely made it aboard also just making it in time was andrew furber , 33 , a web site designer , welder and deckhand aboard the harvey at first , they started ferrying ashcaked survivors away from the collapsed buildings about 150 people just hurled themselves over the gunwales , mr gill said women were leaving their shoes behind but almost immediately , a call came in from the fire department they desperately needed water pressure the john j harvey joined the city s two active large fireboats and , lashed to the bulkheads at the world financial center , revved up the pumps to become a floating fire hydrant a lieutenant handed them a radio 'you guys are marine 2 , ' he told us , mr gill said that was her old designation but the old valves were jammed in the position for spraying water into the air , and they needed to shunt the water into hoses that would take it ashore mr ivory had to improvise with a sledgehammer , he jammed soda bottles and wood in the nozzles , forcing the water into the hoses firefighters hauled an octopus assemblage of hoses toward the center of the carnage they walked a few yards into what looked like a russian winter , mr cavallaro recalled mr furber was enlisted by rescue workers ashore to take a cutting torch and help extract bodies from crushed cars and the towers' mangled skeleton he worked through the night , and was drained by the grisly task when he returned , i did not recognize him , mr cavallaro said from tuesday until friday afternoon , with the help of other volunteers and coowners of the boat there are about a dozen the crew of the john j harvey kept the water flowing to the flames the first dawn after the attacks , the civilian crew was joined by robert lenney , 65 , who had spent 16 years at the helm of the john j harvey as a pilot in the fire department s marine division mr lenney called the moment bittersweet for it to take something like this for the city to realize it needed her is not nice , he said but it was good to be there photos the john j harvey , a decommissioned fireboat , had a long history in new york harbor , including fighting a 1932 fire at cunard s north river pier 54 at 14th street \( fred r conrad the new york times \) \( collection of al trojanowicz \)

hempstead , ny , nov 2 they regard themselves as tough guys who think it is a major reason the same five players have started every game on the jets' offensive line since the start of last season for the offense to produce the big plays coach herman edwards wants , they must control the point of attack but sunday night in new orleans , the offensive line will have a different look , with j p machado playing right guard for randy thomas , who has an ankle injury i think i 've been in two games , maybe three , said machado , in his third season after being a sixthround draft pick machado will be matched against the pro bowl tackle la'roi glover , who led the nfl last season with 17 sacks , the secondhighest total ever recorded by an interior lineman in the 23 games the line played together , the jets posted a 1310 mark the jets \( 43 \) will close the first half of this season hoping machado will fit in i pray for him , center kevin mawae said , trying to be facetious no , really , he s held accountable for his job we 're the only unit on the entire team that has to rely on the guy on either side of you on thursday nights , the offensive line conducts a kangaroo court at a local restaurant as a way to keep the unit together none of the players are allowed to speak of it when asked about it , mawae said gruffly , what kangaroo court \? on the day of a game , the offensive line is the first group of players in the locker room on mondays , every member of the line , including the backups , comes in early to discuss the game they sit in a circle in a corner of the room and talk things over machado will be sandwiched between mawae and right tackle ryan young the left side is anchored by tackle jason fabini and guard kerry jenkins machado said he had not had much of a chance to show what he could do not even in practice i 've had zero reps at center or guard with the first unit , he said in preseason , i had a few machado , who played at illinois , was impressed by the toughness of the line , and by thomas in particular no one ever wants to sit out , even in practice , machado said that s why we do n't kid randy about not playing no one questions him there is probably more peer pressure on a player like machado than on backups on other units machado says he always watches film as if he were a starter so this week , he is not looking at extra footage of glover or the saints' defense he will do what he always does i always spent a lot of time studying , machado said i do n't want to be the guy to mess things up if they call me edwards has not gone out of his way to talk to machado i 've kind of left him alone , edwards said maybe i 'll whisper a few words to him in the weight room he 'll be fine he got his nose bloodied last week when he replaced thomas , and he did a pretty good job extra points because the wonlost record , not style points , counts in the standings , the jets \( 43 \) would play the miami dolphins in the playoffs if the season ended now the jets have an excellent division and conference record \( 31 \) after the saints game , the jets' schedule will include only american conference teams , including four against division rivals coach herman edwards said he did not know wayne chrebet \( 15 catches \) was questioning why he had not caught more passes we 'll try to get him the ball this week , edwards said
here are glimpses of some of the victims of the sept 11 attack on the world trade center peggy alario time for her sons because peggy alario s bronco was always the first one in the commuter lot and the last out , her friends on staten island staved off alarm as the hours passed on sept 11 and her little green truck was still parked there but mrs alario , a manager at zurich american insurance company , had been at a meeting on the 105th floor of 2 world trade center with only a high school diploma and some college courses , mrs alario , 41 , put in 12hour days and sundays , proudly building a career that had her working on national and international corporate policies her most successful partnership , however , was her 18year marriage to james , who worked at home so he could watch their two sons i did everything around the house for her so she would n't have to worry and could spend time with the boys , said mr alario of his vivacious , outgoing wife , whom he met on the dance floor and who still loved dancing at rod stewart concerts mrs alario always got home for the final little league innings , to supervise homework and put the boys to bed , making the sign of the cross over their foreheads only then would she put on running shoes and tool around the neighborhood for a good 45 minutes she worked so hard so we could retire early together , mr alario said ramzi doany ways to amass friends ramzi doany amassed friends he amassed them with acts of kindness , like tutoring a woman with lupus , two children and no husband , to get her through college , or letting his college roommate and the roommate s wife live in his condo for two years so they could save money for a down payment on a house he amassed friends with his sense of humor , which filled a room and flourished at an early age as a boy of 9 or 10 , young ramzi dug a hole in the backyard for a terrible report card and put a stone on top he said it was dead and buried , said his sister , dina doany azzam mr doany was born to palestinian parents in amman , jordan , and lived for many years in milwaukee at 35 , he devoured the novels of dickens , cooked thanksgiving turkeys with great pride \( even if they were just a bit dry \) and had just bought a harleydavidson motorcycle he chose to work as a forensic accountant last march for marsh mclennan , the insurance brokerage company , because it would bring him to new york , a city he loved the job also brought him to the world trade center it was a funny sort of journey , his sister said jacquelyn aldridge the sister connection jacquelyn aldridge s family called her the connector , because she was the one who always knew what everyone was up to ms aldridge grew up in tampa but moved to staten island in 1979 , joining a sister who was living there at the time she worked as an accountant for marsh mclennan , and was in constant touch with her two sisters and brother , even though none of them lived in new york she was always one of those who pulled folks together , said her oldest sister , delores p aldridge , who lives in atlanta their parents , who always emphasized to their children that they should get good educations , died in the 90 s the siblings remained close delores aldridge said she talked to jackie , as her family called their youngest sibling , once or twice a week jackie aldridge married three years ago , to lafayette fredericks , and continued living in staten island she would have turned 47 this month , said her longtime friend , stephanie wright she was someone who raced to take advantage of everything new york city had to offer jazz concerts , plays , new restaurants i used to tease her that she was a girl from tampa who got new yorkanized , ms wright said jeffrey wiener a proposal in a toy store jeffrey and heidi wiener became engaged at fao schwarz , in front of the big clock the couple had first gone to the toy store on an early date , when they were living in philadelphia , where they met we were taking the elevator down and he told me he knew that someday we would bring our kids there , mrs wiener recalled a few years later , when they were visiting new york because mr wiener was running in the new york city marathon , he took her to fao schwarz again , and asked her to marry him i laughed and i cried and i hugged him and somewhere in there i said 'yes , ' she said and then we went for a carriage ride in central park mr wiener , 33 , could be serious and studious he had degrees in aerospace engineering and business from princeton , the university of pennsylvania and new york university but he never forgot how to have fun he grew up in trumbull , conn , and was manager of the risktechnologies group at marsh mclennan for mr wiener and his wife , another favorite spot was just a few blocks from fao schwarz the central park zoo he used to say that if he ever won the lottery , he would spent time working at the zoo or an aquarium , she said he loved animals george

jalacte , belize , jan 10 ever since british pirates and spanish colonists argued over the lush land of belize , the frontier between it and guatemala has been as squishy as the redclay hillside paths that traverse this border area every day , guatemalan peasants cross over to this village in belize to work the bean and corn fields , trudging past belizean farmers leading donkeys laden with sacks of grain that they will sell in guatemala the only distinct lines between the two countries are the rolling furrows of farmland carved , belizean officials say , by guatemalan peasants who invade their territory and practice slashandburn farming , destroying the environment as they clear land and haul away trees to sell in guatemala meanwhile , desperate peasants who include more than 220 squatters in two villages discovered in the last month in protected forest reserves north of here continue their search for land that is a scant resource in their homeland , the peten region across the border nobody knows where the line is , said santos pop , a belizean who like many of the area s residents is a maya , and often makes the halfhour walk from jalacte to visit friends in santa cruz , a border town in guatemala the people say it is here but nobody really knows where it is but the law knows the law will be invoked by both sides on tuesday , when negotiators meet in miami with the organization of american states to discuss a solution to the dispute over the two recently discovered villages the debate has prompted nationalistic outrage from highranking guatemalan officials and peasant advocates , who have ominously declared that they will defend their rights belizean officials , who decided last week not to uproot the squatters so that tensions might ease , have fretted over the incursions and jingoistic talk , which is part of a larger debate over guatemala s claim to some 4 , 633 square miles of land that it insists was improperly ceded to the british in 1859 indeed , many guatemalans believe that belize , the former british honduras , which became independent in 1981 , is rightfully theirs over the years , members of belize s tiny army have repeatedly evicted squatters inside the protected areas , leading to the deaths of three guatemalans in past confrontations in some cases , villages straddle the borderline , like one where the soccer field is neatly bisected , making every game a contest between the two countries as tensions have grown , many belizeans say they feel that all the flagwaving and saberrattling have been used by guatemalan leaders to divert attention from their failure to meet demands for land reform and economic opportunity promised indigenous people in the 1996 peace accords that ended guatemala s 36year civil war there are certain elements in the peten who have decided they would incite the poor people by telling them that they are living in guatemala and should not move , and that belize has no right to remove them , said said musa , the prime minister of belize they project to the international community that we are harassing the poor peasants , he said the truth is , they are illegal settlers who have pushed into belize the fact is , these poor people ca n't get land in the peten there is plenty of fallow land in belize , much of it virgin forest that is among the 40 percent of national territory under official protection across the border , in the peten , similar forests have vanished over the years , with more destroyed each dry season as the fires set by peasants to prepare their corn fields burn out of control with many of the farms in the peten owned by large landholders , often with ties to the military peasants have increasingly invaded guatemala s own national parks the exodus has continued into belize , where landuse maps show bulges of farmland intruding into forest like small bumps along an otherwise razorsharp line this has been going on since my grandparents were children , said wil maheia , the director of the toledo institute for development and the environment , which already has been successfully stopping poaching by guatemalan fishermen the problem is their guatemalan population is exploding , he said the resources in belize are abundant it is human nature that they come to where the grass is greener while we still have grass mr maheia s worry was evident on a recent journey to the border , where the forests give way to hill after hill of new farms along the roadside , men with machetes walked in single file , ready to work land that will produce two season s worth of crops before running out of nutrients and being left to erode i am guatemalan and i came here in 1982 , said esteban caal , a farmer in jalacte who became a citizen of belize last year more are coming it is because of the need for land there is none to work in guatemala the rich have the land we have nothing guatemalan peasants have accused the belize defense force of harassing them and removing them illegally from what they insisted were guatemalan towns in one recent case , when belize s army took down a guatemalan flag that was flying over land it said was within belize , guatemalan officials demanded its return and provided a military escort complete with bands as the banner was brought back to the capital officials from both governments agreed last year to an oassponsored set of measures to declare one kilometer on either side of the border as an adjacency zone where no one would be evicted until the two countries better define the border the process also allows for belize to evict any new villages settled after october 2000 , and to set up a procedure for notification , verification and deportation this is the first time we have ever had a political consensus to solve the problem with belize , and we need to take advantage of this unique opportunity to negotiate , said foreign minister gabriel orellana rojas of guatemala while some people have said the government calls attention to this issue to avoid dealing with other problems , he added , i think in the long term it is in both governments' best interest to take advantage of this opportunity and put an end to the dispute however , the discovery of the two villages has stalled the process , with both sides claiming hidden motives some in belize say the incursions are part of an attempt to provoke a military clash guatemalans , in turn , accuse belize of the same thing , though belize s military consists of a mere 600 men a violent reaction from guatemala would be a blessing for them because it would mean the return of british troops and an economic boost , said mr orellana rojas they constantly paint the guatemalan government as violent and corrupt while mr orellana rojas insisted that his country would not resort to military force , belize s prime minister , mr musa , expressed puzzled concern it is not in our interest in our relations with the british and the americans to be seen as causing any provocation in any situation , he said the strength of belize s territorial integrity and sovereignty is based on being able to maintain international support for the justness of our cause there is no way we would endanger that by engaging in any adventurous exercises it makes no sense for the foreign minister to speak along those lines one diplomat who has been monitoring the talks said military confrontation would be unwinnable for belize and unwise for guatemala it would be an inappropriate move internationally because nobody recognizes guatemala s claim except guatemala , the diplomat said map of belize shows the location of jalacte residents of jalacte often walk across the border into guatemala
huntington station if a tree falls in the forest , joseph murray might not hear it but if a tree comes down in a long island backyard , there s a good chance he is listening most lumberjacks harvest trees from vast corporateowned forests mr murray s trees come from the backyards of suburbia his company , forest for tomorrow in huntington station , takes hardwood timber cut down from long island homes , construction sites and road projects and sells almost all of the logs overseas , where they are made into furniture , cabinets , paneling and flooring before mr murray s suburban logging efforts , almost all of the trees cleared for home and roadbuilding on long island ended up as landfill or firewood but there is a lumber market hungry for the prime hardwoods that thrive east of the mississippi , proving that , mr murray said , sometimes money does grow on trees last year , he recovered nearly 15 million board feet of lumber here mr murray has paid a homeowner up to 300 for a clear , knotfree trunk but he gets many of his logs free from tree service companies , land clearers or construction crews who are just happy to avoid paying a carting or landfill fee and with some hardwoods like cherry or walnut fetching retail prices of 15 a foot for finished lumber , the logs can roll out a tidy profit the mature suburban trees sought by mr murray are known as oldgrowth virgin timber and produce logs that dwarf those coming out of conventional forestry operations while an averagesized long island oak log can be turned into a 10by10foot floor , a front door and a little bit left over for furniture , one large long island tree can floor as many as 40 10by10 rooms , equaling the yield of a tractortrailer load full of timber from a logging company mr murray said that one behemoth he had handled was a northern red oak taken from the harriman estate in sands point estimated at more than 300 years old , the tree was more than 160 feet tall and had to be cut into four pieces to be transported there is no company from the midatlantic to new england that produces the same size logs as we here on long island , mr murray said the quality is second to none some of the local logs he has exported , he said , have ended up as decorations at foreign lumber mills because they were too big to cut mr murray s first experience with long island hardwood came when he used a handsaw to cut logs and branches for firewood at his family s home in huntington bay later , as a log buyer for lumber mills , he traveled the timber states of the appalachian corridor and became versed in grading the different types of trees although about 75 percent of the local hardwood trees are red or black oak , there is also cherry , maple , walnut , white oak , birch , gum and tulip poplar clear red or black oak retails for between 5 and 8 a foot red oak is more desirable and used for paneling white oak is used for flooring and marine work because of its durability tulip poplar is used in andersen window frames , and black birch is used for doors in the past , domestic mills would routinely reject a good portion of what loggers delivered to them , opting to pick and choose through truckloads of lumber but demand from abroad has changed selective buying , because overseas mills will take whole shipments , even with lower grades thrown in now , mr murray said , american mills have become a lot less picky doug harned , the owner of the island s last remaining sawmill , said his company , harned brothers in commack , used to buy almost all of its hardwood logs from suppliers upstate but lately , he said , about half of his timber comes from right here oak is in very high demand , said mr harned , whose mill opened in the 1930 s and produces a variety of soft and hardwood lumber i 'll buy logs from anyone but not joe murray , who would rather avoid haggling over individual logs about 95 percent of mr murray s customers are from other countries the long island logs are trucked to port in montreal , baltimore and port elizabeth , nj , loaded into 40foot containers and shipped to countries like japan , south korea , italy and france mr murray estimated that hardwood timber that would yield 20 million board feet of usable lumber \( a board foot is 12 inches square and an inch thick \) was felled on long island each year , with most of it being used as firewood or going to waste he has been lobbying local agencies to make sure downed trees are no longer wasted the recent long island building boom has been a good source of hardwood logs for mr murray new home construction on a sevenacre site in lattingtown yielded 170 , 000 board feet of virgin timber a hotel and housing site for the elderly in woodbury brought over 120 , 000 feet and a subdivision off shelter rock road in manhasset with a view of the manhattan skyline netted 200 , 000 feet another lumber windfall came with the expansion of the long island expressway over the last two years matt ress , the owner of beaver industries in hauppauge , which cleared the land for the lie project , alerted mr murray , who jumped at the chance to claim the hardwood bounty he s one of a kind , said mr ress you call him up and he s right there there are other people who sell logs , but joe has taken it to the next level eddie meyer , general foreman for conservatree , a tree service in huntington station , is another supplier for mr murray currently clearing some 200 trees at the nissequogue country club , mr meyer is glad the timber will be put to good use before , the trees went to the dump or were cut up for firewood , he said mr meyer said that local restrictions on tree cutting in villages and towns like lloyd harbor , matinecock and the brookvilles limited hardwood harvesting you have to go through a whole political process and sometimes wait three weeks for a permit , he said but that s good it keeps out the flybynight guys mr murray said that although most of his trees come from 10 miles east or west of his huntington station yard , he had gone as far as brooklyn and bridgehampton to take trees forest for tomorrow has recently expanded its operation to providence , ri , and also covers parts of northern new jersey and the boston suburbs the goal here is conservation , and the greening of long island , mr murray said people need to realize what a valuable resource these trees are let s put them to good use photos joe murray , left , whose company , forest for tomorrow in huntington station , harvests trees from homes , construction sites and road projects , marks and grades trees trees , above , being loaded on flatbed trucks mr murray says long island is known for big trees \( photographs by phil marino for the new

the director brad anderson was living in the boston area when he first noticed an enormous , abandoned state mental hospital looming over the nearby city of danvers , mass it was an edifice with true cinematic potential , as terrifying as the overlook hotel in the shining or the dakota apartment building in rosemary s baby that was all it took for him to come up with the idea for the chilling tale of psychological horror , session 9 , which opens on friday his first movie since the quirky 1998 romance next stop wonderland \( later this month he has another movie opening , happy accidents , a timetravel romantic comedy starring marisa tomei and vincent d'onofrio , which could not be more different from either \) the genesis of session 9' was the place itself , says mr anderson , 36 , a tall , lanky , affable man who does not seem the type to write and direct a twisted horror movie i wanted to have the movie set on one location and let the building and the vibe there set the tone combining elements from real life , as well as from their imaginations , the film was written by mr anderson with steve gevedon , 35 , a friend and former classmate who is also a costar the cast is led by david caruso , peter mullan , josh lucas and brendan sexton iii session 9 , a kind of blair witch project for grownups , begins as a deceptively simple tale about a small team of workers removing asbestos from the danvers state hospital but as the crew settles in to do their job , they are slowly overwhelmed by the building s dark , disturbing aura mr anderson and mr gevedon , who met as students at bowdoin college in brunswick , me , borrowed one aspect of the plot from a horror story that made headlines in boston in 1995 richard rosenthal , then a 40yearold executive at john hancock financial services , beat his wife to death and impaled her heart and lungs on a stake in their suburban backyard it was believed that mr rosenthal had never recovered from the death of his infant son the year before in session 9 , mr mullan s character is a middleaged man coping with the demands of a wife , a faltering business and a newborn baby girl the movie is a somewhat cautionary tale , mr anderson says like , if you want a family and a kid , be sure you 're ready for it the characters in session 9 are none too stable to begin with they are spooked even further by the eerie artifacts left over from more than a century of often primitive methods of treating the mentally ill the actors , too , were affected during the 22day shoot mr mullan sometimes pressed his head into a wall almost to absorb the creepy vibe of the place , mr anderson says mr gevedon recalls no one i knew wandered very far off from our little group if we went too far away from each other , we 'd start to get done in by the heaviness of the place mr anderson did not have to look far for props surgical tables and the remnants of hydrotherapy tubs have been left as they were at the hospital , which was abandoned in 1992 there was a whole basement full of cardboard boxes of patients' records , mr anderson says , recalling the scene over coffee at a greenwich village restaurant near his home all these intimate details of people s lives just lying around among the dictation and xerox machines , still functioning , were old reeltoreel tape recorders that had been used to document sessions with patients in the movie , mr gevedon s character finds such a tape recorder in the basement and starts listening to the haunting dialogue between a doctor and a patient with multiple personalities the tape recorder in the film actually came from the hospital , but mr anderson made up the psychiatric session by researching multiplepersonality disorder on the internet thank god for the web , he says it s the greatest research tool in the world the building , however , exacted its price mr anderson reports that several strange incidents took place while filming the most bizarre involved the german cinematographer uta briesewitz ms briesewitz was in one of the subterranean hallways of the hospital , running behind the actor josh lucas as he fled as mr lucas rounded a corner , he knocked over a 1950 sera dental drill , which had a giant arm with a hook and a probe sticking out one end the drill fell on ms briesewitz , and the probe penetrated about an inch into her right eye socket , just missing her eyeball the accident eerily mimicked a scene in the movie in which one character playfully demonstrates how to perform a prefrontal lobotomy by pointing out exactly where the surgical pick would go it was a bizarre experience , mr anderson says it was like the building was warning us fortunately , ms briesewitz s injury was less severe than it might have been in great part because the end of the probe was round , not sharp she was taken to the hospital but was well enough to work the next day ms briesewitz says she feels lucky but wonders why it happened brad and i walked around the building a lot , but i feel we were never disrespectful , she says the walls there are very sad full of hurt it s not a place you take lightly

jason williams was on his high school chess team he also decided to take up volleyball in his senior year , and bided his time on the bench for weeks until he finally rounded into allcounty form he adopted a rottweiler and named him duke , and when it became clear that basketball and academics were consuming most of his time , he asked his parents to take care of the puppy his car , the batmobile , is famous on the duke campus in durham , nc , for its faulty muffler , which heralds his arrival long before he gets there he is a terrible loser , whether it is in a game of gin rummy or on the basketball floor none of these details , however , illuminate how williams , a sophomore point guard , has become the most talked about player in the ncaa men s basketball tournament but they do explain why david and althea williams have fended off agents and wouldbe confidants who suggest that their son is ready for a professional career and its millions of dollars no matter how grown up williams s tournament performances have been heading into duke s national semifinal matchup with maryland on saturday , he was averaging 28 points a game , shooting 48 percent from the field and 44 percent from the 3point line to her he is still , well , a boy he is n't a sensation , but he has played sensationally , althea williams said of her and david s only child he is only 19 , and we want him to enjoy being a kid i would n't trade my college years , when i was skinny enough to wear my hot pants and platform shoes , for anything williams was a high school all american , but the whole family worked hard to get him there it meant a grinding summer between his junior and senior year , attending one basketball camp after another and driving sometimes three times a week between the williamses' home in plainfield , nj , and amateur athletic union tournaments and practices along the east coast my parents are the kind of people who make you feel like you can do anything you want and then give you the support to achieve it as long as you work hard , williams said and you can never stop working as a college freshman , williams shot 35 percent and averaged 145 points a game after he wore out the court last spring with steve wojciechowski , an assistant coach and former blue devil point guard , and spent the summer playing with a united states select team , he raised his scoring average this season to 216 points in the williams home , the creed has always been hard work and balance lead to opportunity david williams , a director of marketing for a telemarketing firm , was one of 10 siblings to earn a college degree althea williams , a guidance instructor at hillsborough \( nj \) high school , just completed her second master s degree , in education administration at kean university , so she can pursue a vice principal s position what we 've tried to teach jason is that one day you wo n't be able to run up and down the court that knowledge is the key , she said as a high school student at st joseph s in metuchen , nj , it was just as important for jason williams to play chess , write poetry , persevere on the bench in volleyball and compete diligently in his studies to become a member of the national honor society as it was to be a basketball star if you did n't know that he was the best player on the basketball court and future nba star , you 'd think he was a good solid citizen , said mark taylor , the st joseph s coach , whose team was 7823 over four years with williams and runnerup twice in the state s parochial a championships he was n't condescending or arrogant he had friends outside basketball a lot of different kinds of kids wanted to be around him coming out of high school , williams was not terribly interested in exploring his options he wanted to stay close to home and attend rutgers he did not even want to take a planned recruiting visit to duke his mother made him get in the car on a rainy day for the sevenhour drive to durham , nc for about five and a half hours of the trip , althea said , her son would not talk to her you can be a man among boys or a man among men , she told her son if you have the talent , you have to compete against the mcdonald s allamericans , the mr basketballs , and test out your talent i raised him not to care for him the rest of life , but to lead a prosperous , wholesome life after seeing or hearing about the blue devils' winning tradition , coach mike krzyzewski s emphasis on a family atmosphere and a diverse campus , and after a spirited pickup game against william avery , then duke s point guard , his parents' lessons took hold shane battier , the senior star of this year s team , watched williams go after avery on the court and was impressed this kid is going to be good , he thought i did n't know he 'd be this good this quick williams had to be instead of easing into a college career , he was suddenly a starter because avery joined elton brand and corey maggette and became one of the first duke underclassmen to enter the national basketball association draft i think so many kids when they choose a college , they look and say , 'well , i'm not going to start' or , 'oh man , i'm not going to get a lot of minutes' i do n't think a lot of kids look at a college and say , 'when i leave here , i'm going to be the man i want to become' i can say that williams insists he is not ready to leave duke early he likes the fact that students not just basketball players smile when he pulls up on campus in the batmobile he likes the card games with his teammates on the road he likes telling his mom that when he gets a bill , i send it home i still have a lot of growing up to do , he said there s so much more to the game than just putting the ball in the basket just learning and being a leader , being around a coach there s nothing that can make you better than that in late january , the williamses , tired of overtures from agents , discussed jason s immediate future jason met with krzyzewski , then david williams spoke with the coach on feb 4 , jason announced that he would remain a blue devil for four years the decision was , althea said , leave me alone i'm going to get my degree this is the plan these are the rules if we do anything , it will be under the advisement of coach k his mother still remembers the second grader who , after getting sent home from school with a critical note about his behavior , was sent upstairs to prepare for a spanking he came down with two pairs of pants , a snow suit , gloves and helmet , she recalled i decided that my kid is going to play chess with me for the rest of my life , she said , adding with a laugh that he never received that spanking even if althea williams once challenged her son to be a man among men on the basketball court , she knows he remains a boy among boys she still has his dog she has been on the other end of the phone when he has been homesick i'm so blessed that all i 've had to do was try to run him off a basketball court rather than running him off a corner , she said i know he s not perfect i also know he s got plenty of time before he needs to go to work let him grow up photos althea williams , at home with her son jason s awards , says , he is only 19 , and we want him to enjoy being a kid \( jill c becker for the new york times \) jason williams ,

every architecture competition has the potential to force a crisis in evaluation periodically , the standards by which buildings are judged should themselves be placed on trial one recent new york competition holds far greater potential than most to compel an appraisal of critical standards indeed , it has given us a chance to see that a crisis in evaluation is not a bad thing provoking such calamities , and uncovering their causes , is one of the most useful cultural tasks a modern city can perform we are accustomed to begin evaluating the contents of a period of architecture on the assumption that in relation to the society which built it , it was right , john summerson writes in his 1970 book , victorian architecture four studies in evaluation where the victorians are concerned , it would be very much safer to begin , at least , on the assumption that it was wrong early and midvictorian architecture was , in its own time and in the eyes of its bestinformed critics , horribly unsuccessful the new york competition , for the design of a master plan for a nineacre site along the east river formerly owned by consolidated edison , began , in the developers' words , as a global search for ideas the finalists included toyo ito \( japan \) , rem koolhaas \( the netherlands \) , christian de portzamparc \( france \) , and richard meier and peter eisenman \( both of new york \) but when the results were announced , none of these illustrious names were to be found instead , leadership was awarded to two local corporate firms , skidmore owings merrill and pei cobb freed it is not likely that they won it on the basis of ideas one does not turn to corporate firms for ideas one turns to them for risk management , proven track records and the myth of corporate efficiency i approach the con ed competition with summerson in mind because a useful analogy can be made between the period he was writing about and new york architecture in recent years our buildings , too , have been judged in their own time and in the eyes of their bestinformed critics to be horribly unsuccessful socalled contextualism the idea that new buildings should fit in with their surroundings rather than add to them has led our architecture into the deadest of dead ends it is too early to conclude that the con ed site architects will be compelled to beat their heads against contextualism s blank if picturesque wall but the program book issued for the competition offers no encouragement to architects seeking to go beyond the contextual dispensation instead , it supports respect for the context of existing building forms and and the surrounding neighborhood , as emphasized by the city s zoning resolution the book s vision statement further proposes an architecture inspired by the best of the city s traditions tudor city is explicitly mentioned the guidelines highlight the need for architects to mediate between the developers and civic groups and community associations precisely the groups that have helped keep new york architecture at its startlingly provincial level skidmore owings merrill , which is expected to take the lead role in the project , is highly valued for its skill in mediating with these groups in short , it s riverside south redux , folks ideally , the con ed competition might have made it possible to develop and compare creative responses should n't a competition of ideas produce a range of alternative visions \? unfortunately , the developers have so far declined to make the competitors' sketchbooks publicly available it is still possible , however , to analyze the crisis in the evaluation we now face why was victorian architecture wrong for its time \? because it contradicted the standards by which the victorians themselves judged buildings this was the age of historicism , the idea that the great civilizations of the past had each produced its own distinctive style judged by this standard , however , the victorian age could not have been great instead of producing a style of their own , its architects merely recycled ornamental motifs from earlier periods the problem remained unresolved , at least in theory , until the advent of the modern movement in the early 20th century modern architects believed they had transcended the issue of style by eliminating ornament altogether , thus collapsing the distinction between architecture and building their designs , based on the functional principles of engineering , were meant to embody the spirit of the industrial age correct or not , these intentions at least provided architects with a yardstick against which individual buildings could be measured alas , it turned out that the problem did n't rest with style but with the historicist view of it who cares whether a civilization produces a distinctive formal vocabulary \? who says that history is represented by a mainstream \? who cares about artistic progress , historicism s wayward child \? these were 19thcentury european concepts , not timeless , universal ones more than a century after the industrial revolution , who cared if buildings looked industrial \? who needs a universal yardstick , for that matter \? far from breaking with the 19th century , modern architects dragged it into the 20th
new york woke up to another day yesterday , but it was n't another day it could n't possibly be it was a city of less less traffic , less noise , fewer people , less activity , less momentum , less certainty , less joy the dawn did not erase the preceding day s agony no dawn could and so new yorkers ate their meals , did the dishes and put out the trash , the mundane tasks of life , but nothing felt the same the city seemed ever so much more fragile and unfamiliar on a day when work meant so much less than family and human companionship , when the very constructs of what it meant to live in new york came under question , new yorkers spent much of their time in somber and heartfelt reflection the most glaring difference yesterday , of course , was less skyline no one could glance downtown without feeling chills from the absence of the trade center towers but in countless smaller ways , the reassuring signposts of daily life were not there it was a city of quiet people who lived near the city s busy airports , accustomed to the repetitive earsplitting roar of jets arriving and departing , awoke to a day of uncomfortable silence smaller sounds resounded , for the bigger ones were gone traffic was sparse , and sirens , one of the background noises of city life , seemed so much louder and more ominous than ever before it was a city of lonely commutes richard m morris s workday always begins when he squeezes onto metronorth s final rush hour train at crotononhudson , the last express stop before manhattan the train is usually a sardine can by then , people having boarded on the succession of earlier stops mr morris , a corporate lawyer , barely finds room for his 6foot3 frame but when he took the train yesterday morning , he had rows of seats to himself even the front car , typically crammed with those eager to conserve a few precious commuting steps , was just about empty mr morris continued his routine yesterday out of willpower rather than need his office was closed he did not need to come in the one thing you know the terrorists want is to disrupt our lives , he said i'm not going to give them that i'm trying to regain some normalcy it was a city of eerie contrasts on the upper west side , there was a powerful but artificial sense of another day in the morning , a playground in riverside park teemed with children playing on swings and in sandboxes in the sparkling sunshine , under the watchful eyes of parents along the promenade , people sat reading the papers , biking and skating but there was an odd hush smiles were rare by the time one gravitated down to west 55th street , the complexion changed suddenly , there was the evacuated , closely protected aura of a war zone police checkpoints and barricades appeared along the bikeway and the west side highway , continuing all the way to lower manhattan traffic vanished one could travel for blocks and see only a city bus or an occasional taxi lower manhattan , had the feel of an abandoned town everything closed the streets and sidewalks nearly empty it was a city of postponements it was matinee day on broadway shows in the afternoon and evening but all the theaters were dark nothing at the golden or the imperial or the shubert nothing at the luntfontanne or the palace performances canceled due to circumstances beyond our control two middleaged women studied the notice on the door of the luntfontanne , where beauty and the beast usually plays , and one said , no , no show today her friend said i did n't think so how could there be a show \? who would show up \? who could perform \? no one journeyed to the observation deck of the empire state building to look at the stunning cityscape the entire building was shut down the stock exchange tape on the side of the morgan stanley offices at broadway and 48th street reported no stock trades there were none to report instead , there was information on an employee assistance phone line and pleas to give blood no parents had to rise early and bundle their children off to school there was no school some classmates arranged their own little gatherings to bond and distract themselves from events beyond their comprehension it was not a day for shopping so many stores were closed entirely , not sure when they would open on the doors of the virgin megastore in times square , a notice said simply , we are closed until further notice macy s herald square , the world s biggest store , was open , but the aisles were thin in the late morning the gap across the street was closed outside , a halfdozen police officers ate sandwiches and drank from jugs of water propped on a parked car barbers sat idly outside barber shops , talking quietly it was not a day to get one s hair cut midtown parking lots , usually bursting with cars , sat nearly empty on 37th street , between eighth and ninth avenues , was a row of parking lots , promoting their exquisite convenience to madison square garden , macy s , the fashion district and the convention center any weekday found them packed with cars in the late morning an attendant at sr parking said he had 11 cars , all monthlies no day parkers had arrived normally , there would be 71 cars , he said
when jeanclaude baker , the owner of chez josephine , got the letter , he was , he said , devastated it was a restaurateur s nightmare a patron celebrating his wedding anniversary a columbia professor no less said he had been sickened extended nausea , vomiting , diarrhea and abdominal cramps all pointed to one thing food poisoning , the letter said our special romantic evening became reduced to my wife watching me curl up in a fetal position on the tiled floor of our bathroom between rounds of throwing up , the letter , on columbia business school stationery from frank flynn , professor of organizational behavior , went on chez josephine s chef , marvin james , was , if anything , even more heartbroken my ego was hurt i thought we had let jeanclaude down , mr james said i ripped my cooks apart unknown to the chez josephine crew , similar scenes were being played out at restaurants all over town 240 of them , columbia now says that received the identically worded , totally fictitious letter from professor flynn as part of a study to determine how they responded to complaints it was culinary chaos as owners , managers and chefs searched through computers for professor flynn s reservations or credit card records , reviewed menus and produce deliveries for possibly spoiled food , and questioned kitchen workers about possible lapses , all spurred by what both the university and the professor now concede was the business school study from hell on thursday , bicycle messengers made the rounds of all the 240 restaurants chez josephine , le bernardin , gotham bar and grill , judson grill , bolo , mesa grill , az , 26 seats and all the rest with a formal letter of apology from the dean of the business school , meyer feldberg it was , professor feldberg wrote , an egregious error in judgment by a junior faculty member that was part of an illconceived research project the letter went on to say that while the professor initiated this research project on his own , he failed to think through the toll this study would take on its recipients the 240 restaurants also received a second letter from professor flynn on plain paper this time written to sincerely apologize for the horrible mistake that i have made the first letter was fabricated to help collect data for a research study that i designed concerning vendor response to consumer complaints , professor flynn explained the study was of my own doing and not that of the business school or of the university , he added none of the data collected for the study will be used for publication , and i will not conduct similar studies in the future in his original letter sent to all the restaurants in midaugust , after graphically describing his supposed symptoms and spoiled anniversary , professor flynn wrote , although it is not my intention to file any reports with the better business bureau or the department of health , i want you , mr baker , he named each restaurateur here , to understand what i went through in anticipation that you will respond accordingly i await your response professor feldberg said the matter had taken up almost all his time , in a flurry of meetings and memorandums , after he returned from vacation on monday night it s awful , it s awful , he said yesterday afternoon what can i say \? what will happen to professor flynn \? he was asked clearly the issue is being very thoroughly reviewed and investigated , the dean said grimly professor flynn did not respond to messages left yesterday on his office answering machine and at home distraught by the letter , mr james , the chef at chez josephine , in the theater district , drilled his staff in the gleaming new kitchen customdesigned by larry bogdanow as part of a 500 , 000 renovation hammering home all the standards hot sauces held hot , cold sauces held cold when to ice the cutting boards bleached overnight and after chicken and fish this could be the kiss of death for a restaurant , mr baker wailed it could be on the front page of the papers with the headline some famous guy from columbia university columbia , it s a worldfamous institution it s almost like the white house this was a very traumatizing experience but the more they examined the letter , the more mr baker and many of the other restaurateurs became suspicious for one thing , they said , the letter did not say when professor flynn had supposedly eaten dinner more important , it did not say what he had eaten while food poisoning cases are extremely rare , they said , someone who complains will almost always specify a dish and , there were no complaints that anyone else had been sickened , as there would be if an ingredient had been contaminated the suspicions hardened as no records of professor flynn s reservation , table number or payment turned up in the computers i am an old fox , mr baker explained in a thick french accent nevertheless , in part to draw him out , he wrote a courteous letter to professor flynn offering a refund and a meal with his wife as mr baker s guests in hopes you will have the enchanting event you anticipated it was one of 60 replies to the original letter , professor feldberg said at least one , he added , alleged fraud , prompting the university s investigation kim huskey , the general manager at judson grill in midtown , said that when she saw professor flynn s letter , i was really shocked , i showed it to the chef ms huskey said if somebody calls in and said they got sick , that s really bad i was upset i think it was a terrible thing he did , she added some people could have gotten in trouble , with screaming and yelling at le bernardin , the fourstar seafood restaurant in midtown , tito rahman , the assistant general manager , said he must have thought about it quite a lot because the letter is very good , very dramatic , and made us very upset we did a lot of research , going into dates of reservations and looking for table numbers and orders laurence kretchmer , a partner in mesa grill , was one of several restaurateurs who immediately suspected a ploy to get a free meal it had no date , no reference to anything suspicious , he said there were so many things that stood out indicating a scam photos frank flynn jeanclaude baker , who owns chez josephine , suspected that something was not quite right about a letter complaining of food poisoning \( krista niles the new york times \) \( pg b2 \)
four in all by nina payne illustrated by adam payne unpaged asheville , nc front street 1595 \( all ages \) to fro , fast slow written and illustrated by durga bernhard unpaged new york walker company 1595 \( ages 3 to 7 \) how shall we remain hopeful in such dark and troubled times \? we can tell children that the human impulse to build and create continues , and we can pay close attention to its many and various forms four in all , a modest book in size and appearance , is a big book on just such a theme moreover , it is a book that provides a good answer to the child s eternal , unspoken question who am i \? how will i fit into the world \? a little girl takes a dream journey out her front door the landscape ends at a bridge going off into the night sky crossing the bridge lands the child in a confusing dream world of jumbled objects , which she must somehow make order of it s a real mess , and she looks bewildered at first then , getting down to work , the girl starts using what s at hand to make a shelter watching from afar , we are aware that the world she has entered is full of danger enormous insects lurk nearby \( they seem huge and scary at first , though we realize later that this is only a trick of perspective \) the dream goes on the girl s completed house is sturdy outside and cozy inside and has an ample garden she announces her accomplishment from the roof by blowing proudly on a trumpet some animals hear the call and come over to join her bringing them in , she gives them a supper of bread and fruit thus fed and snugly housed , they form a friendly group the animals pick up musical instruments and play for her carried on the wind of their song , the dreaming child floats back to her own home , where her family waits for her with open arms adam payne uses a detailed collage of cut paper in lovely muted colors to create this tale , this world his contribution is enormous , since nina payne s simple poem consists of only 56 common nouns that every child knows , which could suggest an infinity of stories , or none at all eyes ears nose mouth east west north south oats wheat corn rye sun moon stars sky floor table chair bed yellow green blue red the story that adam payne has found among those simple nouns is one that grows in complexity with each rereading certain details seem significant , even teasingly enigmatic , but never forced for example , on her journey to the dream world the girl carries a lantern and a loaf of bread before she steps onto the bridge she passes an old woman \( is it her grandmother \? is it herself in old age \? \) who gathers from the fields around her the stuff of which bread is made the house that the girl builds turns out , in the end , to look just like the house she lives in with her family \( this last makes for a comforting visual symmetry that seems , like the rest of the book , just right \) and then there are all those fours four words on a spread , four directions the girl could have taken , four colors , four elements , four of everything mentioned in the poem there is even a neat multiple of four in the very size of the book \( eight by eight inches \) one senses a gentle guiding intelligence behind everything in the making of this foursquare little production the subtle , unforced message here is that even in a dark world we build , we plant , we paint , we make music and we love one another a final quiet astonishment awaits us and comes from the fact that this authorartist team , the poet nina payne and the illustrator adam payne , also happen to be mother and son it s nice to fantasize about the kind of agreeable family tie \( as well as the sympathetic linkage among author , artist and publisher \) that might produce a book like this one durga bernhard s to fro , fast slow is also aimed at the very young child living in a troubled world , but here it is specifically the split domain of those children who must pass back and forth between divorced parents bernhard s is a bright , lively and above all hopeful book about one such girl who must divide her time between her mother in the country and her citydwelling father while the text offers simple contrasting verbal concepts \( over under , low high , in out \) , the pictures show us rich visual contrasts of color and texture on the jacket the girl exuberantly flings out her arms and legs in the passage \( one might say the rift \) between two worlds , city and country the endpapers show two highways one on the left page , marked to mom s , passes through fields and forests and ends at a farm on the right , the road marked to dad s leads into the busy city this division and fracturing of the pictorial space continues through the book , but bernhard s art keeps the whole thing steady there is a solidity to the artist s forms and brushstrokes and a firm , bright boldness to each of her page designs what could easily have become pure chaos becomes a harmonious blending of disparate experiences the pictures invite young readers to notice the specific differences between two lifestyles while noting , also , that this child is really enjoying herself it is possible , this book quietly asserts , that there may actually be riches gained and experiences broadened by something as theoretically troubling as a divorce drawing detail of an illustration by adam payne from 'four in all
basketball finally returned to madison square garden last night , none of it worth waiting for from the knicks , who fell into the same hypnotic trance that marcus camby was understandably in days removed from his family s hostage ordeal in south windsor , conn , camby did n't get a rebound until the fourth quarter , by which point the somnambulant knicks were down by 20 points to the toronto raptors and soon to be counted out , 9474 start to finish , it was a strange , subdued night , the loudest cheer for patrick ewing , introduced in his courtside seat if actual games are the fans' sustenance , they could have starved counting down the four days plus to game 2 of this firstround playoff series , and then watching the knicks shoot 39 percent and be outrebounded by 4836 i 'd rather have the time before the series than once the series starts , jeff van gundy had said earlier he added that the potential of five games over an olympiclike 13 days could prevent the normal rhythm of a riveting competition from developing all in the name of telecasts that are increasingly not being watched that s the national basketball association these days , a onceglittering product that will try anything to get people s attention , including deafening noise in every arena , personalized dotcom services for all of humankind and the standard merchandising push that could clothe the population of china 20 times over anything but a steady and meaningful presentation of what this league used to do best , the game itself , for which a series of rule changes now follows every ratings downturn , the latest and most radical going into effect next season without even a trial run do n't get the knicks' coach going on this because , as van gundy said , when i start being honest , i get myself in trouble with my big mouth like all sports micromanagers , he will overstate things , but his love of the unembellished game is indisputable , and it s too bad he was left dangling by his coaching peers and by league officials after his god and golf commentary in new york magazine in symbolic ways , van gundy was on the mark and , beyond the support he did n't get , he deserved credit for having had the courage to express himself on a touchy subject the nba has run away from van gundy put himself in the unenviable position of seemingly campaigning against the players' right to gather religiously but his point had little to do with expression and everything to do with what a professional athlete or any performance employee owes his or her boss , as regards focus and preparation could , for argument s sake , the players hold chapel before the morning shootaround \? could they get to the garden at 5 30 pm , a halfhour before they are due in the locker room \? of course they could , but that would require a sacrifice of their own time better to intrude on the coach s and on the leaguedesignated news media s , and why not , if team and league are afraid to say no the nba was far more intrepid regarding mahmoud abdulrauf , when the little guard several years ago cited religious beliefs in refusing to stand for the national anthem abdulrauf , a muslim and part of a tiny nba minority , was infringing on no one , but he was deemed a publicrelations nuisance , so the league made him stop charlie ward , conversely , has for years used his professional work place as a pulpit , to the discomfort and chagrin of a number of teammates , among others no one in the knicks' front office , apparently , ever ordered him to confine his workplace passion to the game basketball should come first , yet when the nba has its own set of inverted priorities , when playoff continuity is sacrificed to a network s scheduling demands because of the fear of a smaller contract , the message is that the game itself is secondary , if not an afterthought beyond the fourday wait to reach game 2 , the knicks and the raptors will play once more over the next five days the world was created faster than it will take to complete this series , but it could also be the best thing the knicks have going for them , as they go against vince carter and the emerging alvin williams in toronto , the raptors riding the high of their first playoff victory in franchise history in another knicks playoff twist , the length of the series may be their best chance to get back the camby who had 18 rebounds in game 1 , the camby they 're going to need to escape the first round photo jeff van gundy \( barton silverman \)
seattle , june 30 the fire at joe romania chevrolet in eugene , ore , started just before 2 45 one morning in the spring nearly 30 chevrolet suburbans and tahoes were destroyed in the blaze , the second time in nine months that vehicles in the dealership s sportutility lot had been set afire the fire at ray a schoppert logging inc , in eagle creek , ore , also occurred between 2 and 3 am this one , on june 1 , near the site of a disputed timber sale in a federal forest , burned three logging trucks sometime in the night of june 10 , someone broke into a research farm owned by seminis inc , near twin falls , idaho , and ripped out hundreds of genetically altered pea plants these incidents share more than the fact that none has resulted in an arrest all three appear to be part of what federal authorities describe as a growing pattern of ecosabotage , or vandalism , that its anonymous perpetrators claim to have carried out in defense of the environment many of these attacks , which the authorities say are especially prevalent here in the pacific northwest , are relatively smallscale and fail to attract much attention many go unreported , for the companies involved are often reluctant to generate publicity that might make them a target all over again but even if less noticed than major acts of ecosabotage like the recent fire at a university of washington genetics research laboratory , the vandalism has quietly reshaped life for many small businesses , forcing a need for safety measures that would have once been unthinkable we 've had to beef up security so it looks like a prison around our greenhouses , said crystal fricker , president of pureseed testing company in canby , ore , which grows all kinds of grass seed the company installed a chainlink fence with razor wire , motion sensors and an alarm system after vandals broke into greenhouses on its 110acre property last june the intruders destroyed several research projects , stomped on the grass , spraypainted slogans like nature bites back and left behind golf balls marked with the letter a , the international anarchists' symbol pureseed was apparently singled out because of its experiments with a genetically modified form of grass that could be used for putting greens on golf courses a few days after the incident , an email message from a sender identifying itself as the anarchist golfing association claimed responsibility for the vandalism , which caused roughly 500 , 000 in damage grass , like industrial culture , is invasive and permeates every aspect of our lives , the message said while the golf trade journals claim that 'golf courses provide suitable habitat for wildlife , ' we see them as a destroyer of all things wild in a sign of the growing fears , even companies that say they do no geneticengineering research whatsoever are taking precautions at its plant in tangent , ore , barenbrug usa , a company that sells alfalfa and other turf and forage grasses , took down all signs that had the word research in them , even though the company conducts only traditional crossbreeding it kind of bothers you when you feel you 've got to keep out of the public eye , said bob richardson , supply manager at barenbrug and president of the oregon seed trade association , an industry group but there are people out there who do n't understand what s going on here , mr richardson said they think we 're working on some alfalfa plant that s going to expand and explode and eat downtown tangent the attacks are causing consternation not only for businesses , university researchers and law enforcement authorities but also for mainstream environmental groups , who fear that the vandalism is undermining legitimate grievances i loathe suv s i have deep concerns about genetic engineering , said chip giller , editor of www gristmagazine com , the online journal of the earth day network , based in seattle i understand the anger but these attacks are n't constructive , mr giller said they 're not winning any converts to the cause they 're not environmentalism they 're vandalism state and federal authorities say that in addition to the recent fires at the university of washington and on an oregon poplar farm , they are investigating at least a dozen other incidents of suspected ecosabotage in the northwest in recent months many of the acts are thought to be tied in some fashion to the earth liberation front , a loosely organized network of protesters after the fire at the car dealership in eugene , craig rosebraugh , who calls himself a spokesman for the north american earth liberation front press office , said he had received an anonymous communiqu from someone who claimed responsibility for the fire gasguzzling suv s are at the forefront of this vile , imperialistic culture s caravan towards selfdestruction , said the statement , which mr rosebraugh said had been delivered to him electronically we can no longer allow the rich to parade around in their armored existence , leaving a wasteland behind in their tire tracks steve romania , the owner of the dealership in eugene named for his father , joe , said he was bewildered both by the two attacks on his business and the steps he has had to take as a result
thursday night was one of high anxiety on television , even by the standards of a nation on red alert on cnn , cameras were focused on the old executive office building , in washington the audience , unnerved and hungry for information , awaited word were terrorists striking again \? stationed nervously near the scene , the cnn correspondent , john king , reported that the security perimeter around the white house had been extended , a helicopter was flying ominously overhead , and a robotic bombremoval device had just arrived outside the office building i wish we could tell you exactly what we have before us , but this has been a very confusing day here , he said abc news seemed to have some answers a network report raised the possibility that two other hijackings had just been narrowly averted by federal authorities two possible teams of terrorists seemed to have been attempting hijackings at la guardia and kennedy airports several people were detained , and the airports closed down some of those arrested were carrying knives , the report said later that night , hope came on the rescue effort abc , among other electronic news organizations , reported that 10 police officers were still alive underneath the rubble at the world trade center by friday morning , things had changed there were no surviving police officers it was a hoax in washington , the executive building was fine , open for business and authorities said nearly all the people held at the airports had been released and none had knives , information that undercut the likelihood that they were attempting hijackings \( abc stands by its report fully \) since tuesday , television news has received unaccustomed praise for its aggressiveness and sensitivity as the tragedy has unfolded minute by minute before the nation s eyes but the very qualities that allow television to keep its audience connected also leave it vulnerable to conveying undeveloped , sometimes erroneous reports in the fury of a fast but meandering investigation that means that the raw reporting process , normally conducted behind closed doors , unfolds before the audience tips are sometimes reported as they are received and correspondents and anchors convey information as they are developing it sometimes it pans out , and sometimes it does n't there have been reports of survivors that have turned out to be untrue on thursday , cnn , wcbstv , and the new york times on the web reported that several firefighters were rescued from the wreckage at the world trade center the report was wrong the rescue workers who emerged from the rubble had actually become trapped just 15 minutes earlier there were only two of them but the sight of their emergence was misunderstood by many who saw it those people apparently passed erroneous information along to people at the scene , to some police officers and ultimately , to reporters television producers said they were trying their best in a challenging situation but , they said , the pressure is on to feed a nation hungry for answers , and relying primarily on them to do so with security and rescue agencies having difficulty keeping their signals clear , the situation is made worse for journalists the various branches of law enforcement are operating with damaged communication systems , and at times information becomes altered as it is passed along among officials but network executives said television , like other electronic media , did not always have time to sort through it all , and did not claim to it s realtime reporting , which television does really well , said david bohrman , the senior executive producer of cnn but it is also fraught with danger because raw information is n't always accurate information that s sort of what we do , i guess evaluate and make decisions mr bohrman said the very nature of live , blanket coverage of fastmoving events can be journalistically dangerous you 're reporting a story as it s happening , which is nowhere near the neat and concise process that the newspaper is the next day , he said but the newspaper the next day is nowhere near the neat and concise job that the weekly newsmagazine is four days later and then you look at the history books , which make that seem inaccurate tom bettag , the executive producer of abc s nightline , said the audience understood that television was following a fluid situation , but in case they did not , the big network anchors make sure they do , emphasizing when information is sketchy and they are quick to correct mistakes i think there are journalistic standards that absolutely apply they do n't go out the window when you 're doing live tv , mr bettag said at the same time , it s not a 'that s the way it is' tone it s 'we 're trying to do our best to tell you an ongoing story , ' and the great anchors do it in that tone so , for instance , the abc anchor ted koppel was well within his journalistic rights thursday night to report that 10 officers were said to be alive at the world trade center a woman had told the police that her husband was among them , and had phoned her to tell her he was trapped , but in good shape nightline then interviewed an elated fireman or someone who appeared to be one heading to the rescue scene it later turned out the woman was lying , the police said
dallas , feb 9 fredaysha lucky was waving a red baton as she led the 15 children at her feet through the letters of the alphabet , each stapled to the wall behind her she would shout out a letter , followed by a word and the letter s sound 'e , ' elephant , eh ! 'i , ' igloo , ih ! and the children , crosslegged on a green rug , would follow in loud unison she and her class tripped over only two letters , not bad , considering that fredaysha is 4 years old and half the others in room 4 at the margaret h cone head start center here are 3 nearly all of them are black or hispanic and live in an adjoining housing project , which is among the poorest in dallas and is mostly barren , but for the occasional pecan tree the bush administration hopes to replicate scenes like this at thousands of head start preschool centers across the country administration officials described the cone center as a rigorous model for teaching the more than 800 , 000 poor children in the federal program about letters , syllables and spelling to prepare them to learn to read when they move to kindergarten or first grade among those in the administration championing the cone center approach is the first lady , laura bush , who visited the center in 1999 as first lady of texas young people deserve to have strong prereading and language activities in their prek programs , mrs bush said today in a statement relayed by her office in seeking to broaden the menu of head start beyond the provision of care , meals , play and limited learning , president bush is relying on researchers who argue that waiting too long to expose poor children to the basic elements of reading leaves them hopelessly behind peers blessed with far more academic resources , particularly at home that may sound unassailable but a cadre of developmental psychologists and educators , including members of the head start establishment , contends that the president s accelerated approach could be harmful they argue that teaching 3 and 4yearolds with little exposure to reading at home about too many components of language could prove devastatingly frustrating , enough to derail their educational careers before they begin we know that reading to children and talking to them at this age can be beneficial , said david elkind , a professor of child development at tufts university and the author of the hurried child , a 1981 book being reissued this spring by perseus books as soon as you get into some of the more complicated things , kids may experience failure they may feel like they 're stupid an aide to mr bush said the administration was expecting such criticism some of this is going to offend the sensibilities of the developmentally appropriate , montessoriesque advocates of 'wait till they 're ready , ' the aide said we feel we 've got to intervene at times , head start has come under attack from conservatives who accuse it of usurping the role of families but few today question the program s value for poor children the debate is over what should happen at the centers mr bush is challenging the hierarchy of priorities that has guided head start for much of its 36year history most of the nation s 16 , 000 head start centers , a loose federation governed by committees of parents and administrators but answerable to the federal government , have ranked the availability of free medical care , counseling , meals and even extended play time as high as , if not higher than , helping children prepare to read but mr bush would like to turn that pyramid on its head we do n't want to interrupt any of the social service components , the president s aide said but the most important part of head start , the president believes , is literacy development while cone is but one head start center that emphasizes literacy , a continuing government study of 40 head start programs across the country , begun in 1997 , has found that the typical head start graduate entered kindergarten knowing no more than two letters in a 1999 analysis of those early results , three researchers led by nicholas zill wrote , a probable reason why head start children are not learning early reading skills like letter recognition and print awareness is that many head start teachers are not teaching them mr bush s aide said the department of health and human services , which oversees head start , will soon begin developing a curriculum that every head start teacher will be expected to follow it will be modeled on the script that was created at the cone center in southwest dallas by researchers from southern methodist university with a grant from texas instruments the administration has also encountered anxious opposition on another front its plans to move head start to the department of education mr bush has described the move as consistent with his priorities , but advocates worry that the program s social service mission might be lost in 1978 , president jimmy carter sought a similar move , for similar reasons , but was dissuaded in large part by marian wright edelman , founder and president of the children s defense fund , a liberal lobbying group she argued then , as now , that minority parents wielded power in head start centers that they lacked in a public school system overseen by the department of education
reno , nev , oct 13 a piece of mail received by a microsoft office in reno contained anthrax , the governor of nevada said today , making this the third known location involving anthrax contamination in the united states none of the six people who touched the envelope or were nearby when it was opened on friday in an office of microsoft licensing in reno are known to be infected , the governor , kenny guinn , said at a news conference today in carson city the envelope contained a check that microsoft had sent to a vendor in malaysia , governor guinn said the check was returned to microsoft with some pornographic pictures the envelope remained unopened in the office of the worker to whom it was addressed while she was away for a week , dan leach , a microsoft spokesman , said when the employee returned , she opened the envelope and found the check and the pornography , which appeared to have been moistened and dried the company immediately called state health officials , who contacted the federal centers for disease control and prevention tests found that the pornography was contaminated with anthrax but that the check was not the governor said the material was being sent to the federal disease centers for dna testing to show whether the anthrax was a strain that could transmit the disease or was a vaccine strain that could not infect people officials said the tests could be performed quickly , but a thunderstorm delayed a plane taking the material to the agency in atlanta but governor guinn said , all of our health people in washoe county feel that this is a very , very low risk for public health under the circumstances because there was no residue of any powder in this envelope mr leach said five workers and one relative of a worker who were in the office had been tested getting the results could take until monday afternoon or tuesday , said bob harmon , a spokesman for the washoe county health department about 160 people worked in the office microsoft licensing is a microsoft subsidiary that licenses the company s software to companies around the world officials would not identify the malaysian company that the letter had been addressed to people are really looking at things much more closely and with more scrutiny than they did a month or even days ago , mr harmon said daron borst , an fbi agent in las vegas , said it was too early in the investigation to say whether the reno case was connected with the other cases of contamination eight employees of american media inc in boca raton , fla , a supermarket tabloid publisher , have had contact with anthrax , and one has died of pulmonary , or inhalation , anthrax an assistant to tom brokaw at nbc news in new york city contracted cutaneous anthrax from a letter that contained the bacteria in a granular substance mr borst would not comment on the specifics of the reno letter , what it contained or who might have sent it dr randy todd , the state epidemiologist , told the associated press that the envelope contained five pictures and that one was contaminated the first test of the envelope and its contents on friday showed the pornography was contaminated and the check was not a second test on friday night found no anthrax contamination but a third test for anthrax today was positive workers at the microsoft licensing office could not be reached for comment photo gov kenny guinn of nevada said the anthrax letter posed little risk \( associated press \)
the attack of the number crunchers has begun , but do n't worry even those of you who are intimidated by statistics which is to say , virtually all of you can survive it , using the simple system delineated here the crunch in question is the data from the 2000 census the first batch , the total head count for new jersey and the rest of the country , was released last week with great fanfare \( for the record , the numbers showed that new jersey grew 89 percent in the last decade , which in layman s terms means that if you weighed 150 pounds in 1990 , you weigh 163 pounds today \) more data will be parceled out as the year progresses about what color we are , how much money we make , what we do for a living until eventually we know almost as much about ourselves as we know about madonna s sex life the problem is , this information will be delivered primarily by bureaucrats and professors and will thus be full of technical terms like percentage and congressional reapportionment , making it as incomprehensible as it is boring that is why i spent almost an entire coffee break developing a simple method for dealing with the avalanche of figures headed our way i call it the party of 10 system \( r \) if you prefer , you can call it the idea i stole from one of those chain email letters it works like this imagine that there are 10 guests at a party and that the guests perfectly represent the demographics of new jersey so , starting with the obvious , five would be male , five female every time new census statistics come your way , your mental picture of the guests can get more detailed for instance , the next data might tell us that six of the guests are new jersey natives \( that s what the 1990 census showed \) or that all but two are white \( again , 1990 \) the chain email that inspired the party of 10 system \( r \) used a similar gimmick to describe the world s population , except with a base of 100 and a heavy dose of moralizing \( seventy of the people would be nonwhite , 30 would be white 89 would be heterosexual , 11 would be homosexual 6 would possess 59 percent of the entire world s wealth , and all 6 would be from the united states \) the intent seemed to be to make recipients pause and think , and it certainly worked mostly what i paused and thought was that i should stop reading irksome chain emails anyway , one beauty of the party of 10 system \( r \) is that it lets you make quick , clear comparisons across decades or even centuries , without having to account for inflation , leap years , etc this can dramatically underscore important social trends for instance , history books suggest that had our imaginary party convened back in 1820 , only one of the 10 guests would have been able to read had our party convened three weeks ago , however , virtually all of the guests would have been able to read , yet not a single one would have heard of donald diwhatshisname , the guy who s going to be our governor for the next year similarly , in 1990 the party of 10 would have included 3 people under the age of 21 a century ago , in contrast , 4 of the guests would have been children but , remarkably , none would have been named britney , britany or brittanie i 've taken the liberty of developing some party of 10 \( r \) projections using 1990 figures , interviews with experts and impressions i 've developed by eavesdropping on people at the supermarket the full census figures , when released , will almost surely show these things about the 10 party guests six will be in the work force four of those will drive to work alone none will feel guilty about it three will have at least some college education none will understand how this whole electricityderegulation thing works eight will be somewhat concerned or very concerned about global warming nine will think it s been too danged cold this winter one will have been born in a foreign country seven will live in the same houses they lived in five years ago nine will experience occasional wanderlust but will not act on it because going to newark airport scares them one will have been the victim of a crime in the last year eight will have turned up at that casting call last summer for bit parts in the sopranos six will attend some form of religious service at least occasionally , but all 10 will agree with this , from horace we are just statistics , born to consume resources drawing \( nancy doniger \)
a federal judge rejected former police officer charles schwarz s bid to win a new trial in the abner louima case yesterday , saying that the testimony of a former police sergeant who came forward after four years on mr schwarz s behalf was riddled with misperceptions and inaccuracies the ruling left mr schwarz with only a federal appeals court to turn to in his twoyear campaign to reverse his conviction in the infamous brutality case his lawyers , however , said they were not surprised by the decision and insisted they would go to the appellate panel with their claims that mr schwarz , despite two guilty verdicts rendered by two separate federal juries , is , in fact , innocent of the charges that he participated in the assault on mr louima , a haitian immigrant the decision by judge eugene h nickerson focused on the account of patrick walsh , a former brooklyn police investigator , who appeared in federal district court in brooklyn last month to challenge the testimony of the chief witness the government used to convict mr schwarz and send him to prison for 15 years the witness , sgt eric turetzky , has repeatedly testified that he saw mr schwarz leading mr louima toward a bathroom in the 70th precinct station house in brooklyn on the night of the assault mr walsh , however , claimed under oath that during an impromptu interview only six days after the attack , sergeant turetzky admitted that he was not sure whether mr schwarz or another officer , thomas wiese , had walked mr louima toward his eventual ordeal in a 34page opinion , judge nickerson lacerated mr walsh as a witness whose credibility was undermined not only by a serious drinking problem , but also by the other officers who interviewed sergeant turetzky on aug 15 , 1997 although mr walsh swore he was one thousand percent sure that sergeant turetzky had expressed doubt about mr schwarz s role in the assault , his version was not supported by the two other officers who took part in the interview , a point not lost on judge nickerson every other witness to turetzky s interview either does not recall turetzky speaking of this at all , the judge wrote , referring to the issue of which officer walked mr louima toward his torture , or recalls only his confusion about louima s later escort from the bathroom there was a flurry of hope in the schwarz camp when mr walsh and his intriguing story of misidentification first surfaced during a hearing before a manhattan appeals court in july it seemed that the former officer with the goatee beard and the hangdog eyes was mr schwarz s best chance yet in a long campaign for exoneration that has been played out in staten island churches and brooklyn catering halls and bars when he took the witness stand last month , mr walsh presented himself as a haunted man plagued by the louima case whose story had fallen on deaf ears throughout the police department s ranks but as the hearing on his tale progressed , witness after witness contradicted his account and mr walsh s personal life especially what he admitted was a serious drinking problem was examined under a harsh public light despite judge nickerson s detailed dismantling of mr walsh s story , mr schwarz s lawyers said that one promising bit of testimony had emerged from the hearing they pointed to statements by capt james peters , one of the officers who took part in the initial turetzky interview , who recalled the sergeant s saying that mr schwarz and mr wiese had similar hairstyles and looked somewhat alike the lawyers also said that while the hearing before judge nickerson was a procedural necessity , the true audience for their claims was the appellate court we did n't expect the judge to rule in our favor , said ronald p fischetti , mr schwarz s chief lawyer we intend to go forward vigorously in the court of appeals with our argument that this information would have made a difference in the outcome of the trial alan vinegrad , the united states attorney in brooklyn , reacted to the ruling yesterday with measured satisfaction , saying that judge nickerson s decision to reject a new trial was in line with the findings of the juries that convicted mr schwarz of assaulting mr louima and then covering up his role in the attack i am very pleased , mr vinegrad said , that the district court , having heard and scrutinized the evidence , has concluded that none of the recent allegations advanced by schwarz undermines confidence in those verdicts in any way
detroit , june 19 it would not have mattered tonight if the rookie randy keisler held runners a little better , if the bullpen prevented a lateinning rout , or if the yankees had completed their trade for ugueth urbina the knuckleball of steve sparks made those imperfections irrelevant sparks allowed three hits , all in the first three innings , and needed only 85 pitches to complete the detroit tigers' 71 victory keisler , one of three rookies currently in the yankees' rotation , allowed three runs in six innings he did not pitch poorly , but he permitted five stolen bases , a problem he will have to address the faces of some yankee players sagged as they heard that the tentative deal for urbina , a relief pitcher for the montreal expos , had collapsed they had little knowledge of urbina s medical history , the examinations of his elbow , which he failed , or his contract they know only what they saw last week , that urbina was throwing very hard too bad , one veteran player said are they going to get somebody else \? club officials are working on acquiring a reliever and an established hitter , additions which should probably not be paramount , given that the yankees are going through one of the easiest segments of their schedule they will play two more games in this series against the tigers , who are nine games under 500 , before going to tampa bay for three games but sparks s knuckleball served as an equalizer tonight sometimes knuckleballs will roll benignly in the air currents and become vulnerable , but sparks s knuckler quivered and jigged unpredictably we did n't get any tumblers tonight , manager joe torre said we got a lot of darts hitters say there is no real plan against a knuckleball , because its location and trajectory are unpredictable you can throw everything out the window , derek jeter said , because it s like playing softball there s no way to prepare for it the best hope is that the knuckleball is not working , or that the pitcher is not throwing the knuckleball for strikes and is forced to throw fastballs over the plate sparks s knuckler was working , and he was throwing strikes they 're so disciplined , said sparks , who is 52 this year and 51 in his career against the yanks what i tried to do is show them i was going to throw strikes early in the count and that got them swinging jeter singled in the first scott brosius tripled and scored on todd greene s single in the third the final 18 yankees to the plate produced two walks and no hits , and the tigers turned three double plays the yankees needed more than three hits with keisler pitching the yankees believe andy pettitte will rejoin their rotation july 1 , and orlando hern ndez in midaugust the team s pitching rotation , then , is quilted , with a couple of big pieces stitched together with three much smaller parts roger clemens has 269 victories , mike mussina 153 the other three starters ted lilly , adrian hern ndez and keisler have four career victories with such inexperience , there will be inevitable problems , and strange and ugly games the yankees have not been accustomed to seeing over the last five years , like lilly s onehit , eightwalk outing against the mets on sunday night tonight s game was more bizarre than sublime with keisler , because of the rookie s inability to hold runners keisler \( 12 \) is very slow in his delivery and his move to first base is below average the former met roger cede o singled to lead off the first , then stole second with one out and damion easley at first , cede o stole third then , on a subsequent pitch , easley swiped second three stolen bases in the first inning , and the tigers could not score but they kept on running easley stole second in the third inning , cede o bunted with two out in the fifth and stole second incredibly , all the tigers' running had nothing to do with the three runs they scored against keisler in his six innings of work dean palmer slammed his 10th homer of the season in the fourth inning , tying the game at 11 juan encarnacion slugged his eighth homer with one out in the sixth , and shane halter tripled and scored on jarrod patterson s single i thought he pitched well , torre said the tigers scored four runs against ramiro mendoza and carlos almanzar in the seventh , window dressing in a game in which steve sparks needed none inside pitch andy pettitte , on the 15day disabled list with a groin injury , played catch tuesday at the team s complex in tampa , fla the yankees asked for release waivers on outfielder henry rodriguez photo ramiro mendoza gave up four runs and four hits before manager joe torre , left , took him out in the seventh \( associated press \) \( pg d3 \)

it was , in the annals of terrorism , an exquisitely choreographed operation in the minutes before and after 8 yesterday morning , four large passenger jets lifted off at major eastern airports , headed for california it was the time of the morning when airports are usually buzzing , when vacationers get an early start on long days of travel and business people leave the east coast expecting to arrive in time for meetings in the afternoon the planes , two boeing 767 s and two 757 s , were not especially full each had two pilots and none had a more than nine flight attendants on board but all of them carried thousands of gallons of fuel , more than enough to make the crosscountry flight and once aloft , they were remarkably effective flying bombs just what happened onboard the flights may not be clear for weeks or months , if ever in brief , panicked calls from cellular telephones , at least a few passengers told of hijackers , armed with knives , subduing crew members and seizing control in one call , an official said , a flight attendant reported that two other flight attendants had been stabbed what is obvious , though , is that the attacks represented a new weapon in the terrorist arsenal , an ingenious marriage of oldschool hijacking and the evermorefamiliar suicide bomb in each case , the authorities said , it appeared that terrorists probably teams of terrorists had managed to board the flights undetected , overcome the flight attendants , penetrate cockpits that are normally kept locked , and gain control of the aircraft it was likely , experts said , that at least one attacker aboard each plane knew something about flying a jet as with the 1998 bombings of united states embassies in kenya and tanzania and a foiled plot to bomb a dozen american jetliners in east asia over a period of a few days in january 1995 , the synchronization of the attacks in new york and washington appeared to be part of their symbolism but more than any previous terrorist action in the united states , the hijackings yesterday were astounding examples of planning and coordination this was an incredibly complicated operation , said daniel benjamin , a terrorism expert who served until this year on the national security council it s hard to imagine the kind of work and preparation and coordination that went into something like this the four planes took off within minutes of each other american airlines flight 11 , a boeing 767 , left logan airport in boston for los angeles at 7 59 am united airlines flight 175 , another 767 from logan to los angeles , departed from an adjoining terminal at 8 14 am at dulles international airport in virginia , the main international gateway for washington , american flight 77 , a boeing 757 , left for los angeles at 8 21 am united flight 93 , left newark international airport for san francisco at 8 43 what the pilots and crews were able to communicate with airtraffic controllers has not been revealed one official involved in piecing together what happened said the attackers on at least one plane managed to turn off its transponder , the radio transmitter that communicates the plane s identity and altitude to ground controllers former federal lawenforcement officials familiar with airline security said that any such action should have immediately alerted airtraffic controllers that something was seriously wrong at 8 28 , as american flight 11 flew west over amsterdam , ny , it made a sharp turn and headed south on a looping path toward new york city according to information from the federal aviation administration , united flight 175 did not deviate from its flight plan until it hit northern new jersey it then turned and flew almost due south before turning again and flying north to manhattan on board one of the two american flights , an official said , a flight attendant made a desperate call to the airline s operations center , apparently using a cellular telephone two other flight attendants had been stabbed , the attendant said a hijacker had broken into the cockpit the flight attendant knew the seat number of one of the hijackers , but apparently was unable to clarify much of what was going on , including the number of attackers we can only imagine what happened , the official said on board american flight 77 , barbara olson , a conservative television commentator , called her husband from a cellular telephone and said simply , we 're being hijacked in a second brief call , mrs olson said two hijackers , armed with knives and a box cutter , had herded a pilot , flight attendants and most of the 58 passengers into the back of the plane the indication that at least some of the pilots may not have been at the controls when the planes crashed led some terrorism experts to speculate that the hijackers had some flight training but two commercial pilots who train others to fly jets said that turning a big jet into a building would require some aviation skill , but not a great deal you can just turn the yoke , said one pilot , who spoke on the condition he not be named an airplane of this size does n't require the same coordination used for a light airplane it s not as though you have to have any particular knowledge of flightcontrol systems aviation experts noted that the cockpits of the two boeing aircraft , the 757 and the 767 , are virtually the same some time in a flight simulator , or even with a computer software program , might have been training enough to accomplish the terrorists' goal , they said another question that remains unanswered is how much the authorities knew about the hijackings as they unfolded but in pennsylvania , an emergency dispatcher reported receiving a cellular telephone call from united flight 93 from a passenger locked in one of the bathrooms of the 757 we are being hijacked , we are being hijacked ! the man was quoted as saying , according to the associated press the airplane was going down , the man said , shortly before it crashed in a field about 80 miles southeast of pittsburgh while the authorities would say almost nothing about the apparent planning of the attacks , terrorism experts said it was likely that they had taken months or even years to prepare in order to overcome airport security , it is probable that the terrorists had teams of people in each of the cities where the planes took off the history of terrorism suggests that they would have conducted careful surveillance to determine the nature of the security measures at the airports , the operations of the airlines and the reliability of their schedules they had to be around airports a lot , they had to practice , and they could n't stand out in a crowd , mr benjamin said they did not just fly in for this several terrorism experts said the attacks immediately recalled ramzi ahmed yousef , the man convicted in 1996 of leading terrorist cells that plotted attacks on american targets in the united states and abroad because mr yousef had managed to organize the 1993 bombing of the world trade center with a loosely knit and poorly trained group of comrades , officials had tended to discount other plans he had for complex , coordinated attacks , and blowing up commercial jetliners the reaction of american lawenforcement officials and intelligence agencies was that this was pieinthesky , said vincent m cannistraro , a former counterterrorism official at the central intelligence agency photos at top , the south tower of the world trade center came crashing down yesterday after terrorists sent two airliners into the twin towers above , an emergency worker treated a man hurt in the attack \( chang w lee the new york times \) \( associated press \) spectators walked through debris from the world trade center \(

paris , may 28 prime minister lionel jospin jumped into the debate over the future of the european union today , categorically rejecting germany s proposals for a more centralized federal europe and instead offering a extensive blueprint for fine tuning a system that keeps most power in the hands of member states i want a europe , but i remain attached to my nation , mr jospin said in a longawaited speech delivered to the foreign press club here making europe without unmaking france , or any other european nation that is my political choice the question of just how to remake a system that everyone agrees has become too unwieldy , particularly as the 15member european union debates when and how to accept new members , has been center stage for months several german leaders have advocated that the union be remade more in the style of a united states such talk has put increasing pressure on mr jospin to respond , as germany and france are seen as the twin engine that drives europe moreover , germany s proposals are looked on with suspicion by many european leaders while german officials say their plan reflects a willingness to transfer more sovereignty to a european government , other countries fear that because of its large population , germany would end up with more influence than ever mr jospin made clear that overall , he believed that in creating a loose grouping , the european union s founding fathers essentially got it right the first time while the union needs to be strengthened , he said , the french could never accept a radical diminution of their nation s sovereignty but the prime minister , who is expected to run for president next year , has taken his time in presenting his own plan in recent weeks the british press has speculated that mr jospin was holding back as a favor to a liberal colleague , prime minister tony blair of britain , who is running for reelection among voters who are none too excited about increasing the reach of the european union in fact , mr blair quickly rejected mr jospin s notions of unified tax rates this is an argument , you know , that has gone on , said mr blair , who was in northeastern england campaigning for the june 7 election but we have won this argument every time it has been raised in europe in germany , officials of chancellor gerhard schr der s party conceded that there were sizable disagreements between mr schr der s vision and mr jospin s but some also saw large areas of common germanfrench ground , pointing to mr jospin s call for a common european border police force , a european prosecution authority and a european crime fighting force mr jospin s address befitted his reputation as man of detail , covering subjects from the need to have common laws that would , for instance , deal with divorces of binational couples to proposals for tax harmonization and a new way of choosing the president of the european commission , the union s executive commmittee he also touched on issues ranging from european farm policy and the need to support european artists to how to remake the union s decisionmaking structures originally envisioned to serve only five member countries , they are now considered to be nearing paralysis with 15 another dozen countries are expected to join the union in the next decade a summit meeting on the issue in nice last december ended with adjustments to the voting systems that some analysts have said only make things worse but the union members did agree to revisit the issue in 2004 chancellor schr der called for a radical overhaul of the union that would include creating a twochamber system of government one chamber would be the popularly elected european parliament , much invigorated from its current weak state , and the other would be made up of ministers from each country under mr jospin s plan , the basic structure of the european union would not change , and the prime minister emphasized that cooperation between governments still plays an important role and will remain indispensable mr jospin proposed that the union continue to have a commission the brusselsbased executive panel that initiates european union policy a parliament and a powerful council of ministers made up of ministers from member countries he urged that europeans look beyond an economic and monetary union to include the cultural , health , legal , security , education and environmental concerns of its citizens europe can not merely be a freetrade zone , he said mr jospin s proposals tinker all over the place he would , for instance , buttress the commission , or executive , and parliament by appointing a commission president from the winning bloc of parties in the european elections he also called for the council of ministers be able to dissolve the parliament at the request of the commission , which is not possible now at some points today , mr jospin seemed to take aim at the far less detailed ideas put forward last year by president jacques chirac , mr jospin s longtime conservative rival and likely opponent in the 2002 presidential race mr chirac also rejected german visions of a more federal kind of european union he proposed what some have termed a twotier union , in which some core nations could be more integrated than others mr jospin called such an idea unacceptable , though the issue was not fully explored in his speech , and in some places mr jospin seemed to propose a similar idea it is unclear how much of an issue either man s vision will be in the election , since both oppose the model proposed by the germans photo prime minister lionel jospin of france discussed europe s future \( associated press \)
rarely is a trial judge thrashed so publicly by an appeals court microsoft and its lawyers were undoubtedly pleased that the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit focused as intently in this week s oral argument on the behavior of judge thomas penfield jackson as on the company s own misconduct but the software giant should not get too confident the more than seven hours of testimony did little to undermine the soundness of judge jackson s central finding that microsoft violated the nation s antitrust laws the very strength of the government s case is what makes judge jackson s behavior especially lamentable in particular , the judge s illadvised public statements about the case for example , comparing microsoft to a drug gang violate judicial norms and create the unfortunate impression that he may have been biased as harry t edwards , the circuit court s chief judge , rightly said the system would be a sham if all judges went around doing this but judge jackson s indiscretions are of secondary importance to the legal issues now before seven judges of the circuit court the judges must measure the significance of his failure to afford microsoft an evidentiary hearing on the appropriate remedy in the case if that is deemed a serious flaw , it need not be fatal the remedy is to remand the case to the lower court for a hearing some on the panel also made it apparent they felt judge jackson had failed to define the market in which microsoft was unfairly seeking to compete that , too , can be cured on remand but none of these uncertainties should obscure the deeper truth of this case the trial record convincingly showed that microsoft illegally abused its windows operating system monopoly to take on competitors developing other applications , such as netscape , in the market for internet browsers it did so by tying its internet explorer to windows and by bullying computer manufacturers who sought to make it easier for consumers to opt instead for netscape s navigator microsoft s predatory behavior was also defensive in nature , as it feared netscape might develop a platform that could threaten the dominance of the windows operating system that sure looks like an illegal effort to maintain the windows monopoly true , some of the appellate judges two of whom ruled in microsoft s favor on this issue in 1998 may believe that internet browsers are integral to a computer s operating system and cannot be thought of as a separate market this argument has since gained more credence in a universe of increasingly webcentric computing devices but the broader point is that competition in developing and marketing other software appliances will be enhanced if microsoft is prevented from again abusing its windows monopoly hence the wisdom of judge jackson s structural remedy , breaking microsoft into two separate companies , one selling the operating system and the second focused on other applications the appeals court may reverse parts of the decision and is likely to remand the case to a different trial judge to further flesh out some of these issues such an action could spur new settlement talks if so , the bush administration should defend consumers' interests as vigorously in this case as did the clinton justice department
could this be the first normal echristmas \? these days normal is a relative term , of course , what with terrorist threats , mounting unemployment and clear evidence of a recession but this holiday , the internet has lost the frenzied quality it had in last few years , which featured madcap battles among startups like etoys and established companies like toys r us trying to fend them off this year , amazoncom is one of the few web brands to have truly established itself and even those that now dominate the online extensions of the biggest brickandmortar chains , like walmart , or catalog retailers , like j crew , are scaling back marketing and dropping unprofitable merchandise for everyone , this holiday the internet may look more like simply another sales channel , taking its place alongside the department store , strip mall , the chain store and mailorder catalog in the retailing arsenal and evidence has been accumulating this year that the growth of online shopping has been leveling off , with fewer novices giving it a try and the repeat clientele being more picky about what and how often it will buy that is why this holiday shopping season , despite any one consumer s costbenefit analysis of whether it is safer to venture into crowds or risk opening packages mailed to their homes , the consensus opinion seems to be that online retailing will fare only about as well or as poorly as the retail economy as a whole the online channel is not immune to what is happening in the economy , said sean baenen , a managing director of odyssey research , a marketing consultant that conducts a twice yearly telephone survey of 3 , 000 people in odyssey s most recent survey , conducted in july , 51 percent of the respondents said they were more intent on bargainhunting than in the past and while people see low prices as one of the internet s advantages , they tend to use the net much more for discretionary items , like books , computers and clothing that they can cut back on in tough times , rather than for staples like food and drugs etailing s new maturity stands in contrast to 1998 , when online shopping really took off from that point sales kept surging , seemingly little affected by general economic trends or even normal seasonal patterns in 1999 , when online sales passed 1 percent of the retail economy , and in 2000 , when the figure passed 25 percent , etailing s growth continued even during those times of the year when retail sales in other venues dropped off , like the months after christmas and during the summer now , though , while online shopping is still growing faster than the economy as a whole , its traffic and sales volumes more closely track other patterns of consumer spending amazoncom , the largest online store , now predicts its fourthquarter sales will be up by no more than 10 percent compared with last year s period but in the end might do no better than match last year s fourthquarter sales of 972 million jupiter media metrix , an internet research firm , has backed off its earlier forecast of a 20 percent increase holiday online spending , now predicting only an 11 percent gain compared with the 2000 holiday season that is still a little bit better than the economy over all after the sept 11 attacks , the national retail federation cut its prediction of fourthquarter retail sales growth to 22 percent from 4 percent online shopping appears to have bounced back in october after falling after the attacks , much as other retail sales have one study commissioned by yahoo found that some consumers appeared more interested in online shopping after the attacks in a telephone survey of 1 , 000 people in august , 54 percent of wired respondents said they planned to shop online this holiday season by october that number increased to 60 percent when analysts at a c nielsen looked more closely at that trend , they noticed that nearly all the increased interest in online shopping came from people in the northeast our hypothesis is that the tragedy attracted traffic to the online news sites and that has increased comfort with the internet , said manjima khandelwal , director of client services with nielsen yahoo s survey was completed before anthrax was found in scattered post offices and mailrooms and so did not address the question of whether consumers would shy away from ordering gifts that would arrive by mail but executives from online stores say they have not seen any drop in orders in the wake of the anthrax news if anything , people are going to be looking for a return address on a package they know and trust , said jean jackson , chief executive of walmartcom we think they will be comfortable when they see walmart moreover , ms jackson said she was hopeful that if people traveled less over the holidays than in years past , they would use online shopping as a convenient way to have gifts wrapped and shipped to outoftown friends and relatives even those who do travel may still turn to the internet , she predicted in the past you could pack 14 bags of gifts into the overhead compartments , she said this year that s not going to happen and you may want to ship your gifts ahead
how would howard cosell , who died in 1995 , have rated the performances of the actors who are playing him in ali , which opens in theaters today , and monday night mayhem , which will be seen jan 14 on tnt \?

columbia , mo , sept 23 the economy is sinking in this , the biggest city in central missouri since the terrorist attacks on new york and the pentagon , mary and bill hires s notions of buying anything nonessential have evaporated ms hires , 69 , whose husband was a professor at the university of missouri here before he retired , was putting a bag into her van in the walmart parking lot near columbia s new southwestern subdivisions we felt very secure , she said we were at the point of getting into the 21st century they planned to replace their old television set and install a satellite dish antenna we were going to spend a little more money on personal pleasures , ms hires said we do n't have that feeling now the antenna costs 50 a month we do n't need that priorities here are shifting with the economy we have been thinking of getting a new car next summer , said anita bruzzese , 42 , a writer and mother of two boys , 6 and 12 we still have that on the agenda but i promise you it wo n't be a gas guzzler shuttling children to school , she said , it s one mom in each car we 're talking about carpooling for decades , the economy of columbia has been unusually resilient driven by its colleges and universities , its hospitals and insurance companies , it tends to resist the worst of the booms and busts that plague layoffprone manufacturing towns for years , it has had one of the lowest unemployment rates in the nation , rarely exceeding 2 percent but last week , even columbia started showing signs of tumbling into a recession people are buying what they need , they say , but little of what they once wanted they are shredding their prosperitynurtured plans for bigger homes , bigger cars , new appliances and a higher standard of living they have stopped applying for credit cards as columbia goes , so , almost certainly , most of the nation is going to declare a recession , the government requires six months' evidence of reduced consumer and business spending , and that has yet to show up but within the banking system , evidence is building that consumers are acting on their postattack sentiments and scripting a recession thirty miles south of columbia , in the state capital , jefferson city , is the midwest independent bank it is what is known as a bankers' bank , or a correspondent bank it has no tellers or atm s its purpose is to provide financial services to more than 300 mostly small banks in missouri , nebraska and iowa by watching the loans and transfers the banks make to one another each day , midwest independent can spot signs of a surging or chilling economy almost instantly it can tell when the customers of other banks start to retreat from stores , fall behind on credit card payments or stop applying for loans nearly two weeks after the terrorist attacks , camden r fine , the bank s president , sees an already slowing economy slowing even more he said one compelling sign was that affiliated banks were transferring less money through his bank last week transfers dropped to an average of 265 a day from a rate of 300 in the weeks before sept 11 everything has changed , said mr fine , who also owns a small bank in ashland , between columbia and jefferson city prior to the attacks , housing was strong , tourism was slowing , but it was n't in the dumps now you have loan demand slowing people are more cautious about withdrawing money , and they 're adding to their deposits consumers appear to be shunning anything frivolous near columbia , at the kingdom city exit off interstate 70 , sales at the barnlike ozarkland souvenir store have stalled people are sad , said sharon brown , assistant manager they ask for only one item , american flags , and the store ran out of them within hours of the attacks , ms brown said in columbia , at starrett fine jewelers on broadway , michael oetting , the manager , said standard bridal and anniversary jewelry , they 're back to normal spontaneous purchases , they 're not at summit travel on broadway , jerry price , president , has cut his five agents' hours by 20 percent the phones have been very quiet , he said it causes us to be wary about our future mr price s travails echo across the economy , in his agents' diminished incomes and in spending for supplies and services that he has curbed for a smallbusiness person , he said , this is a crisis home sales , too , have plunged the people that did n't have to move , they 've just gone away , said sarah mackey , a broker at gaslightgundaker gmac real estate i had several buyers who were just in the starting phase , ms mackey said they had talked to their banks about mortgages and were beginning to look for bigger and better homes they just went away , she said it s the middle class that s getting squished the most , she said she said some of the more expensive houses , those priced at more than 200 , 000 , are selling because wealthier buyers have cash , and homes for less than 90 , 000 are selling because lowincome buyers can get governmentsubsidized mortgages phil gravitt , 39 , was stuffing cash into his wallet as he left a branch of boone county national bank he is in the construction business , specializing in building the concrete foundations for the forests of subdivisions that have grown up around columbia like many people here , he says he believes that burrowing in is what the terrorists want i'm not going to stop going on living and enjoying life , or the terrorists have won , mr gravitt said but like many people , too , he is making compromises i take hunting and fishing trips to colorado and south dakota , he said but i'm going to stay around home and stick with the family with fewer consumers taking money out of banks for loans and spending , mr fine at the midwest independent bank says an immense sea of money is sloshing around in bank coffers part of the reason is that at the same time consumers and businesses have been borrowing less and saving more , the federal reserve in washington has been pouring money into the economy to thwart fearful consumers' runs on banks and assure that when they do want to borrow , they can get the money by wednesday last week , mib banks that normally borrow from one another to keep their accounts balanced stopped lending and borrowing altogether they all had plenty to lend , and none needed to borrow as a result , they chopped the interest rate they charge one another from 3 percent to zero they 're sitting with excess funds , and they ca n't find anybody to buy them , mr fine said i 've never seen zero that s unprecedented by week s end , the rate was still below 1 percent once it becomes clear that the rockbottom rates are here to stay , the same banks can be expected to cut rates throughout the economy , reducing them on credit cards , car loans and home mortgages precedent shows that low rates can eventually reignite the economy in columbia last week , the standard fixedrate , 30year home mortgage was stuck at a little above 7 percent but on friday , general motors dealers began offering fiveyear car loans for no interest at all to reliable buyers ford followed suit such deals might revive consumers i have a friend in bolivar , mo , who has a gm dealership , said doug collins , 48 , a cable splicer for verizon who drives a 1996 chevrolet truck i'm going to see if what i heard is true , he said i might buy a new truck photos i had several buyers who were just in the starting phase , said sarah mackey , a real estate broker in columbia , mo after the attacks , she said , they just went away camden r fine , below left , a columbia banker , said , people are more cautious about withdrawing money \( photographs by l g patterson for the new york times \)
waltham , mass we are at a critical moment not only for afghanistan , but for the united states the northern alliance has proved itself a good proxy force , working in conjunction with american air power to drive the taliban and al qaeda forces into disarray but in a country whose recent history is one of warring factions and hostile ethnic divisions , america cannot allow northern alliance occupation of afghan cities to become the order of the day before the alliance can become entrenched , we must send in our own soldiers in large numbers to enforce human rights and keep the peace we may well need american troops as fighters to secure victory in the southern regions , too the taliban still have troops in their southern stronghold , around kandahar in these heavily pashtun areas , the northern troops are unlikely to be welcomed as liberators but beyond a military victory over al qaeda and the taliban , the great opportunity for the united states now is to lead the rebuilding of afghanistan in a way that convinces openminded people in the islamic countries that america is a force for good in the world yes , this is nationbuilding state failure is the cause of afghanistan s current woes , and by extension , many of the problems of the surrounding region we must be active in afghanistan until it is a functional nation once again one with a just sharing of power among its competing ethnic groups americans who still fear committing our troops need to know that this is not the afghanistan of the past in the 1980 s the afghan mujahedeen tormented their soviet occupiers until the soviets were finally forced out but the mujahedeen had sanctuary in pakistan , united states backing and the neartotal support of the afghan people none of this applies to the taliban after the taliban are driven from all the afghan cities , their most dedicated elements might try to fight from mountain strongholds as guerrilla warriors but without wide local support and help from the outside , they will be able to make only limited forays there is a commanding humanitarian reason , too , for the quick entry of a large american force into afghanistan our troops can provide a transitional military government over the winter months , one that can maintain law and order , collect heavy weapons from local militias , and facilitate the distribution of food , emergency supplies and reconstruction aid united nations troops and forces from many nations can help with the work of stabilizing and rebuilding but only the united states has the ability to keep afghanistan stable as it recovers from taliban rule and then to stay the course through what should be a long reconstruction phase only the united states has the overwhelming national interest to pursue what is best for afghanistan all of afghanistan s neighbors , but especially pakistan , have their own , shortsighted political agendas in afghanistan for america , the goal must be to destroy the conditions that allowed afghanistan to play host to terrorism and a defeat of terrorism in afghanistan would rob the world s terrorist movements of much of their momentum the work of military engineers and civilian construction companies will be just as important as the combat campaign scenes of afghan parents mourning their dead children , killed by stray american bombs , should be replaced by scenes of american soldiers feeding and clothing afghan children and rebuilding their homes drawing \( george bates \)
standing before a nascent business coalition in a private dining room at the regency hotel last month , mayor rudolph w giuliani held aloft tommy trout , a beautifully mounted 13inch animated fish he had outlined the economic benefits of rezoning the far west side of manhattan for commercial development , expanding the city s convention center , relocating madison square garden and building a retractabledomed stadium that could be home to the jets , the olympics and the final four college basketball tournament as the mayor pushed a button , tommy trout danced on his board and began singing joy to the world the mayor s point was not to showcase the song by three dog night he was declaring that while spawning fish in the hudson river may have stopped the westway highway project in the 1980 s , they would not get in the way of creating what he called the sports capital of the nation but , besides tommy trout , there were two striking things about that breakfast the first was the unmistakable absence of anyone from gov george e pataki s office , raising serious questions about the viability of the mayor s plan the second was that even the people who were invited to speak in support of the plan did not seem to be singing from the mayor s stadium song book many of them do seem to hope that the public discussion will enable at least some of the other things to get done since the governor controls the jacob k javits convention center and the rail yards where the billiondollar domed stadium would be built , the state is an essential player presumably , mr pataki would also be the one to establish the kind of public authority that might be necessary to transform the lowslung neighborhood , south of 42nd street and west of ninth avenue there were none of the key guys from the state , said betsy gotbaum , the former president of the newyork historical society and a candidate for public advocate , who was among the four dozen hoteliers , developers and cultural leaders at the breakfast , which was sponsored by the hudson yards coalition they have to be a partner in this , so it was a little bit confusing state officials say they are often left scratching their heads , since they would have to be financial partners in virtually every one of the projects discussed at the breakfast but are rarely party to the discussions the officials added that they had little enthusiasm for a battle with the local community over an expensive west side stadium we 're always interested in what s going on if people want to inform us , said charles a gargano , chairman of the state s economic development agency i 'd imagine if they want to develop state property , they 'll contact us sure , there have been discussions , but there are no definitive plans the mayor and the governor have long been at odds over the development of the west side while mr pataki has advocated an expansion of the javits center , mr giuliani has refused to go along unless the plans include a sports stadium the breakfast , which was described to a reporter by three people who were there , was only the latest drumbeat for billions of dollars in projects proposed for the workingclass and industrial neighborhood now regarded by developers and city officials as manhattan s last frontier tomorrow , the mayor is holding a reception at gracie mansion for corporate supporters of the effort to bring the olympics to new york city in 2012 and build an olympic stadium over the rail yards in any event , the mayor s vision for the west side did get a warm reception at the breakfast , which was put together by the cochairmen of the coalition jonathan tisch , chief executive of loews hotels , and lewis rudin , the developer , as well as peter ward , who heads the hotel trades council but that did not mean that everyone embraced a stadium instead , the speeches illustrated the difficulty in cobbling together a coalition when disparate interests like elements of a plan , but not necessarily the whole package in his introductory remarks , mr tisch said the cornerstone of the coalition s effort was the expansion of the javits center , which would help attract larger conventions , raise hotel occupancy rates and bolster the city s economy mr tisch was followed by daniel l doctoroff , president of nyc 2012 , the group leading new york s bid for the olympics he said the effort was not about travel and tourism , but the future of the city he said an olympic stadium over the rail yards , combined with a larger javits center and an expansion of the subway lines , would provide a lasting legacy and spur the development of office towers , housing and restaurants then it was mayor giuliani s turn he talked about how a stadium and an expanded convention center would bring jobs and prosperity to the city but in the end , he said the effort was all about sports , and making the west side the city s sports capital , much as lincoln center is the cultural center mr rudin , a developer active in civic affairs , and bernard mendik , chairman of the real estate board , have endorsed the olympic bid and the other projects but many developers are focused less on stadiums and more on the proposed rezoning of the far west side , which would allow for large office towers and condominiums there is a need to develop that area , said douglas durst , whose family owns many skyscrapers in midtown throwing in a stadium makes it that much more difficult and jerry i speyer , an owner of rockefeller center and the chrysler building and a part owner of the yankees , was highly critical of plans to build a stadium at the coalition s first meeting on dec 11 two people who were at that december meeting said mr speyer chastised the participants , saying that few of them cared about a stadium other than how it would help them expand the convention center they said mr speyer then recounted how he had told the yankees to give up on the west side site because it would take 10 or 15 years to get done , because of community opposition , potential lawsuits and environmental regulations two top advisers to the governor shared the developers' skepticism , though they said that mr pataki would not publicly oppose a stadium they 're tilting at windmills , said one adviser sandy lindenbaum , a dean of new york s real estate lawyers who attended the breakfast , said he had been helping to develop the zoning and financing package for the olympic bid but , he added , it s designed to work with or without a stadium and the javits expansion photo a rendering of the proposed olympic square on manhattan s west side , including , at right , a domed stadium that not everyone supports \( thomas w schaller nyc 2012 \)

sometime this morning , lou piniella will address his seattle mariners a few hours later they will play game 3 of the american league championship series against the yankees at the stadium to the naked eye , things look bleak seattle trails the threetime defending champions , two games to none , and while seattle pitching has muffled yankee bats , yankee pitching has been suffocating the fiery piniella said this morning s address will not be fire and brimstone he did that thursday night when , after a 32 loss , piniella vowed the series would return to seattle i'm going to tell you all right here , we will be back here for game 6 , he said just print it , piniella told reporters loudly i 've got confidence in my club , he added we 've gone to new york and beat this team five out of six times we 're going to do it again during yesterday s midday news conference , piniella told reporters that he had spoken out of frustration thursday night this morning s meeting will be more philosophical , more contemplative the 58yearold piniella will talk about the importance of this series to the players' careers , the city of seattle and to the franchise mostly , piniella will tell his players not to be psyched out by playing a huge game at a soldout yankee stadium some teams rely on their fans for an edge the yankees use ghosts when the seattle team bus pulls up , anyone who looks up at the stadium wall will see the world championship years placed in rows like an iconography of american history the 20 s , the 30 s , the 40 s , the 50 s the 60 s , the 70 s , the 90 s and now the 2000 s piniella will tell his team not to worry about generations of yankee success , just focus on one day october 20 , 2001 i do n't think we are intimidated , he said our guys have confidence , we 've played hard all year , we 've had a fantastic season and i'm proud of what we 've done but , you know , we 've been here two years now it s time to break that barn door down and take this thing to the next level an ocean of history and tradition separates these franchises the mariners were an expansion team in 1977 , bringing major league baseball back to seattle for the first time in eight seasons the yankees began as the baltimore orioles in 1901 , moved to northern manhattan in 1903 , purchased babe ruth from boston in the winter of 1919 and finally won a pennant in 1921 piniella played 11 seasons for the yankees , from 1974 to 1984 he played in the 1976 world series , which the yankees lost the 1977 series , which they won the 1978 series , when they won and the 1981 series , which they lost the first championship is the hardest , piniella said you do n't have that history and that tradition that this organization has it s expected that you can do it again it s confidence that you can do it , you 've done it before and you can draw from the experiences that you had that gives this organization an advantage on the other hand , there comes a time when the champion loses , when the dynasty falls , the empire crumbles celtics yankees packers rome there comes a time when someone snatches the championship away how to accomplish that will be the subject of piniella s talk this morning and the mariners' mission this weekend if you go out and you play hard and you 're not intimidated by the mystique or by the success that they 've had , and go out and play your game , they can be beaten , piniella said that s really going to be my message to my baseball team seattle won an alrecord 116 regularseason games now it has fallen through alice s looking glass and its world is topsyturvy it must win four of the next five games to reach its first world series will all be lost if the mariners lose this series \? intellectually , the answer is no if we do n't get by this level , if we do n't win a world series , piniella said , it s not going to diminish what we 've done we had a fantastic season it s only been done one time in the real world , the answer is yes invariably and probably unjustifiably , we 're going to be judged by how we do in postseason , piniella said right now , we 're down two nothing we got our backs against the wall a little bit we got to come out fighting and take it to this ball club and go out and win some games and get this thing back to seattle piniella added a final thought new york s experienced this a heck of a lot , he said it s time for somebody else to experience it photo lou piniella \( g paul burnett \)

engaged in european projects like the common currency , the euro mr duncan smith received 61 percent of the vote defining britain s role in europe has been the single most divisive issue for the tories in the past decade , and the most urgent task facing mr duncan smith tonight was to start uniting his fractious party priggish in appearance , mr duncan smith would not seem at the outset to be a formidable adversary for prime minister tony blair , a glamorous , telegenic leader given to inspirational messages and adept as he has proved in two successive elections at winning the political argument in modernday britain officials at 10 downing street were known to be more worried about a possible victory by mr clarke , a vastly more experienced politician with a bruising debating style and the kind of gladhanding pubcounter personality thought necessary to bring disaffected tory voters from middle britain back into the fold so worried were many tory officials about the party s declining electability that during the threemonth campaign , supporters of each man threatened to abandon the conservatives if the opposing candidate won , a potentially menacing development for a party that is already depleted of numbers , riven with internal feuding and short on new talent earlier this month , former foreign secretary douglas hurd , now a member of the house of lords , said moderate conservatives would revolt if mr duncan smith tried to impose his hardline euroskeptic views on them the results of the postal balloting of the party s 318 , 000 eligible members were announced in a lowkey ceremony at conservative central office this evening , a day later than scheduled and with none of the planned festivities , out of deference to the victims of the bombings in new york and washington the subject of europe did not come up in mr clarke s brief concession remarks or mr duncan smith s victory speech today is not a day for party politics , mr duncan smith said he devoted his comments instead to sending prayers to the american people and pledging that he and his party would stand shoulder to shoulder with prime minister tony blair in his support for the united states mr duncan smith s first act as leader was to go to the american embassy and sign a condolence book the new leader was the original long shot in a field of five to succeed william hague , who stepped down hours after the tories' election loss on june 7 it was the second consecutive crushing defeat suffered by the party that was long europe s greatest votegetting machine even though both candidates strove to marginalize their differences over europe in their stump appearances , the outcome was likely to be seen as affirmation of the deepseated conservative antipathy to britain s abandoning the pound for the euro and joining what mr duncan smith calls the european superstate during the race , mr clarke promised he would take a very low profile on europe if elected , and he asked his backers to shut up about the euro for his part , mr duncan smith denied that he was obsessed by europe far from it and protested characterizations of him as a singleissue candidate mr clarke , an outgoing and popular figure in british politics with a famously rumpled look , put himself forward as the best candidate to attract disaffected tory voters in the next election he argued that mr hague s opposition to europe may have been popular with the tory faithful but did n't prove popular with the electorate as a whole mr duncan smith , a sandhurstschooled former scots guard officer with a more disciplined and retiring manner , argued that the tories should never abandon their core principles and beliefs but needed to change the way they communicated them to the public labor holds a 167seat majority in the 659seat house of commons mr blair is eager to have britain enter monetary union but wary of proposing it until the economic arguments are more persuasive and the chances of winning a promised referendum sure mr duncan smith gained the backing of mr hague and former prime minister margaret thatcher mr clarke won the support of former prime minister john major mr duncan smith first came to prominence on entering parliament in 1992 when he helped lead the fight against mr major s ratifying the maastricht treaty , the agreement that laid the groundwork for setting up the european single currency that goes into effect in january his views on abortion , the death penalty , gays in the armed forces , lowering the age of consent for homosexuals , corporal punishment in the classroom and most recently the proposed missile defense shield put him securely on the right of the conservative party photo iain duncan smith , a long shot in a field of five candidates for the position of conservative party leader , greeting supporters with his wife \( agence francepresse \) \( pg b4 \)
the meltdown continues and despite investors' hopes , it may not end any time soon just when it seemed the outlook for the telecommunications equipment sector could become no worse , nortel networks said on friday that it would lose 192 billion in the second quarter as demand plummets for its switches and routers the shocking announcement came at the end of another dismal week for the telecommunications equipment industry last tuesday , the ratings on the bonds of lucent technologies were cut to junk status by standard poor s , a sign that lucent s survival as an independent company is far from sure on wednesday , avaya , which was spun off by lucent last year , said that its sales for the rest of the year would fall short of expectations and that it planned to cut 3 , 000 jobs six months ago , demand for the equipment that moves data over telephone lines and across the internet began a downward spiral that has not ended but with shares of lucent and nortel off nearly 90 percent from their peaks last year , and cisco systems' stock down 80 percent , investors may think that the prices already reflect the bad news a view shared by many analysts almost threequarters of the 42 analysts who cover cisco , for example , rate the company as a buy or strong buy but such optimism looks increasingly divorced from reality for two reasons the slowdown in sales and profits has been worse than even the most bearish analysts had imagined , with no sign of a rebound in sight and shares in the equipment companies reached such absurd levels last year that even after dropping fourfifths or more , they are still not cheap investors want to believe that the equipment makers can return to their glory days of 1999 and 2000 , when they reported significant increases in sales and profits , said paul sagawa , communications equipment analyst for sanford c bernstein but mr sagawa , who first sounded an alarm about the sector last fall , when his peers were mostly bullish , remains a skeptic he noted that over the last 50 years , telecommunications equipment sales have grown an average of 12 to 13 percent annually , powered by technological breakthroughs from satellites to fiber optic cable to cellular phones to the internet but over the last six years , spending on equipment greatly accelerated , growing 18 percent a year or more the boom peaked the last two years , when spending increased 25 percent or more annually , mr sagawa said those gains were unsustainable , he said , because they were fueled by onetime events like the deregulation of the european phone market , as well as a worldwide flood of cheap capital into telecommunications companies of all sizes mr sagawa predicts that over the next decade , the sector s growth rate will be no more than its historical average of 12 percent but even before equipment spending can begin growing again , he said , carriers like att must work though the investments they have already made we 're going to be down this year , we 're going to be down next year , we 're going to be up a bit in 2003 , and then we do n't hit normalized growth rates until 2004 , mr sagawa said yet investors are still paying premium prices for cisco and its peers cisco , which closed on friday at 1665 , down 109 , trades at almost 60 times its expected earnings for its next fiscal year , ending in july 2002 with 72 billion shares outstanding , it has a market valuation of 122 billion , more than boeing and goldman sachs combined and even as they are hemorrhaging cash and nursing stock prices in the single digits , lucent and nortel have so many shares outstanding that they also have market valuations in the 11 figures even after friday s selloff , when nortel s shares dropped 7 percent , its market value is above 30 billion lucent s is still over 20 billion the market has had the worst correction it s had in a generation , and yet it s still not cheap , said kevin parke , chief investment officer of mfs investment management , which manages 120 billion in stocks in the quarter ended march 31 , mfs sold 19 million shares of cisco , more than onefifth of its position we do n't think the pain s over even when the technology sector does rally , some investors may be disappointed , mr parke said , because it will probably rise much more slowly than it did in the late 1990 s he added that his company , whose flagship mfs emerging growth fund is down 40 percent the last year , has learned a hard lesson about leaning too heavily on technology stocks for growth if there s one thing the market taught us over the last year , it s that you do n't just want to pick one hot area , he said nikos theodosopoulos , an analyst at ubs warburg who downgraded his ratings on the sector this year , said the stocks of lucent and nortel had fallen so far that analysts now believed it was too late to cut their ratings and fear missing a rally but that theory , he said , was not supported by the facts we do n't see the sector improving until secondhalf next year , he said the telecom industry is being rationalized it s hard for the equipment companies to show good results mr sagawa said investors needed to accept the reality that equipment companies , and technology companies generally , experience cyclical peaks and valleys and that the last two years were a peak that would probably never be repeated valuing these companies means figuring out what their earnings and cash flow will be over the course of a multiyear business cycle and in that regard , he said , investors are still being overly aggressive but predicting earnings even six months out , much less six years , is impossible for many technology companies , said neil barsky , comanager of the 500 million mrg nucleus hedge fund mr barsky noted that he had recently received a 360page report from a big investment bank that featured earnings models for more than 300 companies but almost none of the models had predictions for more than one year how can you value this stuff , if you do n't have the conviction of what it s going to earn a year from now \? he said charles l hill , research director of thomson financial first call , said analysts across the technology sector appeared to be overconfident that earnings would rebound next year analysts are predicting that profits at technology companies will fall more than 40 percent this year , but rise more than 50 percent next year but earnings are unlikely to recover that fast , especially when there is no sign that they have stopped falling , mr hill said is there still room for a market correction in tech \? he said you bet chart treacherous ground the share prices of cisco , nortel and lucent have all plunged since last year but with their sales skidding , the stocks may have even further to fall , pessimistic analysts say charts show cisco systems , nortel networks and lucent technologies stock progress since jan 2000 \( source bloomberg

philadelphia , june 2 theirs has been arguably the finest season in the national basketball association on opening night , they put the league on notice by flattening the knicks at the allstar game , their coach and top player led the east to a startling upset at the trade deadline , they snagged dikembe mutombo they have the nba s most valuable player \( allen iverson \) , its coach of the year \( larry brown \) , its defensive player of the year \( mutombo \) and its top sixth man \( aaron mckie \) even in the playoffs , it is the philadelphia 76ers who have provided most of the thrills the los angeles lakers have been more dominant , but the sixers have supplied the most compelling drama from their firstround shootout featuring iverson and indiana s reggie miller , to their secondround escape against the toronto raptors , to this trashtalking , smashmouth conference title fight with the milwaukee bucks , the sixers have been mustsee tv but none of it will matter if philadelphia does not win on sunday their glut of individual hardware and their recent postseason triumphs will not stop the pain or the tears if the sixers lose the seventh game against the bucks philadelphia s ultimate goal , of course , is to win the nba championship but there will be no shame if they lose to the indomitable lakers just getting to the finals and fighting hard would cap the sixers' season nicely , a finish that few predicted for them in october but failing to win the east , after having the conference s best record , would bring no such consolation many would view their season as a failure the bottom line for us is to just win , mckie said all that mvp , defensive man , coach of the year , sixth man none of that stuff means anything to us right now we just want to go out and prove to the world that we belong this is the biggest game in all of our lives it s the biggest game in coach brown s life it s a mustwin situation and it 'll be big not just for the organization but for the city because they 're starving for a championship a victory would put the sixers in the finals for the first time since julius erving and moses malone led them to the championship in 1983 it would send brown to the finals for the first time in his illustrious 18year nba coaching career in what has become his custom , mutombo guaranteed a happy ending , just as he has throughout the playoffs we 're going to win the series , he said after the sixers were defeated , 110100 , in game 6 on friday as mad as i am , we 're going to win the series we will push them out of the building despite losing game 6 , the sixers have more than a dose of momentum heading into sunday s game after being pummeled for three quarters , they scored 46 points in the final period to nearly pull off a miraculous upset in addition , milwaukee s scott williams , who had been starting at forward , was suspended today for committing a vicious foul in the first quarter friday the best part about the sixers' late rally was that iverson finally found his stroke after averaging just 23 points on 275 percent shooting in his first four games , iverson scored 46 points , 26 of them in the fourth quarter , to put a scare into the bucks it was the first time this series that iverson resembled the player who terrorized indiana and toronto in the early rounds he is looking for a carryover on sunday my confidence never left , but it s up a little bit more now , iverson said i feel better about my shot than i was feeling i had been struggling all series the bucks tried to intimidate iverson early , with williams leveling him with an elbow three minutes into the game but while iverson got up grabbing his right shoulder , he laughed off the hit , which was ruled a flagrant foul and led to williams s suspension after game 6 and again today , iverson insulted the 6foot10 williams , alluding to his reputation as being a soft player i watched it on tape today , iverson said i did n't know it was that obvious that he was trying to take me out but it did n't bother me i jumped right back up because i mean , it s scott williams i would feel real bad if scott williams hurt me i would feel real bad about that as glad as they are to see iverson hitting shots , the sixers know that their ability to control the tempo is more important than iverson s hot hand they have won with iverson shooting poorly , but they have not won when allowing the bucks to dictate an uptempo game after getting into a shootout with the bucks in the first half of game 5 , the sixers found themselves down by 16 points before rallying to win a similar situation became worse in game 6 , when milwaukee took a 30point lead in the first half it is really quite simple if the sixers join the bucks in shooting quickly and without discrimination , milwaukee is likely to run them off the floor if the sixers slow the pace , run their offense through mutombo , work the shot clock and make the game a grind , they will probably be in control we tried to play their style of play and the end result was a loss , mckie said of game 6 we have to make those guys play our style of play we have to set the tone early , keep the game in the low 80 s , make it our kind of game an ugly , scrappy game iverson has said it best throughout the playoffs the way we play might be ugly , but the end result is beautiful so far , it has been just that rebounds with the sixers trailing by 29 points at halftime , eric snow rested his broken right ankle during the second half of game 6 he said he would play sunday if i can walk , i'm going to definitely try , said snow , who keeps his leg in a walking boot when not playing
washington , sept 13 hoping to prevent future terrorist attacks , house and senate lawmakers expressed broad support today for funneling more money to intelligence operations , beefing up spy networks and creating one agency to handle terrorism the nation spends an estimated 10 billion a year to fight terrorism , a sum that many lawmakers from both parties called inadequate and that is likely to be increased this session but instead of using the money to upgrade traditional satellite capabilities and telephone surveillance , many urged that the money be spent on oldfashioned human spying and more advanced computer tracking , the kind of intelligence that may have been able to prevent tuesday s attacks we need to reemphasize the importance of getting a human being who can get inside those cells and learn what their intentions and capabilities are , said senator bob graham , democrat of florida , the chairman of the senate intelligence committee we have also seen a reduction in the ability to eavesdrop on terrorists and others who might threaten the united states as the technology has changed it was easier when they were communicating by telephone it is more difficult when they are using computer communication mr graham and other lawmakers , speaking at news conferences and in interviews , said that just as important was the need to consolidate power to combat terrorism in one central agency or individual , a step that could alleviate dozens of existing jurisdictional battles we need to have within our intelligence agency somebody specifically in charge of our counterterrorism efforts , mr graham added today that responsibility is spread among a number of agencies and we spend too much time trying to decide just who is in charge representative porter j goss , republican of florida , chairman of the house permanent select committee on intelligence , said tuesday s terrorist attacks required a longterm commitment the world is different , he said technology is different the nature of the threat is different the response must be different the lawmakers' statements followed an acknowledgment by officials at the government s intelligence agencies the cia , the fbi and the national security agency that they were surprised by tuesday s attacks while the agencies have been criticized for what some have called an egregious lapse , many lawmakers believe that the agencies have been hamstrung by increasing restraints the issue over how to beef up intelligence is likely to begin in earnest over the next few weeks , when congress votes on a bill to finance the justice department and grapples with military spending the ideas for revamping the intelligence agencies are wideranging some lawmakers , like senator evan bayh , an indiana democrat who is on the intelligence panel , suggested that the cia should be given freer rein to stop terrorism , including reinstating its power to assassinate it s not possible to seize him and bring him to trial , mr bayh said , referring to osama bin laden if he turns out to be culpable you can argue that a more targeted approach may be in order others talked of expanding domestic eavesdropping , an idea that makes those concerned about civil liberties uncomfortable late tonight , the senate approved an amendment as part of a spending bill to finance the justice department that would make it easier for law enforcement to wiretap computers and combat cyberterrorism supporters of the bipartisan amendment said law enforcement officials must go from jurisdiction to jurisdiction to obtain a court order since computer communication crosses state boundaries the amendment would streamline the process by allowing a federal judge to issue an order after the vote , the senate passed the larger bill to finance the departments of commerce , state , justice and the judiciary you cannot tap the lines of a terrorist , said senator orrin g hatch of utah , the senior republican on the judiciary committee this corrects that the amendment caused concern among some senators who felt it was being rushed to the floor with little concern about giving the government new power to pry into someone s computer congress is also expected to act to enhance airport security for years , the house and the senate have been reluctant to increase spending on better baggage inspections and xray machines , among other things , despite the advice of the general accounting office , the investigative arm of congress now some lawmakers are urging the government to handle some portions of airport security , rather than permitting airports to hire private contractors senator ernest f hollings , democrat of south carolina , the chairman of the commerce committee , said the federal government should operate airport security scanners unless that is federalized , he said , the government cannot expect to improve its current results one intelligence analyst who works for the government but asked to remain anonymous said none of these suggestions were new the government has been aware of its intelligence gaps , he said many became obvious during the bombing of two united states embassies in africa and of the uss cole in yemen people know what the solution is , the expert said we have n't had leadership from either inside or outside to do it it s a bureaucracy that wo n't get out of its own way
monaco , may 26 since the first decades of the 20th century , the narrow , twisting harborside streets that are host to the monaco grand prix and the blindingly fast sweeps of the indianapolis 500 have defined motor racing on opposite sides of the atlantic and mirrored , in their highoctane , earsplitting way , something of the broader differences that characterize the sporting cultures in europe and america but if it has been so ever since the first running of the indy 500 in 1911 and the inaugural monaco race in 1929 , there has rarely been a time when the contrasts have been more marked when the races start on sunday , a few hours apart , the technology employed in the cars , the nature of the contests , and even the drivers' racing styles at the two events will be as different as are the yachts , casinos and 2 , 500anight hotel suites of monaco from the more prosaic environs of speedway , ind this year , the contrasts are a talking point in monaco , formula one s showcase event , in part because of the presence here of juan pablo montoya , the 25yearold colombian who won last year s indianapolis 500 in his first attempt , and who now starts among the favorites at monaco , again as a rookie montoya , whose hardcharging ways electrified spectators and television audiences in two years of indycar racing , is having a similar impact in formula one , which he joined at the end of last year for an annual salary said to be about 8 million even before he has won a formula one race , european enthusiasts are comparing the prodigious talent of montoya a bogot architect s son with the build , lightningfast reflexes and aggression of a featherweight boxer to juan manuel fangio , the argentinian who won five world drivers' championships in the 1950 s but beyond that , rave reviews for montoya s grand prix performances have given impetus to a wider debate about the high technology direction of formula one that is carrying the sport ever further away from the less complex technology , but more open racing , of indy cars as the formula one teams geared up for the race here this week , talk in the teams' gleaming motor homes beside the harbor was of the lessons indycar racing might have for formula one these would include rules changes to restrict the multimilliondollar technology that critics like niki lauda , a threetime formula one champion from austria , say is turning formula one cars into computerdriven rocket ships leaving their drivers little to do but steer and brake the calls for change are mostly from veterans of indy racing like bobby rahal , an indy 500 winner who now runs jaguar s struggling formula one team much of the formula one establishment remains steadfastly opposed , including the ferrari and mclarenmercedes squads that dominate the sport , and the williamsbmw unit , montoya s team , which is snapping at the frontrunners' heels formula one s commercial success has made it harder for people like lauda and rahal , along with emerson fittipaldi , a brazilian who won the indy 500 twice and was a double world champion in formula one , to push their heresy the idea that formula one has fallen into a trap by embracing cuttingedge technologies banned in indy racing , only to find that the resulting spectacle is often less appealing than the less high tech , but often more closely contested , indycar races several top drivers , including michael schumacher , the ferrari driver , and montoya , have said they would prefer more emphasis on driver skills but the protests have been low key schumacher , a 32yearold german who dominates grand prix racing , is said to earn upward of 100 million a year but until montoya came on the scene , many races were highspeed processions , with a handful of lead changes rahal , 48 , is part of the indy racing establishment , as winner of the 1986 indy 500 and last year as interim director of the cart singleseater racing series , formula one s closest equivalent in the united states in the jaguar job , he has found himself an outsider , arguing for technology restrictions that other formula one teams dismiss out of hand there has always been an elitism in formula one , he said in an interview in the jaguar motor home it s a very closed society in america , there s been a much greater recognition of the sporting side of motor racing , whereas here it s much more of a technological exercise in america , we 've tried to put the spectators first in europe , the attitude seems to be , 'if you do n't like it , it s your problem we are n't going to change' rahal said recent rules changes will mean that formula one cars next year will have fully automatic transmissions shifting gears at points on the track preset into onboard computers starting earlier this year , teams were allowed to use computerdriven traction control systems that eliminate wheel spin , and launch control systems that reduce starts to a push of a button on the steering wheel in the cart series , even the semiautomatic gearboxes currently in use in formula one , requiring the driver to initiate gearchange sequences by squeezing a paddle on the steering wheel , are outlawed more than anything else , though , it is montoya , the colombian newcomer , who is helping to sweep aside formula one s assumptions of superiority over indy racing for the first time in years , there is a driver who is widely regarded as a potential superstar in the schumacher mold after winning the world drivers' championship last year for the third time , schumacher is only four races short of the highest number of grand prix 51 ever won by a driver in monaco , schumacher will again start as favorite , willed on around the 19mile , 95mileanhour circuit by a sea of supporters with red ferrari flags but he faces a new kind of challenge from montoya , and he does not like it so far this year , schumacher has won three races , and montoya none but montoya has thrown down a gauntlet in brazil last month , he overtook schumacher going into a diving bend with a maneuver that had formula one veterans reaching for superlatives the maneuver came to nothing when a tailend driver speared montoya s car from the rear in austria two weeks ago , the colombian again raced wheeltowheel with the german until the two cars collided when the german protested montoya s racing tactics , the colombian struck back does he think he has a divine grace not to be overtaken \? montoya said , when told of schumacher s complaints schumacher wo n't intimidate me because i'm not as

new chinese cottages q why are so many chinese restaurants around town called cottage \? a actually there are n't that many , but until a few years ago there were none chinese restaurants , particularly those outside chinatown , have traditionally used a handful of chinese words in their names to evoke ease , domestic comfort and tranquillity , like house , garden and palace , according to jill a birnbaum , a development associate at the museum of chinese in the americas in the 1970 s and early 1980 s , as a profusion of sichuan , hunan and mandarin restaurants opened in manhattan , a kind of name shortage developed , and the english word cottage was an ad hoc addition to the repertoire ms birnbaum , who is fluent in chinese , spoke to james wang , the current owner of hunan cottage on west 76th street mr wang told her that in the early 1980 s , the original owner of his restaurant named it hunan garden in chinese , but , dismayed at the number of similarly named restaurants in the area , chose hunan cottage as the english translation hunan cottage did a brisk business , according to mr wang , and the same owner later opened a number of other restaurants in the area , all named garden in chinese but called cottage in english over time , the name was adopted by other new restaurants , and it is now commonplace beyond chinatown , where more traditionalsounding names continue to hold sway special deliverers q on the far right side of the eighth avenue facade of the main post office building , up near the parapet , the name of cardinal de richelieu is carved into the stone , along with other names and dates why \? a the chief designer of the james a farley post office , william mitchell kendall of mckim , mead white , inscribed the names of pivotal figures in western postal history at the corners of each of the three principal facades taken together , the names provide a terse tutorial in mail delivery through the ages , ranging from emperors , kings , and cardinals to otherwise obscure bureaucrats the first , starting at the western corner of the 31st street facade , is that of the persian emperor cyrus , who established a system of mounted relay messengers in egypt in the sixth century bc , followed by the roman emperor augustus , who developed a series of post roads with relay stations between rome and its provinces these names are followed by nerva , the emperor who canceled the postal tax in the first century ad , and charlemagne , who centuries later extended the postal network of the romans into italy , germany and france this list continues on the eighth avenue facade louis xi of france , who created what was arguably europe s first national postal system , in 1477 franz von taxis , who in 1490 organized a permanent postal link between nations cardinal de richelieu , whose policies made the french postal service more available to the public in the early 17th century , and pierre d'almeras , who established fixed delivery fees in 1627 and on the west 33rd street facade , there are thomas witherings , andrew hamilton , sir rowland hill and heinrich von stephan , postal legends all mr kendall s far betterknown effort at historical scholarship stretches above the columns on the eighth avenue facade , and since the building was completed in 1913 has become an unofficial motto of the united states postal service loosely translated from herodotus , it begins , neither snow nor rain nor heat where s the aqueduct \? q how did aqueduct racetrack in queens come by its name \? a the track is named for a conduit that runs past the southern end of the field the conduit was built in 1854 to carry water from the reservoirs of the brooklyn water works to parts of queens and brooklyn aqueduct was built in 1894 and renovated in 1959 daniel b schneider drawing \( stuart goldenberg \)
atlanta turner field , alias the ted , is a spiffy new ballpark , but for the mets it has been an outdoor torture chamber until last night in the hope of escaping its chains and leg irons , robin ventura was inserted as the no 3 hitter by bobby valentine after having batted in that slot only five times last season ventura crushed a tworun homer on the first pitch from new york s favorite villain , john rocker , in the eighth inning and the mets won , 64 , on ventura s second tworun homer , in the 10th , off kerry ligtenberg robin s batting third to get glavine out of his rhythm before he gets to mike , valentine explained in the first inning , tom glavine struck out ventura , a lefthanded batter , but mike piazza swatted a tworun homer after ventura s first homer , the braves rallied for a 44 tie , but then ventura lofted his second homer they 're a good team , and they know we 're a good team , valentine said we 're starting to mold the character of this team again at an opportune time the braves' starting rotation is considered vulnerable john smoltz has tendinitis in his pitching elbow he wo n't pitch for four to six weeks greg maddux ca n't pitch until friday because of a damaged big toe kevin millwood , who pitches against kevin appier tonight , had a 1013 record last year even with their stature as the reigning national league champions , the mets know they must beat the braves if they are to ascend , finally , to a firstplace finish in the nl east over the previous four seasons since turner field opened in 1997 , the mets had a miserable 621 record they were 24 here last year , 15 in 1999 \( plus 03 in the nl championship series \) , 06 in 1998 and 33 in valentine s first full season as the manager with a 1513 record at shea stadium over the past four seasons , including a 21 mark in the '99 nlcs , the mets were an overall 2134 against the braves the past four seasons although the mets were in the world series last year , they did n't have to go through atlanta the mets eliminated the giants and the cardinals , who had bounced the braves over the last decade , the braves finished first in their division nine times and second once \( in 1994 when they trailed by six games before the august strike that canceled the world series \) and while many of their hitters have come and gone over that decade , the braves have continued to win because of a pitching rotation with two constants in glavine and smoltz and the addition of maddux s artistry in 1993 it s the greatest pitching era in baseball history , leo mazzone , the braves' pitching coach , was saying before yesterday s threehour rain delay until glavine and smoltz got here , the old stadium here was known as the launching pad for all the home runs that were hit here , but those two and then maddux destroyed the myth of the launching pad maddux and glavine will go into the hall of fame for longevity , maddux , glavine and smoltz arguably make baseball s best trio of pitchers they entered this season with a total of 510 victories for the braves \( glavine 208 , smoltz 157 and maddux 145 , plus 95 with the cubs for a total of 240 \) the 1954 cleveland indians had three hall of famers in their rotation \( early wynn , bob lemon and bob feller \) plus mike garcia , but feller was nearing the end of his career and wynn had many of his best years with the chicago white sox the yankees won five consecutive world series \( 19491953 \) with vic raschi , allie reynolds and ed lopat , but none are in the hall of fame the los angles dodgers had sandy koufax and don drysdale at their best the yankees that won four consecutive series \( 19361939 \) had two hall of famers , lefty gomez and red ruffing but last night the mets knocked out glavine , and neither maddux nor smoltz will start tonight or tomorrow night maybe all the worms in the outdoor torture chamber have begun to turn with this season s unbalanced schedule that is weighted with more intradivisional games , the mets will play the braves a total of 19 times , roughly a third more than in past seasons if the mets want to finish first , they 're going to have win most of those 19 games tomorrow it s going to start all over again , valentine said and there s a good chance ventura will bat third photo bobby valentine \( gary i rothstein \)
evanston , ill , oct 20 joe paterno and his penn state nittany lions have had their share of firsts this season , none of them good penn state had started its season 04 for the first time in its 115year history and had been handed its first shutout at home since 1965 penn state had kept pace with a good northwestern team , which came into the game ranked 22nd in the associated press poll , never falling behind by more than a touchdown and even taking a 3point lead with 3 minutes 36 seconds remaining but after the wildcats scored with two minutes to play it seemed as if the 74yearold paterno would remain stuck at 322 career victories , one behind bear bryant s major college record with 22 seconds left , however , zack mills , a redshirt freshman quarterback , threw a 4yard pass to eric mccoo to rally the nittany lions to a 3835 victory paterno had sent in mills with less than two minutes left to replace the injured junior matt senneca , who rushed for 27 yards and 2 touchdowns and passed for 234 yards and a touchdown mills moved the team 69 yards over 13 plays to give penn state \( 14 over all , 13 big ten \) its first victory and paterno a share of the record this just goes to show he s still got it in him , mills said he has n't said a word about the record all season people do n't see us in practice and know how hard we work to paterno , tying bryant s career record was not as important as the confidence boost the victory gave his team , which has struggled to show a presence on the field i'm just excited for this football team , he said they needed this i have been trying for so long to convince them that they are a good football team if penn state had lost today , paterno said , it would have been a very , very difficult job to convince them they are good for the first time this season , penn state scored in the first half of a game northwestern \( 42 , 22 \) took a 70 lead on quarterback zak kustok s 9yard run in the first quarter but four minutes into the second quarter , senneca connected with mccoo for a 16yard touchdown and a 77 tie northwestern scored on a 14yard kustok run with 6 22 left in the second quarter , but penn state tied it again on mccoo s 7yard run it was the lions' first rushing touchdown this season the nittany lions finished the first half with only 95 yards rushing , but it was their running game that kept them going in the second half they finished with 213 yards rushing northwestern had 229 yards rushing northwestern went ahead , 2114 , just before halftime on a 44yard touchdown pass from kustok to sam simmons but penn state tied it five and a half minutes into the third quarter , when senneca ran the ball from a yard out damien anderson scored from the 3 to put northwestern ahead by 2821 then with five seconds left in the third quarter , senneca tied the score again with a 1yard touchdown run a 24yard field goal by robbie gould gave the lions their first lead , at 3128 with 2 03 left , kustok made a 1yard run that once again put the wildcats ahead , 3531 after senneca took a hit to the head , paterno , notably hard on freshman quarterbacks , put in mills , who started the lions' last game against michigan , a 200 loss at home i was trying to be calm , said mills , who got a pep talk to calm him from paterno before heading into the game i was a little nervous , but we 've gone through it in practice and i was ready we prepare for stuff like that preparation is exactly what paterno had in mind as part of his victory celebration his plans for when he returns home \? a good stiff bourbon , a nap , then right back to the scouting tapes for his next game , against ohio state photo joe paterno earned his 323rd victory to tie bear bryant s division i record \( associated press \)
athens , nov 23 officials of the international olympic committee expressed cautious optimism today on athens s often maligned preparations to play host to the 2004 summer games in general terms , we have been very positively surprised by the progress made since our last visit in september , said denis oswald , a swiss lawyer who heads the committee s oversight of the athens games in september , oswald and the ioc s new president , jacques rogge , waved danger flags , citing delays in road construction and the building of sports facilities two months later , after a bureaucratic restructuring and another round of national handwringing in greece , the requisite sense of urgency is apparently developing a number of contracts have been signed , oswald said after a twoday visit here by a subcommittee the work has started at different venues obviously , the work that remains to be done is huge , and we should not , because we have a positive impression , neglect or believe we have won this game there is still a lot to do , and it will be a race against the watch until the end of the games gianna angelopoulosdaskalaki , the president of the athens organizing committee , avoided any hint of selfcongratulation the reputation of greeks is that they usually get things done at the last minute , but for those of us in the organization of the games , the last minute is now , she said in normal circumstances , there would be scant international attention paid to the 2004 summer olympics until after the 2002 winter olympics , but athens has proved an exception , because of its role as the ancestral home of the olympics and because of its halting , fractious approach to organizing the former ioc president juan antonio samaranch set the tone early last year , when he said that the light is yellow , meaning that athens was in a danger zone there were serious , though informal , discussions within the ioc about the possibility of moving the games from athens to another city like seoul , south korea , which played host to the 1988 summer olympics but since angelopoulosdaskalaki , president of the group that had bid successfully for the athens games , was named president of the organizing committee in may 2000 , relations with the ioc have improved prime minister costas simitis has also taken a more visible role he consulted with oswald by telephone earlier this week and in person after oswald arrived in athens the twoday meetings focused on the areas identified as most problematic by the ioc accommodations , construction , the operation of the facilities , the olympic village and transportation oswald said that the athens organizing committee had secured 16 , 000 rooms for visitors 13 , 000 in hotels and 3 , 000 on cruise ships but the organizing committee is still 3 , 000 rooms short of its target though angelopoulosdaskalaki has pushed for the construction of new hotels , oswald said that hotel construction needed to begin no later than march or april of next year to be considered a safe solution for 2004 oswald also expressed concern about progress on the center that will stage boxing and tae kwon do and the complex that will be built on the former site of athens s airport oswald also said that the ioc would insist that changes or cancellations to road construction be made only if an alternative were proposed environmental and budgetary concerns have threatened some roadbuilding projects the plan has been made , a master plan , and it s like a puzzle , oswald said take away one piece and it wo n't work one particularly upbeat note in oswald s analysis concerned the olympic village construction began in earnest in early september and , though none of the 366 buildings have been completed , the threestory shells of some structures have begun to emerge a third of those shells are scheduled to be completed by jan 23 , with the entire village scheduled to be completed by nov 30 , 2003 as it is for many people , we only believe what we can see with our own eyes , oswald said it was encouraging to see these houses , and i must say the olympic village is on track once again , i do n't want to give the impression that because we 're satisfied , it will be easy it will be difficult it will be tight

this is one of those nevertoldbefore stories , the result of rummaging through newly discovered archives present events in new york make it timely one night in 1936 , cole porter walked up to a table at the stork club and threw a batch of worthless goldmine stocks in george gershwin s face during the depression , that was a way for popular entertainers to show a lack of respect for one another \( the elegant word dis had not yet been coined \) they would take certificates of stocks that had lost their value in the 1929 crash and hurl them at a person deemed deserving of insult few outsiders knew this , but porter liked close friends to call him l l cole j it seems violence bubbled just beneath the surface of this man who , in public , cultivated an urbane manner and a flair for lyrics that were delightful , delicious and delovely he was way ahead of his time take his use of english fragments like de years later , hiphop artists honored him by taking strange names themselves and twisting da language into new shapes gershwin , known in his own circle as dr g , was also fascinated with new musical forms you remember his rapsody in blue that s what he wanted to call it , but his conservative publisher made him spell it the conventional way in 1936 , dr g and his brother ira \( the notorious ira \) wrote a number called by strauss , which poked fun at rival songwriters it began away with the music of broadway , be off with your irving berlin oh , i 'd give no quarter to kern or cole porter , and gershwin keeps pounding on tin how can i be civil when hearing this drivel \? it seemed innocent enough dr g had even mocked himself but l l cole j took offense those were days of nasty feuds in the music world to add to the menace , entertainers like the singer ruth etting had close ties to gangsters , as the word was then spelled \( the more sophisticated gangstas having yet to arrive \) when l l cole j saw dr g at the stork club with his entourage , he could not contain himself he walked right up to dr g with him was his frequent companion , the musical star irene bordoni , referred to in the tabloids of the day as i bor without a word , l l cole j hurled the stock certificates in dr g s face dr g was enraged you whiffenpoof , he snarled this was a serious insult to show he was down with the common man , l l cole j was softpedaling his privileged background he wanted to erase all memory of a group he had formed years earlier , ywa , which stood for yalies with attitude what happened next became the stuff of legends shots , as they say , rang out three or four people were hit none were really famous , although the wounded did include a talented porter prot g named sidney shacur , a heavy smoker nicknamed twopack shacur with i bor right behind , l l cole j ran out of the nightclub , and jumped into his vintage stutz bearcat he zoomed along midtown streets , running several red lights , until the police caught up with him they found a gun under the front seat l l cole j denied that this gat \( to use the quaint parlance of the day \) was his but others insisted that they had seen a gun tucked in his belt at the stork club and so he was put on trial in the end , he was acquitted he continued to write hits , and even evoked his tangle with the law by calling one of his songs why ca n't you behave \? the truth was that he could be unpredictably explosive friends never forgot his fierce battles with the composer harold arlen def hal who wrote a song called let s fall in love well , those very words formed the refrain of an l l cole j hit from a few years earlier , a number that went by the title let s do it nothing enraged l l cole j more than the thought of being ripped off one night , the two songwriters got it on at el morocco there was a lot of shoving , with threats and awful names exchanged but at least there was no gunplay that time we raise all this now in case you 've wondered why modern celebrities like puffy combs , lil' kim and foxy brown behave the way they do now you know they are just following in the footsteps of giants you did n't think these dim bulbs could invent this stuff on their own , did you \? of course , there was history even before dr g and l l cole j remind us sometime to tell you what antonio salieri did to w a mozart , known in the imperial court as snoop wolfy wolf
minneapolis over a long season , college basketball rarely plays to form there are the dreary days of winter , where overhyped teams are exposed there is the ncaa tournament in the spring , when emotion buoys a littleteamthatcould to an upset but as the ball went up for the opening tipoff last night in the championship game , the consensus was actually accurate duke and arizona were indeed the best two teams in the nation the preseason polls said so back in the fall , which was a neat trick since the associated press started a preseason poll in 1961 , the top two teams have met in the title game three times , and only once since 1966 before last night the coaches , mike krzyzewski of duke and lute olson of arizona , have 14 final four appearances between them and know something about this time of year each insisted that their teams mirrored each other s both had young , talented and thunderboltquick backcourts jason williams , a sophomore , and chris duhon , a freshman , for the blue devils a pair of sophomores , gilbert arenas and jason gardner , for the wildcats each team boasted an inside presence for duke , the bruising 6foot9 carlos boozer overcame a broken foot that kept him out of six games down the stretch arizona s enigmatic 71 center , loren woods , conquered his own penchant for flakiness as the arizona season wore on both teams even brought that rarest of weapons off the bench an unselfish and thoughtful fifthyear senior who was more scholar than athlete duke s nate james will probably be a captain of industry some day eugene edgerson of arizona taught kindergarten last year and is now pursuing postgraduate work at arizona so who was the sharper image of the other \? the blue devils , it turned out , as their 8272 victory gave krzyzewski his third title , all in the past 11 years why \? because a player who did not figure to assert himself did so in the second half mike dunleavy all the important matchups were obscured in a span of 45 seconds dunleavy , a willowy sophomore who had grown 3 inches into his 68 frame in the past two years and often looked as befuddled as a foal trying to figure out his newly sprouted thoroughbred legs , decided he was not as tired and confused as he had looked for most of the tournament it s about time , said dunleavy , whose struggles in the postseason came to a head with a 2of8 shooting performance against maryland in the semifinals i finally made some shots in the second half and was able to give us a little boost somehow we were able to outlast them he was the reason the blue devils outlasted them just over three minutes into the second half , dunleavy opened up the backandforth game with a typical duke spurt he took a pass from duhon for one 3pointer , a bounce pass from battier for another quick flick of the wrist , and converted after a long pass from williams three 3 s and the blue devils were suddenly ahead , 4939 two things were striking each shot was set up by the blue devils' most accurate longrange shooters and dunleavy , the son of the portland trail blazers' coach , who is also named mike , launched them like a player , instead of like the tentative young man who had spent countless hours hearing how coaches play the game this outburst came against arizona s defensive stopper , richard jefferson the wildcats' coaching staff spent much of the past 48 hours noodling with defenses to put jefferson on shane battier and make the coldshooting dunleavy beat them at the last minute , however , they decided to play conventional mantoman defense dunleavy , who scored 18 of his 21 points in the second half , was 5 of 9 from the 3point line we defended their 3point shooters well , jefferson said , and indeed williams , battier and the rest were a combined 4 of 18 i messed up on a few of my assignments and left the side and it kicked out to him he hit 3 , then a couple of them were just scrambling he hit big shots none were bigger , perhaps , than when dunleavy took a pass deep in the left corner with a little over 10 minutes left , tossed a headandshoulder fake , then arched a rainbow through the net to give him 15 secondhalf points duke was ahead , 6151 , and the game s outcome was back in the hands of his teammates who were supposed to win it boozer pushed off woods in the block and batted a touch pass to james cutting along the baseline for a dunk duhon floated right at woods forget that he had blocked the past three shots and made a lefthanded banker and drew the foul he hit his free throw for a 7165 lead when the wildcats mounted one more run , battier , everyone s allamerican , showed why he had collected awards ranging from player of the year to a spot on the academic allamerican team with time running out on arizona , first battier , a senior , knifed between woods and 67 michael wright for a twisting offhanded tipin then , he sneaked down in on the baseline for an authoritative dunk that gave the blue devils a 7772 lead it also gave him 18 points for the night , the final ones of a fouryear career that ensured that he would take a collegiate championship into the professional ranks in the end all the perfect matchups were a push the duke starting backcourt outscored arizona s , 2517 woods got the best of boozer , 22 points to 12 james and edgerson showed why they are a coach s dream with gritty , lowkey play but it was dunleavy , with his secondhalf outburst , that turned all this talk of the perfect reflections into a fun house he showed up no one expected him to
hempstead , ny , sept 12 with some players still waiting to learn of the fates of friends and neighbors after tuesday s attacks on the world trade center , the jets said today that they did not want to play a game on sunday the team is scheduled to play at oakland , and the national football league was expected to make an announcement on thursday about the weekend schedule i do n't even understand why we 're here today , said quarterback vinny testaverde , a native of elmont on long island i think all the games should be canceled this week i'm still waiting on calls i know i 'll get that people were in the building you want to be mourning those people the last thing you want to do is get on a plane to california when you know that all the hijacked planes were going to california my suggestion is if they 're going to play is the only people who have a sayso are owners who have to travel and if so , they have to travel with their team center kevin mawae , the jets' representative to the players' union , said he spoke to the union chief , gene upshaw , in the morning and told him that the jets did not want to play upshaw told mawae that the jets were not the first team he had heard from , and that all the other teams he had spoken to felt the same way upshaw has been in contact with commissioner paul tagliabue to convey the feelings of the players several players were immediately affected by the disaster like many people , testaverde said he had friends and relatives who were waiting to hear from those they thought were at the trade center tuesday morning boomer esiason , a former jets quarterback , has a charitable foundation that had headquarters on the 101st floor of 1 world trade center , the first building to collapse none of the five employees were in the office one player , windrell hayes , was excused today because he could not get back from buffalo , where he went to pick up his wife wayne chrebet arrived about 30 minutes late for practice because of bridge and tunnel delays but the vast majority of players were at practice today many of them were also here on tuesday when they first heard of the attacks coach herman edwards said coaches , who were studying films , were continually checking televisions for updates safety nick ferguson said players left film sessions to congregate in the players' lounge to watch television mawae said that by today it was obvious to everyone that the players shared the sentiment that the games should be postponed players , who fly charter flights to games , expressed fears about the safety of air travel in the wake of the four hijackings tuesday it s hard to say we should be playing , mawae said people in this locker room have neighbors missing our children s friends do n't have moms and dads anymore it s hard to concentrate on football it s probably the least important thing in the world now sitting in a stadium with 65 , 000 people you 're sitting ducks i do n't want to leave my wife and kids what if one of the planes went off course and landed in garden city \? those things run through your mind edwards spoke to the team about the disaster this morning and , although he would not say what his preference was , it was clear his heart was not in preparing for a game he told players that he understood that they would be distracted during today s practice and told them that , if they wanted to talk , he was available edwards said the team had hoped to have a blood drive , but team doctors advised that players should not donate blood so soon before a game instead , the jets will probably make a charitable donation it hits close to home because it s here , edwards said it s different if you 're in green bay or arizona it s different when it s 35 miles away you leave sunday night and go through the holland tunnel and you see the world trade center and tuesday , it s gone it s more real when you see it and you 've driven by it and you try to figure out how could something like this happen i told players it s tough , but we 've got to do it it s no tougher than people looking for their loved ones those people were just going to work just going to work and getting back on the train to come home they 're not coming home it was a thought that haunted the jets as they wrestled with the circumstances of the day i do n't know what the rest of the country feels , testaverde said it s closer to this building than a lot of guys realize i do n't have words to describe how i really feel a lot of things we thought were important yesterday morning do n't seem important today as the days unfold , i know i'm going to hear more bad news in player developments , the jets plan to use tom brandt , their new defensive tackle , at nose tackle , moving steve martin to the other defensive tackle spot and pushing shaun ellis to defensive end in terms of injuries , punter tom tupa \( hip flexor \) and defensive tackle james reed \( knee \) are listed as questionable specialteams player joe todd \( hamstring \) and tackle cornell green \( knee \) are doubtful photo kevin mawae said he told the players' union leader , gene upshaw , that the jets did not want to play sunday \( vincent laforet the new york times \)
seoul , south korea , march 26 clad in traditional costumes fashioned from coarse strands of yellow hemp and wearing tall hats also made of hemp , the six surviving sons of chung ju yung looked like characters from a korean action drama as they gathered on sunday above the open grave of their father staring glumly ahead while laborers shoveled soil into the grave , the sons revealed none of the rivalries that have divided them as they jockeyed for pieces of the industrial empire that their father founded and ruled in autocratic style until illness overcame him the last months of his life for much of the ceremony , the most openly competing sons , chung mong koo , who wrested the automotive division from the hyundai group in bitter feuding last year , and chung mong hun , in nominal charge of the 26 companies still formally within the group , sat next to each other they exchanged neither words nor glances while awaiting their turn to toss ritual shovels of dirt into the grave there is nothing more for them to discuss , said one of the blacksuited , blacktied , whiteshirted hyundai executives who flocked to the burial ground , on a wooded hillside just beyond the urban sprawl surrounding seoul , 20 miles to the west their father settled almost everything he had very little left once a billionaire with controlling stakes in most of his companies , held either directly or through a web of crossholdings , mr chung had distributed most of his assets among his six surviving sons , one daughter and numerous grandchildren long before he died last wednesday at the age of 85 at the time of his death his largest remaining stake was 1577 percent of hyundai engineering and construction , which he had founded in 1947 as the mother company of his empire he left the shares to the company to try to help it stave off extinction his only other holdings , said a spokesman , were tiny stakes in two other companies , including 051 percent in hyundai heavy industries and 028 percent in hyundai merchant marine his sixth son , chung mong joon , owns a controlling stake of 103 percent in hyundai heavy industries , the world s largest shipbuilder chung mong hun clings to hyundai construction with 65 percent of the equity , hyundai merchant marine with 49 percent and hyundai electronics industries with 2 percent crossholdings guarantee that no one outside the family can take control in hostile takeovers , which are almost unknown here last year , chung mong koo , 63 , the eldest of the sons since the death of chung mong pil in a motor vehicle accident nearly 19 years ago , abandoned what he viewed as his rightful hereditary role as chairman of the empire his consolation prize , a controlling stake of about 10 percent in hyundai motor , is now doing well against little domestic competition aides say he is glad to have only car making to worry about chung mong hun , nearly 10 younger than mong hun , does not appear to have been so fortunate although he formally renounced the chairmanship of the hyundai group under government pressure , in a move to professionalize its leadership , he remains de facto chief of almost all but the car companies the problem is that two of the largest , hyundai engineering and construction and hyundai electronics industries , are teetering on the brink of bankruptcy , surviving on loans rolled over at the insistence of government officials chung ju yung s final gesture willing his share in hyundai construction back to the company highlighted the economic turmoil endured by his conglomerate in the final year of his life officials said this seemingly large stake was now worth just 71 billion won , or 55 million , a pittance compared to the company s liabilities of 53 billion the other sons have long since assumed control of their own companies while retaining the hyundai name chung mong keun , at 58 the second oldest , is chairman of hyundai department store , a major retail chain chung mong yoon , 46 , is an adviser to hyundai marine and fire insurance , of which he was once chairman chung mong il , the youngest , who turned 42 on the day his father was buried , is chairman of hyundai finance photo a feud derailed a plan to have chung mong koo and chung mong hun head hyundai \( reuters \)
los angeles , nov 17 faced with a proposal by gov gray davis to trim 843 million from education spending for this fiscal year , school officials expressed fears today that educational reform efforts might fall victim to the cuts we have some momentum of real reform going , said roy romer , superintendent of the los angeles unified school district we understand the budget crunch at the state level , but i hope that there are ways education can be protected to some degree from the proposed cuts on wednesday , governor davis proposed 224 billion in overall budget reductions , including the 843 million for education , for the fiscal year that ends june 30 the state will spend a total of 537 billion this fiscal year to educate more than six million students the steps are intended to help fill a projected 124 billion shortfall in the annual budget of primary concern in urban districts from oakland to san diego was a proposed cut in a program that would provide 197 million in grants to the state s lowestperforming schools , more than 30 million of which was for schools in los angeles these cuts go directly to the kids most in need , said caprice young , the board president of the los angeles unified school district , adding that the district would do what was necessary to stay on reforms other proposed cuts include 250 million intended to cover increased energy costs , 40 million for equalization of financing between urban and rural districts and 50 million for staff performance awards tied to academic improvement several factors have contributed to the budget problems , including the state s energy woes , the demise of internetrelated companies and the sept 11 terrorist attacks governor davis , who has made education the centerpiece of his administration , said he would call a special legislative session in january to act on his proposed reductions the big question is , are these education cuts an aberration or a trend \? said doug stone , a spokesman for the state school superintendent , delaine eastin none of us know at this time california dropped to 42nd in the nation in perpupil education spending in 199596 , from fifth in 196566 , and as the state works to rebuild its educational system , any discussion of cuts is painful still , education officials were measured in their assessment of the governor s proposal the governor is in a tough spot , said scott a plotkin , executive director of the california school boards association we are very pleased that the majority of those funds are coming out of supplemental programs , which are not a part of the core academic or operational budgets of school districts mr plotkin noted , however , that the association was concerned about 75 million in cuts its members believed would come from the base budget of school districts but , he said , the administration was keeping the door open to suggestions we 've had quite a few conversations over the last 24 hours , he said they 've indicated if we have any better ideas , they 'll consider them
chengdu , china by some accounts here , peng denghuai is a selfpromoting scoundrel bent on disclosing to outsiders one of the town s most closely guarded secrets it has nothing to do with nearby military installations or even the recipe for chengdu s famous pockmarked woman s spicy bean curd mr peng knows the trick to changing sichuan opera masks in magically quick succession that is serious business here magical effects have long set sichuan s provincial opera apart from china s dozens of other local opera styles , each of which has its own idiosyncrasies that distinguish it from the better known , more stylized beijing opera none of sichuan opera s special effects are as popular as bian lian , literally face changing , of which mr peng is a master with a flourish of the arms and a twist of the head , he changes his garishly painted mask , again and again and again his 14 masks in 24 seconds was recorded by the guinness book of world records the effect is written into most sichuan operas through characters like a bandit who changes his face nine times to escape his pursuers or an evil sorcerer whose face changes with his moods from the point of view of the audience in a darkened theater , the artifice is indeed magical so much so that it has been registered with the country s state secrets bureau , the government agency charged with keeping track of what is officially clandestine in this secrecyobsessed land but mr peng , who at age 54 already cultivates the patronizing air of an ancient sage , is not content with darkened theaters and has actively sought the glare of brighter lights he wants to teach the trick to andy lau , one of hong kong s most famous pop stars that has outraged china s culture cadres , who say mr lau only wants to use the feat to spice up his sparklerandsmokeembellished stage show most people in sichuan opera circles oppose this , said liu suirong , an official with the chengdu sichuan opera troupe , speaking above the highpitched singing of a recent rehearsal in chengdu s jin jiang theater face changing is what gives sichuan opera its unique character , and if andy lau uses it somewhere else it will mean nothing this is not the first time mr peng has stirred up sichuan opera s staid world in 1998 he caused a scandal by accepting eight girls as students , breaking with the tradition of teaching only men the secret of face changing last year he took his act on the road , performing before television cameras for his worldrecordsetting tour de force though there was no previous record registered for him to break if you just stick to the old rules , the art form wo n't develop , mr peng said recently while eating red peppers and noodles in chengdu that kind of behavior upsets more reserved sichuan opera performers , for whom video cameras are taboo , perhaps rightfully so a close viewing of mr peng s frenzied worldrecord performance , which was taped and played repeatedly on singapore television , reveals bits of colored silk peeking out from the top of his tunic , behind which the masks evidently disappear it is also clear from the video that the masks are yanked from mr peng s face with a system of black strings that would never be seen in the gloom of a theater face changing got its start 300 years ago , when sichuan opera actors began changing the color of their faces during performances by blowing into a bowl of red , black or gold powder , which would adhere to their oiled skin in another method , actors would smear their faces with colored paste concealed in the palms of their hands by the 1920 s , opera masters began using layers of masks made of oiled paper or dried pig bladders , which they could peel one after another in the blink of an eye mr peng takes credit for developing the fullface , painted silk masks used today they can be worn in layers , as much as two dozen thick , and be pulled off one by one face changing is not sichuan opera s only trick the sudden appearance of a third eye on an actor s forehead is another the eye is fixed there in a flash when the actor , in a remarkable gymnastic stunt , kicks his head with his toe , where the gluebacked fake eye has been concealed in another bit of jugglery , an actor balances a candlestick with a lighted candle on his head while rolling around in various contortions the routine culminates with the actor blowing out the candle flame while the candlestick is still atop his head but face changing became sichuan opera s signature spectacle the trick attracted mr lau , whose name is a household word in asia , when he saw mr peng perform in shanghai in 1999 mr lau , known for his white suits and bleached blond hair , approached mr peng after the show to ask if he could learn how to do it too mr peng , with the imperious style of a traditional spiritual master , kept mr lau waiting , though for only half an hour impressed by mr lau s humility a lot of famous people would n't have taken that , mr peng said he agreed to accept the young pop star as his student he printed up business cards carrying a photograph of himself in full operatic costume with young mr lau by his side and though he waived the traditional ritual of having mr lau light incense and kowtow before a portrait of an ancient face changing master , he did call a news conference in beijing at which mr lau kneeled and served mr peng tea the event set off a furor in opera circles the culture ministry was angered because it had not yet approved the apprenticeship sichuan opera aficionados were angered because mr peng was about to breach their code of silence the pressure was so great that i could barely stand it , mr peng said i almost broke down finally , the ministry referred the case to the provincial authorities , saying that face changing had been downgraded from a state secret to a trade secret and so was no longer a concern of the central government and sichuan officials agreed to allow mr lau to learn face changing if he studied all aspects of sichuan opera at the provincial opera school in chengdu mr lau agreed but hong kong pop stars are busy people , and a year has passed since the news conference mr lau has yet to show up for classes mr peng went to hong kong in late december to keep mr lau s interest alive and returned to sichuan with an opera school application form signed by the pop star the school will pass the application on to the provincial culture bureau for approval , mr peng said , adding that mr lau , cowed by all the fuss , avoided any reference to face changing in his application photos peng denghuai , master of the sichuan opera special effect known as bian lian , or face changing , above , adjusting one of his painted silk masks below , he had the makeup on his real face touched up \( photographs by ritz sino rs photos , for the new york times \) map of china highlighting chengdu chengdu is the capital of sichuan , a province known for spicy

when tracy mcgrady bolted toronto to play for the orlando magic last summer , it seemed a precursor to the inevitable departure of vince carter mcgrady , carter s cousin and close friend , was the third individual with star power isiah thomas and damon stoudamire were the others to leave the young franchise high and dry after a fun and fascinating fling but it is beginning to look as if toronto s ill fortune with top talent is about to end after an impressive postseason run and a strong showing on this summer s freeagent market , the raptors seem certain to keep carter , who can become a restricted free agent in july 2002 , in toronto for the bulk of his career the recent lucrative and longterm resignings of the raptors' free agents antonio davis , alvin williams and jerome williams showed carter the club is willing to spend money on its talent and also assured him of being surrounded by friends and able bodies for years to come signing those guys can only help us in our attempts to keep vince , raptors general manager glen grunwald said on friday vince liked playing with those guys and wants to play with them some more i'm optimistic the return of davis is a good omen for the raptors he said during the season that he would have an indepth conversation with carter before resigning a longterm deal , saying that carter s views on remaining in toronto would weigh heavily in his decision the two players did speak before davis signed , and after his fiveyear , 64 million contract was announced , carter s mother , michelle , telephoned davis to tell him how excited she was the raptors may have overpaid alvin williams \( seven years , 42 million \) and jerome williams \( seven years , 408 million \) , but if it helps them retain carter it is worth it while informal talks between carter and the raptors have taken place for at least the past year , toronto can begin official negotiations with him as soon as wednesday under the nba s collective bargaining agreement , the raptors can sign carter to a sixyear extension worth approximately 84 million between aug 1 and oct 31 even if carter refuses to sign an extension , the raptors will not panic and trade him during the season because he will be a restricted free agent next year , toronto will have the right to match any deal carter receives from another team we 're not thinking about trading vince carter , said grunwald , who also has the raptors in the running for the free agent hakeem olajuwon our first priority is to get him signed we think it would be impossible for us to replace a player like vince by forgoing the extension , carter could sign a sevenyear deal worth approximately 120 million with the raptors next summer but he may decide to sign the extension to put himself in position for another huge longterm contract in 2008 , when he will be only 31 years old waiting to sign next summer could decrease the length and amount of money he receives on the final contract of his career in the unlikely event that the above factors fail to persuade carter to stay in toronto , grunwald will resort to psychology , asking his allstar forward why he would settle for owning a city when an entire nation is there for the taking \? vince has already had a tremendous career in toronto , grunwald said and now that vancouver has left canada , he can be the star of an entire country of 33 million people thirtythree million people who would be extra appreciative of the first superstar basketball player who did not spurn them houston awaits a matchup the last time allan houston faced michael jordan , he was a young player defined mostly by potential who was still trying to prove he could star in new york houston was in his second season with the knicks and nearly two years removed from his first allstar appearance but if jordan returns with the washington wizards , houston will square off again with the game s greatest ever on opening night , oct 30 , at madison square garden and the tables will be somewhat turned , with jordan , who is attempting an improbable comeback at age 38 , being the one with something to prove but houston , who recently became the highestpaid shooting guard in league history with a sixyear , 1004 million contract , would not plan on seeing an older , slower , less effective jordan he expects to see the superstar who dropped 55 points on the knicks just a couple of weeks into his first comeback in 1995 the thing about m j is that he s not going to come back unless he s close to the m j of old , houston said i know he wo n't come back unless he s close to that i ca n't see him being better , but you never know with him so i would expect the best i'm sure everybody would look forward to it you always look forward to playing against the best , whether he s 38 or 30 jordan , who is working out in chicago , says he will make his decision in midseptember comeback ruled out sal difazio , the agent for the former nets star jayson williams , called rumors that williams is hoping to return to the nba hogwash williams , who was forced to retire last summer because of a broken right leg , sparked the imaginations of some reporters by competing in highly competitive games at the ymca in somerville , nj , a few days a week he ca n't come back , difazio said he told me the other day that he wo n't be playing for a while because his back was hurting him he said , 'man , i'm getting old' when williams , 33 , retired his doctors said he would be able to play pickup basketball , but they insisted that undergoing the rigors of an 82game season would be all but impossible and even if williams were able to return , it would not be financially prudent williams , who signed a sevenyear , 86 million contract with the nets in january 1999 , has 50 million coming to him if he came back to play , his current contract would be canceled and he would forfeit that money obviously , his health would make signing a similar deal out of the question , so williams would have to play for about 1 million furthermore , when he retired a stipulation was placed in his contract that would forbid him from returning to play for the nets but none of that matters anyway since there is no way williams can come back he runs with a slight limp , difazio said the jayson williams who was running around in somerville was not jayson williams the allstar difazio said that williams has had some trouble coming to grips with the fact that he will never play again he said he spends most of his time attending charity outings , playing golf and riding his motorcycle his new passion , difazio said , is the new jersey storm , the indoor lacrosse team that williams recently purchased he s been more focused on this lacrosse thing than on anything i 've ever seen besides his training and conditioning when he was in the league , difazio said difazio said williams turned down several broadcasting opportunities last season , but he expects him to hit the air sometime in the future can you imagine him and charles barkley together \? difazio said now that s a comeback you can anticipate seeing photo in toronto , vince carter can be a hero to an entire nation \( associated press \)
andreas gursky s giant photographs are so eyepoppingly gorgeous that in this world , where no good turn goes unpunished , even admirers feel compelled to react with suspicion and reserve anything so seductive , so automatically appealing to collectors , so skillfully altered via computer , as some of mr gursky s photographs are to enhance their cinematic irresistibility , must be at least untrustworthy have you ever seen and i do n't mean in reproduction mr gursky s photographs , say , of the trading floor of the chicago board of trade \?

for at least two decades new jersey has struggled to shed its old identity of aging factories , polluted marshlands and suspicious political deals to a large degree , it has succeeded but recently the state has seemed to slide into new ethical problems surrounding its three principal statewide officeholders and an associate justice of its supreme court once again the state has become the focus of criticism and scrutiny by investigators a reminder that new jersey residents must remain vigilant in demanding high ethical standards from their elected and appointed leaders this week the focus has been on the most senior elected official in each of the major parties the state s acting governor , donald difrancesco , a republican , has been ensnared in questions about his past financial practices as a state legislator and as attorney for the township of scotch plains the times disclosed on tuesday that two special counsels for the township , one republican and one democrat , concluded in 1998 that he had violated legalethics rules and should be removed from his job they found that mr difrancesco had lobbied township officials for a zoning change that benefited his family without disclosing his own financial stake ruled on projects involving a home builder shortly after receiving 225 , 000 from that builder and influenced town officials to drop plans for a soccer field on land his relatives hoped to develop mr difrancesco became acting governor after christie whitman resigned to become the bush administration s environmental protection administrator as his problems have mounted , so have democratic hopes for retaking the state house this year mr difrancesco has denied any improprieties , but he has come under pressure within his own party to drop his gubernatorial candidacy the state s senior democrat , senator robert torricelli , is also plagued by ethical questions and investigations into his campaign fundraising , business dealings and personal finances a former political supporter has reportedly accused him of accepting tens of thousands of dollars in cash and expensive gifts , far more than allowed under federal law and the senate s ethics rules the senator has denied any impropriety and angrily charged that federal prosecutors are out to discredit him his supporters suggest dark political vindictiveness by the bush administration two other top officials , one from each party , have faced ethical criticism associate justice peter g verniero of the supreme court , a republican , has come under heavy attack from the state senate for his passive role in investigating cases of racial profiling while he was attorney general several years ago and for his apparent lack of candor in testifying about it during his confirmation hearings and more recently he has been urged to resign from the high court by mr difrancesco , some legislative leaders and this page , among others earlier , the state s junior senator , jon corzine , a democrat , was criticized by this page and by others for his decision to continue holding large numbers of shares at goldman sachs , which he once headed , while serving on the senate banking committee that poses a clear conflict of interest , although he is in compliance with the senate s lax ethics rules in none of these cases has anyone yet been charged with crimes but what is troubling is a pattern of behavior that suggests new jersey may be backsliding from its earlier successes in moving toward more open and responsible government two years ago the almanac of american politics declared that new jersey , once corrupt , is now pretty well cleaned up but if recent events have proven anything , this is no time for complacency
baltimore , june 13 glendon rusch trudged off the mound in the fourth inning tonight , perspiring heavily in the 90degree heat he had suffered another personal setback in his quest to regain last season s form in stepped dicky gonzalez , an unheralded rookie after allowing a single to the first batter he faced to put the mets down by 60 , gonzalez held the orioles scoreless for nearly five innings the mets scored three times in the ninth to tie the game and won , 76 , on tsuyoshi shinjo s twoout hit in the 10th inning but despite the disparity in the performances of their first two pitchers , mets officials said after the game that they would stick with rusch in the rotation and gonzalez in the bullpen gonzalez s performance \( four and twothirds innings , no runs , four hits and no walks \) was all the more impressive because of his inexperience in the role manager bobby valentine hesitated using him in relief because he was unsure how gonzalez would adapt to warming up in the bullpen gonzalez , a 22yearold righthander , said tonight that he has made about 10 relief outings in his career six in the minor leagues \( but none since 1997 \) , one for the mets this season and another handful in the puerto rican winter league he is still new at this but he was warming up in three different innings before finally replacing rusch in the fourth , and he credited the repeated work for loosening his arm enough to pitch he still prefers starting \( he made seven starts for the mets , mostly when steve trachsel was in the minor leagues \) but wants to remain in the majors i think i can work out of the bullpen , gonzalez said i'm more comfortable starting , but i can be a reliever the mets have a habit of coming back for him in gonzalez s most recent appearance as a starter , last thursday , he allowed five runs in five innings to the phillies in a game the mets rallied to win by 65 in the ninth inning gonzalez could provide the mets with a long reliever and spot starter , a role that has gone vacant since pat mahomes left after last season rick white was expected to handle some of those duties , but he has twice been on the disabled list valentine would not automatically label gonzalez his long reliever , but said he would not hesitate so much in calling on him next time it s a nice role for dicky , general manager steve phillips said perhaps that is why the mets are showing patience with rusch phillips repeated tonight that the team did not intend to send him to the minor leagues to work out his problems valentine did not seem that displeased with rusch s performance , despite the constant chatter on the bullpen phone valentine suggested this week that rusch may be suffering from the same adjustment to the new strike zone that has affected several pitchers , most notably the atlanta braves' tom glavine , whose walks have drastically increased this season the new zone extends higher but is narrower rusch s pitching style is often compared to glavine s because both work the outside corners well when they are effective valentine said rusch was just missing the strike zone tonight and needed to get a strike called the manager noted that rusch had repeatedly missed on the outside corner with his fastball rusch , a 26yearold lefthander , has had perhaps the most disappointing season of any met after a breakout year in 2000 the mets had lost his previous three starts , and gonzalez got up in the first inning when rusch fell behind two balls and no strikes to melvin mora , the no 6 hitter mora singled , and rusch escaped the inning down by 20 rusch walked four batters in three and a third innings and was continually behind in the count 40 of his 91 pitches were called balls he left after allowing six runs on nine hits , with his earned run average jumping to 643 opponents are batting 348 against him the four walks gave rusch 20 in 63 innings last year , he did n't walk his 20th batter until july 19 , when he had pitched 113 1 3 innings tonight s performance also raised his earned run average in eight starts on the road to 942 , as against a 260 era in the five starts he has had at shea last year , after winning the fifth starter s job out of spring training , rusch threw at least five innings in 28 of his 30 starts he has lasted that long in only 5 of 13 starts this year

locked in a costly lawsuit with a big pharmaceutical company , igen international was within a few months of running out of cash earlier this year and with biotechnology stocks falling , there seemed little chance of raising money by selling more shares to the public but igen was helped in february by a littleknown new york investment fund called acqua wellington , which agreed to purchase up to 60 million of new igen shares over 28 months igen , a medical diagnostics company based in gaithersburg , md , has already taken advantage of the offer to raise 25 million acqua wellington has offered similar deals to about a dozen biotech companies in the 16 months it has been in existence , creating a stir among executives akin to that of suddenly discovering a rich uncle and no wonder with technology and biotech companies finding it nearly impossible now to sell new stock to the public , money offered by funds like acqua wellington is providing lifelines for many companies such financings are known as private investments in public equities , or pipe s an investor or group of investors negotiates directly with a company to buy shares , often at a discount to the prevailing market price while companies do not like selling their shares at a discount , getting some money is usually better than getting none there s a recognition that pipe s are going to be the only means of financing companies this year and maybe into next year , said brian m overstreet , president of directplacementcom inc , an investment bank that tracks such deals but there is a risk as well some desperate companies agree to such onerous terms that the financing can hurt more than help these are called toxic or deathspiral financings and can result in severe dilution of the value of existing shares , hurting other shareholders the mere announcement that a company has done such a deal can send its stock into a tailspin from which it may never recover intraware inc , a software company in orinda , calif , raised 25 million last june from marshall capital management , the citadel investment group and promethean asset management intraware s stock , which traded above 21 the day before the deal was announced , plunged to near 5 in the next two months , though business issues beyond the financing contributed to the decline we got valued down to the point where many people thought this ship might not make it , peter jackson , the chief executive , said every day you 're tortured by your investors and questioned by your employees this year , intraware raised money from its original venture capital backer and several wealthy individuals to buy out the providers of the financing only about 10 percent of pipe s are toxic , mr overstreet said and some private placements of shares are structured to produce less dilution of existing shareholders than if shares were just sold on the open market private deals can also often be arranged more quickly than public stock offerings , without waiting for the securities and exchange commission to approve a prospectus and without the road show needed to entice investors how can you minimize management time spent running around the world to promote the stock \? asked steven b engle , chairman and chief executive of la jolla pharmaceutical company , which has raised nearly 80 million from three private placements in the last year and a half net2000 communications , a telecommunications service provider in herndon , va , raised 65 million last month in a private placement from existing institutional shareholders and some new ones by obtaining this funding we position ourselves to be one of the survivors , said charlie thomas , founder and chief executive , noting that several rivals have gone bankrupt to be sure , private financings are down substantially this year for the same reasons that public financings are down companies do not want to sell stock , publicly or privately , at today s low prices if they can avoid it , because it dilutes the holdings of the existing shareholders and investors who bought stock in technology companies last year , even at discounted prices typical of private deals , lost money as the stocks plunged , so they are wary now anyone who has a choice does n't want to finance in this environment and anyone who does n't have a choice is n't that interesting to invest in , said roger mcnamee , a managing director of silver lake partners in menlo park , calif , which made private investments last year in companies like the gartner group , a consulting firm , and cabletron systems , a networking company in the first quarter of this year , 25 billion was committed to public companies in 184 pipe s , down sharply from 84 billion in 385 pipe s in the period a year earlier , according to placementtrackercom , a web site run by directplacementcom still , the number of pipe s in the first quarter exceeded the number of stock offerings by already public companies and the decline in tech and biotech pipe s was less pronounced than the decline in stock offerings by public tech and biotech companies pipe s come in many varieties in the simplest deals , an investor or group of investors purchases common stock in other cases they buy debt or preferred stock that can be converted into common stock
katmandu , nepal , june 6 this much is agreed last friday , during the royal family s dinner at nepal s narayanhity palace , crown prince dipendra , 29 , had been drinking heavily he argued with his parents about his marriage plans he retired to his bedroom he returned in a loosefitting military uniform he fired at least one automatic weapon he fatally wounded his father , king birendra , his mother , queen aiswarya , and seven others then he tried to kill himself with a bullet to his temple these are the common elements from interviews with more than a dozen knowledgeable sources friends of the family and top government and military officials , including some who have been briefed by the palace security agency and it is bad news for the average nepalese they thought of their crown prince as a wellbalanced , dynamic kingtobe and are unprepared to accept some himalayan version of the robert de niro character in taxi driver but in the wake of grotesque tragedy , cracks have begun to open in the secret world of nepal s imperial affairs at least 10 people survived the blood bath , and some have spoken discreetly to friends who in turn have spoken indiscreetly to others , embellishing the world s hottest gossip along the way it is hard to know what to believe some published accounts are quite wild on tuesday , in retelling the tale , one indian newspaper described how princess shanti , king birendra s older sister , was decapitated by the spray of bullets , with her head rolling to the ground the truth is undoubtedly wild enough , whatever the truth is in a story circulated today by the associated press , the murdered queen s brother , suraj shamsher rana , provided his understanding of what had occurred he had not been present , but he spoke authoritatively of a lengthy series of events , with the drunken dipendra chasing victims from room to room before entering the garden , where he was confronted by his younger brother , prince nirajan , and his mother nirajan was said to have screamed at his brother , do n't do it , please , kill me if you want dipendra indeed shot him then when his mother tried to hold him back , he shot her as well none of the actual survivors have gone public with their testimony , though today one of them , maheshwar kumar singh , a distant relative , agreed to listen to mr rana s published rendition and urged caution the facts are not correct some yes , but some certainly not , he said , adding that he thought it best for eyewitnesses like himself to talk only to a formal inquiry panel today , the royal palace announced that it would allow the royal survivors to be questioned , an unusual practice that usually offends royal sensibilities nepal is a constitutional monarchy , similar to britain , and while the king has little power over the government , the government has even less over the king but the newly crowned king gyanendra himself appointed the panel , hoping to quell street violence the investigation is expected to begin on friday with a report due three days later , which may finally give this impoverished nation of 23 million people the general story and , more likely , a new set of doubts questions will then begin about who , if anyone , assisted or encouraged dipendra what is sure , however , is that the nepalese will get an unprecedented look at palace life in a kingdom that dates back to the mid1700 s last friday s family dinner was not an unusual event the imperial clan tried to get together for a group meal once a week the most important royals have their own residences within the highwalled palace compound in the center of the capital the main building is the king s others belong to the queen mother and the crown prince once a year , thousands of commoners are allowed inside the grounds so the king can dab their foreheads with vermilion powder the fatal meal occurred in the crown prince s residence in a room known as tribhuvan hall dinner was customarily preceded with cocktails the drinking started about 8 pm not everyone indulged the queen mother did not use alcohol the queen enjoyed sherry many of the men liked a peg or two or three of scotch the group had one notorious drinker , prince paras , gyanendra s son he was the royal bad boy , known for his carousing in katmandu nightspots and eccentric driving he had been involved in four fatal hitandrun accidents , including one that killed a wellregarded singer last year , 500 , 000 people petitioned the king , asking that paras be brought to justice the king vaguely requested more facts , while sweeping the matter under the palace s handmade rugs but last friday it was crown prince dipendra who had overimbibed he had n't waited for the cocktail hour and perhaps had used the whiskey to fortify himself for a fight he wanted to marry devyani rana , the beautiful daughter of a wealthy and influential family indeed , her ancestors , the ranas , and dipendra s ancestors , the shahs , were historically the two families who competed for power as well as intermarrying

wimbledon , england , july 7 in a pocket of brisbane , australia , eight of the nine rafter children jockeyed for bunk space inside a home with a limited number of rooms only one of them had his own room at age 14 , patrick rafter was singled out by jim and jocelyn rafter , and by the siblings who knew there was something special about the thirdyoungest child they all adored tennis , but patrick rafter had the exceptional talent to succeed on the pro level so without jealousy or a hint of sibling rivalry , the furniture was rearranged for rafter in his own room , with his own bed , he could get his rest , contemplate tennis and focus on his game without distraction but this was not the birth of a brat , not the beginning of a pampered prodigy jim rafter would n't have it with the traditional tennis values set by aussie greats like rod laver , john newcombe and tony roche , rafter s father had little tolerance for the twohanded backhand or petulant behavior he made the latter clear the day a teenaged patrick rafter began throwing a fit on the court during a junior match instantly , the young rafter was whisked away by his father and dragged off the court for his bad behavior that s all it took beyond rafter s two united states open titles , and other than his devilish kick serve and slashing volleys at the net , rafter is known for his good nature , his disdain for celebrity and for saying , sorry , mate , whenever he catches a service toss that goes awry on everyone s list for a backyard barbecue , as universally liked as ice cream , rafter is opie taylor with an accent it is no wonder he will arrive for the finals of wimbledon on monday barring an unpredictable rain pattern with good will behind his every chip and charge into the net this is probably his best last chance to take the wimbledon title that has eluded a player with a game suited to be among the grasscourt gods still has n't sunk in yet , rafter said after outlasting the concentration of andre agassi in a 26 , 63 , 36 , 62 , 86 victory during friday s semifinals i do n't want to get too carried away with the whole situation i still have one more match to go by late this afternoon , rafter still was n't sure who he was going to meet in the men s final it will either be britain s great hope , the bookish tim henman , or the wildcard comeback story , goran ivanisevic on friday afternoon , the match between henman and ivanisevic was suspended because of rain today , henman and ivanisevic waited out more sprinkles and played only 51 minutes before play was suspended again the semifinal is scheduled to be completed on sunday , with ivanisevic leading , 75 , 67 \( 6 \) , 06 , 76 \( 5 \) , 32 rafter escaped such torture revealing his amazing reflexes at the net , and an elastic mental resilience , rafter ended agassi s misery after three hours of play , all of which unfolded in the last bit of sunshine to hit the courts on friday afternoon and yet , rafter was n't jazzed by his comeback he was more humbled by the experience , not wanting to boast about the win i think things just went very quickly for andre , said rafter , who was sympathetic to agassi s anger toward the line judges for some questionable decisions i put a little bit of pressure on him and he was still thinking of other things rafter refused to give himself credit but he played an incredible match at the net as well as at the baseline to come back from a break down in the fifth set along the way , he flashed the kind of serveandvolley style that has become endangered on the men s tour , but still works wonderfully for rafter so how can he leave at age 29 \? rafter s plan is to take six months off after the davis cup season ends in december to ponder retirement he will probably head off to his vacation home in bermuda , where he can relax on the beach and poke along the shore on his only form of transportation a moped he s a pretty stubborn bloke , said roche after rafter defeated agassi so i think he means it i think when he s away for four or five months , he 'll either say this is n't such a bad idea or i'm missing it but he s pretty set on having the break if rafter can win wimbledon , he may choose to leave the tour in style after watching his ranking plunge to no 60 two years ago , after recovering from a shoulder injury that had him contemplating an earlier retirement , rafter did what he wanted he proved he could resurrect his career his career circle was nearly completed a year ago , when he led pete sampras in the men s final , up one set and in the secondset tie breaker by 41 after sampras unearthed a historic comeback to win his 13th major title , rafter candidly said he choked now , he has a second chance to relax well , i was saying , 'relax , relax' last time , rafter said with a smile it did n't work maybe i 'll say , 'choke , choke , ' and see what happens perhaps for one last time , he has done the work to reach the final , but he does n't look at this wimbledon opportunity with sappy sentiment i'm just playing it like any other slam , rafter said i do n't feel any pressure to win it rafter does n't need it for his ego , or for the money and with all of the rafter siblings finding professional success in their own ways , the family does n't depend on a single dime from rafter s career earnings of 10 million none of them have been known to ask him for anything in return for the sacrifices they made to support their brother s career , all the way back to his early teen years photos patrick rafter s serveandvolley style has helped him rebound from a shoulder injury and put him in tomorrow s men s final at wimbledon \( associated press \) although he is only 28 , patrick rafter will take six months off to consider retiring from tennis once the davis cup season ends in december \( reuters \)
wnet , channel 13 , the nation s largest public television station , is expected to merge operations with wliw , channel 21 , the long islandbased public television station that is the country s fourthlargest , after a vote by the wliw board yesterday the merger , which would leave the management of wnet in charge of the stations , would be the first of its kind among public television stations executives from the two stations said viewers would see all of the shows they had enjoyed on each station , but without the duplication that now exists they predicted that wliw would retain its separate identity , with even more locally based long island programs the move comes at a time when the cost of upgrading to digital television capability is forcing many public television stations around the nation to consider pursuing joint operations with other stations the number of public television stations is expected to shrink drastically over the next few years as a result of these combinations no money changed hands as a result of the agreement , but wliw executives said the merger would save them as much as half the anticipated 10 million cost of switching to digital service , a move mandated by the federal communications commission to take place by march 2003 wnet has already completed the process at a cost of 30 million and is already broadcasting digital signals i certainly think it makes sense , said terrel l cass , the president of wliw the merger had been strenuously opposed by some members of the wliw board before yesterday s vote in plainview , ny one board member , anne ellis , resigned last week , saying that the proposed combination of the two channels would result in long island residents' being shortchanged in programming related to their community but none of the 25 wliw board members voted to oppose to merger 21 voted in favor , one abstained and three were registered as not present steven rattner , the chairman of wnet , compared the strategy of combining the stations to the recent move by rupert murdoch s news corporation to acquire channel 9 in new york to go along with channel 5 , which he already owned when viewers have more and more choices , it becomes very hard to compete with just one outlet , mr rattner said he pointed to the discovery networks , the cable channel operator they are competitors of sorts of ours and they have four or five channels , mr rattner said the deal must go through two levels of approval first the state attorney general s office and then the fcc mr rattner said he did not anticipate any problems the combined stations would operate along the lines of other entities with multiple channels , like hbo , mr rattner said the plan includes repeating shows from one channel on the other at a different time , crosspromoting programs to steer viewers to programs with similar themes on the other channel , and combining staffs to save money asked if that meant layoffs , mr rattner said that he hoped to reduce the staff through attrition but he said , i 'd be less than candid if i did n't say we hope the combined staff is somewhat smaller than the two have been together mr rattner added that the stations would coordinate some operations like fundraising , which he compared to mr murdoch s combining advertising sales at the two stations he will own in new york wnet initiated the merger talks last november , mr cass said , and wliw was receptive mainly because of the need to convert to digital service the conversion requires a new transmitter and antenna as well as extensive new equipment along with ordering that all broadcast stations switch to a digital system , the fcc has insisted that the stations keep one analog station operating through 2006 both mr rattner and mr cass said the deal included assurances that wliw will retain its local identity mr cass said public affairs programs devoted to long island issues would increase if the deal is approved one other stipulation that wliw insisted be included in the contract , he said , is that channel 13 may not sell the station mr cass will remain president of wliw but he will now report to bill baker , the president of wnet barry shapiro , the current chairman of wliw or a successor if one is in place if the approvals come through will became vice chairman of the stations eight members of the wliw board would be included in the 55member wnet board but wnet , under its parent company , the educational broadcasting corporation , would own the license for wliw as well as wnet
sugar land , tex for anyone who thinks of the united states as a freetrade nation , the 10story brick sugar refinery on highway 90a here on the outskirts of houston is startling the plant can produce up to 500 , 000 tons of sugar a year , enough to sweeten about 90 billion doughnuts but while america has a sweet tooth , it does not need all that sugar indeed , america is swimming in sugar , largely because the sugar business is one of the economy s most protectionist niches sugar programs that protect growers from foreign competition cost american consumers almost 2 billion a year in higher prices for everything from candy bars to cold cereal , according to government studies artificially high prices have led to overproduction , leaving taxpayers the owners of one million tons of sugar that they pay 14 million a month just to store , some of it in sugar land yet earlier this year the owner of the plant here the imperial sugar company , the nation s biggest sugar refiner was forced to file for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection , because it has lost so much money lately turning relatively highpriced raw sugar into the refined sugar it sells into a depressed , glutted market now , refiners are demanding an overhaul of the sugar program consumer groups want it abolished and even its backers and beneficiaries big growers that are major donors to both political parties are dissatisfied they want more protection , complaining that new trade initiatives , like the north american free trade agreement , threaten to undermine the industry and further depress the price of sugar congress is now hearing testimony on these matters as it takes up a new farm bill the conventional wisdom is that washington is unlikely to scrap a program that has bipartisan support , any more than it has been prone to eliminate supports for other farmers but some lawmakers say sugar policy , in particular , is ripe for revision events of the past year indicate that the sugar program is becoming increasingly unmanageable and that radical reforms are needed urgently , said richard g lugar , chairman of the senate agriculture committee and a longtime opponent of the program at the heart of the debate is a sugar policy that since the new deal has held that domestic growers ought to be shielded from the vagaries of the commodity markets the current program , put in place in 1981 , promised that kind of stability by limiting imports and making loans to growers but in recent years , helped by technology and weather , production has exploded and government policies and price supports , on balance , encouraged farmers to abandon even more seriously depressed crops in favor of sugar beets and cane overproduction sent prices tumbling , hurting growers but the hardest hit were cane refiners at times , the prices they paid for raw sugar were higher than those at which they could sell refined sugar if nothing changes , industry officials fear a ferocious onetwo punch the possible loss of canerefining capacity at home , which could hurt food producers , and a steady rise in imports , which could wipe out both domestic growers and refiners freemarket economists say that might be the most efficient outcome , but no industry disappears without a fight the refiners are just one of the interest groups that have stormed capitol hill none are so powerful as the nation s largest producer of raw sugar , the flosun corporation of palm beach , fla , run by jose pepe fanjul and alfonso fanjul , cuban exiles who created a sugar empire in the florida everglades and who are now big donors to both republicans and democrats flosun and other giant producers want to strengthen the program by putting new restrictions on domestic production of sugar beets and cane they also want to limit the scope of any future trade deal that might lead to what they consider unfair competition we do n't believe we ought to sacrifice the american farmer to bring in sugar that is subsidized by other governments , said judy sanchez , a spokeswoman at us sugar , one of florida s biggest cane producers critics of the program from food producers to refiners to consumer groups would like the program discarded or significantly weakened we want the program phased out , said jeff nedelman , a spokesman for the coalition for sugar reform , a trade group that represents food and consumer groups , taxpayer watchdogs and environmental organizations this is corporate welfare for the very rich the program results in higher prices for consumers , direct payments by us taxpayers to sugar growers , and it s the achilles' heel of us trade policy chicago , home of sara lee cakes and brach s starlight mints candies , has aligned itself with the critics a few weeks ago , mayor richard m daley and other city leaders announced that they would lobby congress to end the sugar program , which they said was hurting the city s makers of candy and food by inflating costs indeed , the general accounting office says the sugar program cost consumers about 19 billion in 1998 , with the chief beneficiaries being beet and cane growers
following are excerpts from mayor rudolph w giuliani s address yesterday at the new york city fire department promotion ceremony , as recorded by the new york times we gather on the day after the new york city fire department laid to rest three of its legends chief ganci , first deputy commissioner feehan and our beloved father judge some may wonder why we 're proceeding with a promotion ceremony during such a devastating time of loss the answer is very clear those who were lost and missing would want us to continue they invested their lives and their love in this department they gave their life for it and it s out of sense of profound responsibility to their memory that we must go forward i want you to know that the prayers of every single new yorker , i believe every single american , are with you your willingness to go forward undaunted in the most difficult of circumstances is an inspiration to all of us it sends a signal that our hearts are broken , no question about that , but our hearts continue to beat , and they beat very , very strongly life is going to go on both the life of the city and the life of the department we have very important work to do today , tomorrow , in the months and in the years ahead winston churchill , the leader of wartorn england who saw his country through the battle of britain with bombings every day , once said , courage is rightly esteemed the first of human qualities because it s the quality which guarantees all others without courage , nothing else can really happen and there is no better example , none no better example of courage than the fire department of the city of new york in the last great attack on america , the attack on pearl harbor , the first casualties of that war were the members of our united states navy they wore a uniform like you do in this war , the first large casualties are being experienced by the fire department of new york city the navy regrouped , it fought back , it won the battle of midway and it turned the tide of the battle in the pacific , after it had been devastated the new york city fire department is being reformed today it reminds me of battlefield commissions during a time of war when i was very young , one of the earliest experiences that i remember is my uncle , my mother s younger brother who was a firefighter in brooklyn , being seriously injured when he was thrown from a ladder truck going to a fire , going to a false alarm and he broke both his legs and they thought for a while that he had broken his back and might not be able to walk again and my mother would take me to visit him almost every day at kings county hospital and he was in tremendous pain and one of my earliest memories was his talking about his wanting to go back to work it was the thing that got him through , the thing that sustained him he would talk about how he loved his job and even as a 5 and 6yearold i could figure it out here was a man who had broken both of his legs and maybe his back , and he wanted to go back and he did he had a long career in the fire department , got injured twice more and then retired as a captain and he was one of my early heroes so you 're all my heroes you have been from the time i was a little boy , and from the day that i became the mayor of new york city and i'm heartbroken that we have to add so many , i do n't know how many , to that wall back there i had hoped that there would be no more but we 're going to take out of our hearts' being broken the determination to make this city even more secure , to show to the cowards that wanted to destroy our spirit that , yes , they 've taken some of our most precious lives , but they have not taken our spirit the spirit of democracy is stronger than these cowardly terrorists countries that live under a rule of law agree on being a democracy and respect and care about human life the way the firefighters of new york city care about human life that s what we want that s the future we want for our children , that s the future we want for the rest of the world it s what america has always wanted and it s something that you embody in a way that can be an example to america i would please ask you to stand and join me in a round of applause to the men we 've lost and the men that we 're searching for

washington , oct 24 the comeback begins early this week , the moment an unretired allstar positions himself between allan houston and latrell sprewell at halfcourt the ball is tipped and michael jordan , so often labeled the old man next to the nba s youngsters , will again play his game and dream his dream but an aged , if less visible , man will also be enjoying a renaissance at madison square garden on tuesday night his franchise is suddenly engulfed in the kind of genuine buzz people talking up professional basketball in washington not seen since wes unseld and elvin hayes delivered an nba championship in 1978 i 've heard michael is getting up there , abe pollin , the 77yearold owner of the washington wizards , said i just laugh i'm the old man jordan s second return is laced with all the required amounts of perseverance and desire yet how the game s most accomplished player and the league s senior owner teamed up for the same cause may be a better comeback story it is a tale of fiercely proud and successful men from different backgrounds and generations , realizing they had something in common the will and resources to turn a slumping franchise around the idea that i would ever see michael jordan playing on my team was the farthest thing in the world from my mind , pollin said in an interview last week at his office in the mci center i just did n't think it was possible in december 1998 , during the nba lockout , pollin spoke to the players at a highly charged meeting between each side in manhattan he encouraged players and owners to trust each other as i said 'trust , ' there were some giggles from the players , pollin recalled i said , 'i do n't think that s funny i live on trust i live on a handshake i do n't believe in paper i believe in people' they sort of quieted down at that point , michael got up and said , 'if you ca n't run your team properly , maybe you should sell your team' pollin rose from his seat , almost enraged michael , it s my team and i 'll do what i want with it , pollin recalled saying you or no one else is going to tell me to sell my team more than a year later , jordan , retired from the chicago bulls and itching to be a part of an organization again , arrived at pollin s home to dine with him and his wife , irene he would discuss the possibility of running the wizards and obtaining a minority ownership share over poached salmon and stories , the two men began to see the possibilities and got past their initial reservations about each other the first time he came to my home , we both said 'that s the past forget about that , ' pollin said of the 1998 encounter we shook hands and that was the end of that pollin gave jordan something no other owner would at the time the legal authority to make any decisions he wanted with the team he and i shook hands that he would never do that without consulting with me , pollin said he looked me in the eye and i looked him in the eye 'i 'll never make any deal , mr pollin , without talking to you about it , ' he said around that period , pollin , who purchased his nba team in 1964 a man who had seen the league expand from 9 to 29 teams , who had watched the disturbing influence of player agents and multinational conglomerates grow over threeplus decades began to view jordan as a likable , engaging man whom he could envision turning the wizards around but did i think he would ever play \? pollin said never in my wildest dreams i asked him if he wanted to coach he wanted no part of that it was n't until about six months ago i started seeing a glint in his eye he made it clear to me that he was considering coming back , but he would not come back if he could n't play on the high plane of ability he had played before pollin may take the criticism directed at jordan coming back more personally than jordan himself he referred to a recent newspaper article that he clipped out , saying it basically said 'well , michael is coming back he 'll be good , but the team does n't have enough good players , so they 'll still be rotten' michael , i'm saving that article , pollin said he told jordan i'm going to shove it down that guy s throat when the season is over mr p , do n't read that stuff , jordan replied do n't let it bother you pollin delights in jordan s universal popularity , relating the story of a friend who recently visited poland and learned that none of the children knew the name of the american president but they all knew michael jordan , he said yet the philanthropy of the wizards' owner has made him almost as famous in his hometown you step into a taxicab at reagan national airport and ask the driver what he thinks of jordan s return he s got to do something with his time , said roscoe reeves , a thin , graying man of maybe 70 at least people are talking about the team again asked what he thought of pollin , reeves s eyes lit up oh , mr pollin , what a gentleman i 've known him since he was a young man his father , morris , sold bricks to the builders , and mr pollin worked with him a very socially conscious person , he is

boston , april 13 the chant started inside fenway park after manny ramirez slapped a single past mariano rivera that caused the impenetrable closer to trudge off the mound with his head slumped and catapulted the red sox to a stunning 32 victory over the yankees manny ! manny ! the chant continued rolling onto yawkey way after the game manny ! manny ! the chant surely continued in some locations around this rabid city until last call manny ! manny ! ramirez s tworun single in the 10th inning capped an incredible night between the fierce rivals and allowed ramirez , the newest red sox player , to end a significant drought ramirez had been 0 for 12 with six strikeouts against rivera before he supplied the single that delivered trot nixon and carl everett , made rivera look human , for once , and made the fans perhaps forget 82 years of frustration , at least for a few moments manny , manny had done it i 've never had success against him , ramirez said i guess i got lucky and the ball went through pedro mart nez giddily circled ramirez after the game and playfully asked him to discuss the gamewinning hit , looking more like another delirious fan than a pitcher who had to oppose roger clemens and the yankees in another 15 hours derek lowe predicted that ramirez would get the key to the city boston manager jimy williams wondered what to expect from the next 18 games against the yankees after the scintillating opener left both teams drained and rivera defeated i do n't think we 've ever had any luck off that guy at all , williams said but now the red sox have ramirez , who has made a splashy beginning for the team that felt he was worth 160 million over the next eight seasons ramirez homered on his first swing at fenway during the home opener he drove in all three runs as the red sox edged the yankees , 32 , tonight in his first seven games at fenway , ramirez is batting 461 with 12 runs batted in sure , let the red sox dream of upsetting the yankees while being guided by the kid who could see the lights of yankee stadium from his neighborhood in washington heights i know they 're not going to be worried about it , ramirez said why worry about one loss \? he added , we still got six months to go rivera took a 21 lead into the bottom of the 10th , but singles by nixon and everett and a passed ball put runners on second and third with two out the pitching coach , mel stottlemyre , visited rivera and asked him what he wanted to do rivera emphatically told stottlemyre that he wanted to face ramirez , even though the yankees had an open base and could have pitched to troy o'leary once the count moved to 20 , it appeared more likely that rivera would walk ramirez to ramirez , it was no big deal he said , i was n't thinking about nothing then rivera threw a fourseam fastball that was supposed to be up in the strike zone , but he left it down and ramirez calmly slithered it past the agile rivera nomar garciaparra , the injured shortstop , had advised ramirez to trust his hands and relax ramirez always looks relaxed he s huge , yankees manager joe torre said he s such a big offensive force there s no question he can make up for missing a guy like nomar williams dodged a question about whether he was concerned that the yankees might walk ramirez to load the bases , but everett said he thought the yankees would i guess a lot of people played the law of averages , everett said the law was against manny he s a great hitter and he came through stottlemyre admitted that ramirez is a different hitter than he was with cleveland last year and , while he did not provide specifics , he is probably referring to ramirez having become a tougher out now that he is consistently hitting balls the opposite way ramirez has ripped 237 career homers , but williams complimented him as a hitter who happens to have power yes , ramirez is much more than a slugger williams gushed that ramirez could take batting practice on an ice hockey rink , presumably meaning he has such balance that he would never slip when ramirez was asked if he was being booed or cheered in washington heights , where there might be more yankee fans than ramirez fans , he smiled before saying , it does n't matter he was asked about the possibility of being harassed by some of his friends who are still yankees fans and said , none of them got my cell phone number no phone calls tonight , please only chanting is allowed manny ! manny ! photo manny ramirez of the red sox following through on his gamewinning hit off the yankees' mariano rivera in the 10th inning ramirez had been 0 for 12 against rivera \( associated press \)

get to choose the rules such is the concept of the sudbury school system , a democratic model of education that is being applied at about 25 schools worldwide the greenwood sudbury school is the only one in connecticut there are sudbury schools in australia , england , canada , new zealand , israel and in 14 of the united states they are modeled after the sudbury valley school in framingham , mass , which began in 1968 with the concept that children do not need curriculum , grades , tests or mandatory classes to learn instead , supporters of the school system believe children learn best when they educate themselves through what interests them the most the teachers simply encourage the students in this process in the last year , professors and students from the university of connecticut in storrs , eastern connecticut state university in willimantic , the lisbon branch of sacred heart university and state university new york in new paltz have made the rounds of greenwood , which opened in 1993 on route 97 in hampton a group of seven adults are planning to open a sudbury school in the hartford area and have applied to the state for nonprofit status only three other states california , oregon and colorado have more than one sudbury school i think what appeals to me most about the sudbury model is that children are given the opportunity to pursue things they might be interested in and follow their own curiosity rather than be dictated by the outside world what to learn , said mary panke , a vernon resident and one of the parents who wants to start a sudbury school while other private schools limit teacher control and give students greater responsibility , none do so to the same degree as a sudbury school , said richard reynolds , associate professor of education at eastern connecticut state , who visited the school with his students at greenwood , there are 17 students ages 5 to 19 the annual tuition at the private school is 4 , 000 the school is open from 9 am to 5 pm , monday through friday , but the students choose their own hours perhaps the best example of this student autonomy is the weekly school meeting , the socalled legislative branch of the school government here , each student and teacher gets to vote on such matters as the approval of financial expenditures and development of school policy or laws staff members are elected every may either you 're dead meat or the kids think you are someone they want to be around , said holly rawson , a founder and staff member at greenwood there are only two requirements for students at a sudbury school they must participate in cleanup duties and they must periodically serve on the judicial committee , which acts as a jury to hear complaints regarding infractions of school laws the jury consists of one staff member and four students who serve a rotating twoweek term no one is exempt from this process , not even ms rawson , who was given a warning after forgetting to do a chore ms rawson , who used to run a psychotherapy practice with her husband , was part of a network of parents who taught their children at home they were not unhappy with the content of public schools , but with what they described as a rigid , stifling educational process when a friend asked her to visit the sudbury school in massachusetts with the idea of forming their own school , ms rawson reluctantly agreed she was worried that she would not have time for such a grand project but ms rawson was immediately impressed with what she saw in one of the large community rooms , students of all ages \( sudbury schools do not divide students by age or into grades \) were participating in several different activities some played cards others played with blocks one child was reading a book , while still another was having a snack ms rawson said a couple of students were having some sort of philosophical discussion five minutes after i walked into the door i was literally in tears , ms rawson said i could see my daughter doing this i remember punching randy in the arm and saying , 'all right , i'm in' i believe we are still under the myth from the puritan legacy that people are inherently lazy and that if we do n't teach they are going to be a bunch of lazy , couch potatoes , ms rawson said i believe with aristotle that people are inherently curious if left to our own devices , unimpeded and uncontrolled , we will indeed in time garner all of the skills , wisdom and knowledge necessary to create the perfect lives four ourselves supporters of sudbury contend that their teachers do not have to struggle to motivate children to learn in fact , one parent , barbara giardina , said her son john got upset if he had to miss school because of sickness or a snow day ms rawson said that the students at greenwood had even voted to cancel spring vacation so that they could attend school she added that sudbury graduates have gone on to college and to start their own businesses mr reynolds said the sudbury system tends to produce responsible students but he added that there were potential drawbacks these are children from families who you might describe as avantgarde , new age , mr reynolds said it is based on an existential view of life , that you are the sum total of your choices , in regular school you do n't get too much choice when the bell rings you move from class to class but once you apply morality to the model it does n't work very well morality requires some guidance to tell some 14yearold to come up with moral answers i do n't know if they have the experience and background to do that i wonder if it s expecting too much from kids ms panke said it does require faith on behalf of the parent that a child can be trusted with great responsibilities there are children whose parents will not have enough faith not to intervene , she said for it to work it has to be a 100 percent commitment that you are telling your child you trust them and you have the confidence for them to make their own decisions and back them up on it for that reason alone , mr reynolds does not expect a sudden growth in sudbury schools despite the increased public exposure recently do they have a big future \? he asked i do n't think so it requires such a big adjustment from traditional thinking that for most people it s too much but they have a point if you want kids to be responsible then let kids exercise responsibility photos from left , sean conrad , jeff trask and greg anderson playing a video game in a classroom at the greenwood

hempstead , ny , march 16 despite census figures released this week showing that one in 10 long islanders is hispanic , latinos remain almost invisible in local and county government , political experts agree the disparity , which is roughly the same throughout new york city s suburbs , highlights one of the emerging issues of political life throughout the region while the population is growing increasingly diverse , that diversity is seldom reflected in village or town councils or county legislatures on long island , for example , only one of suffolk county s 18 county legislators is hispanic none of nassau county s 19 lawmakers are few hispanic candidates have been elected to town or village governments , local school boards or even local library boards so when pauline velazquez , the chairwoman of the nassau suffolk hispanic task force , a civic group , lobbied local state lawmakers last month at the group s 13th annual conference at the brentwood country club , it went without saying that none of the lawmakers were hispanic right now we have no one , she said so we 're back at , what do we do \? it was also in brentwood , a hamlet in the town of islip where more than half the population is hispanic , that john velez helped start what he said was long island s first hispanic democratic club two years ago it s about time that we start moving , said mr velez , 58 , who works in insurance it s about time that we start demanding that the clubs open the door it s about time that we start running hispanic people for elected officials it s about time for elected officials to pay attention to us the census figures could hardly come as a surprise to anyone who has ridden the long island rail road lately , or shopped at roosevelt field , strolled around downtown port chester in westchester county or eaten the stuffed corn pancakes known as pupusas that are sold in any of the salvadoran restaurants in hempstead the figures , based on a comparison of the 2000 census count and numbers adjusted by the census bureau for the 1990 census , showed that the percentage of hispanics grew by 54 percent in rockland county , by 56 percent in westchester county and by 61 percent in suffolk county but the figures would come as an enormous shock to anyone who tried to draw a demographic portrait of the suburbs by looking at their elected bodies politicians , civic leaders and analysts point to a number of factors to explain the lack of hispanic elected officials in many areas , they say , new hispanic arrivals may not yet be citizens or may be slow to register to vote and , since the hispanic category on the census encompasses people of different nations , backgrounds , races and opinions , those who do register to vote do not necessarily vote as a bloc then there is the style of local government on long island nearly all the towns are governed by atlarge representatives , rather than by representatives of a specific geographic district this makes it harder for enclaves like brentwood to elect hispanic candidates to the islip town council , since each candidate must win the whole town but the slow pace of growth has frustrated some there is very little representation in the government structure , said agnes rodriguez , a democrat who is running to become a trustee in the village of hempstead in tuesday s elections but there are the bodegas all over the place , run by hispanic workaholics who work 18 , 20 hours a day , and they keep the tax rolls going the only hispanic county legislator on long island does not represent a very heavily hispanic district vivian viloria fisher , a democrat who was elected in 1999 , represents stony brook ms fisher , who was born in the dominican republic and teaches high school spanish , was picked to run for office after she became active in the community as a girl scout leader , a soccer coach and an advocate for breast cancer research as long as hispanic or latino leaders feel that they have to work on quoteunquote hispanic issues , they are going to have a problem getting elected , ms fisher said you have to look at issues that affect long islanders as whole the environment , education you have to represent your whole district still , she said she thought her presence had made a difference on some issues , noting that there has been no more talk of an englishonly law in suffolk county since she has been in the legislature i hope i have had an effect in precluding that kind of bias and feeling , she said some see the growth of the hispanic population here as a continuation of the old patterns of immigrants coming to the suburbs , and slowly gaining political power people always come looking for the american dream , for better homes and better schools , said larry aaronson , chairman of the nassau county democratic party , who said he expected to see more hispanic candidates running for office it s going to have a dramatic effect on the political process here anthony santino , a spokesman for joseph n mondello , the chairman of the nassau county republican party , did not return a call seeking comment about how the island s changing demographics would alter the political landscape mr mondello has noted in the past that his mother was born in puerto rico but in some ways the current influx is unlike past migrations many of the hispanic immigrants now arriving from central america head straight to the suburbs , bypassing the traditional first stop in new york city that gives them special needs , said miriam garcia , the executive director of adelante of suffolk county , a group that provides social services they need special help assimilating , she said , explaining why she thinks it is all the more important for them to marshal political power and some say that the transfer of power from group to group simply takes time robin bikkal , an immigration lawyer who is the chairwoman of the hispanic advisory board for westchester county , said progress was already being made , noting the election of a hispanic family court judge last november and the fact that several hispanic candidates are running for office in local governments around the county i think we 're going through the natural progression politically , she said i do n't think we 're lagging we 're slowly building photo agnes rodriguez , a

washington , may 15 lawmakers in both parties assailed the fbi today for investigative breakdowns , slipshod evidence handling and information control problems that they said had culminated in the bureau s failure to turn over thousands of pages of interview reports in the oklahoma city bombing case any kind of failure at the fbi , anything that happens at the fbi that calls into question something they did or failed to do , leads to a lot of mistrust with the american people , said senator richard c shelby , a republican from alabama and chairman of the senate intelligence committee , after his panel met in a closed session with louis j freeh , the director of the federal bureau of investigation with lawmakers demanding a toptobottom review of the bureau , the law enforcement agency still seemed to be struggling today to account for all documents in its files related to the bombing , which were supposed to have been given to lawyers for timothy j mcveigh under an agreement with prosecutors in the case last week , after the disclosure that the fbi had located 3 , 135 pages of documents that had not been turned over to mr mcveigh s defense team , attorney general john ashcroft postponed mr mcveigh s execution until june 11 to give his lawyers time to review the documents the lawyers for mr mcveigh have said they are considering their options , including asking for a longer delay as more documents have trickled in in recent days from fbi offices around the country , a senior official at the justice department said that government lawyers remained uncertain whether more documents might be unearthed we 're open to it , the official said the issue of the belatedly found documents threatens to damage mr freeh s reputation in his final days as director after eight years in which he has been widely praised in congress mr freeh has said he would resign next month senator orrin g hatch , republican of utah and chairman of the judiciary committee , said he would hold hearings that were likely to have the fbi on the defensive for not knowing what was in its own files there s no question these mistakes should not have been made in a highprofile case , or any case , mr hatch said every criminal defendant has the right to these types of materials and we 've got to live up to our responsibilities , mr hatch said we must see that those rights are protected democrats also demanded change at the fbi senator richard j durbin , an illinois democrat and member of the judiciary panel , said he would propose creating a separate inspector general for the fbi , who would report to congress the fbi has an internal affairs unit , the office of professional responsibility , which reviews complaints of misconduct , but reports to the agency s director the fbi is also under the jurisdiction of the justice department s inspector general , who already reports to congress today , in the first of what are expected to be several days of harsh questioning by congressional committees , mr freeh sought to deflect the furor by repeating his contention that none of the newly discovered documents will cast any doubt on mr mcveigh s guilt but few senators seemed to prepared to accept mr freeh s assurances without specific evidence and the uproar over the documents seemed to crystallize anger about a number of festering complaints with the fbi mr shelby said that mr freeh told the panel today that the documents wo n't have any bearing on the case but the senator seemed unprepared to accept mr freeh s characterization , saying , we 'll have to wait and see it s something that should not have happened , and it shows , probably , a lack of diligence somewhere in the fbi , mr shelby said as fbi director , mr freeh is accountable , mr shelby said , but he added that other bureau officials who failed to respond to repeated internal directives to turn over the documents ought to be brought to task the intelligence committee hearing today also focused on another fbi case of keen interest to mr shelby s constituents , the bombing in 1963 of the sixteenth street baptist church in birmingham , ala , that killed four black girls mr shelby said , from what i 've learned recently , the fbi had information which they never furnished first to our former attorney general , bill baxley , when he reopened the bombing case in the 1970 s , and only recently furnished it to the us attorney s office in birmingham fbi officials said they had discovered in their files audio tapes that were crucial in helping prosecutors win a conviction on may 1 against thomas blanton jr , who long had been suspected of involvement in the crime mcveigh commutation urged \( by the new york times \) boston , may 15 cardinal bernard f law of boston has called on president bush to commute mr mcveigh s sentence to life imprisonment cardinal law has sent a letter to the president with his request , he said , and told reporters that though mr mcveigh had committed a terrible crime , he should not die for it because an execution would not allow a change of mind and heart the cardinal said that he was praying for the president to choose the right path and that the nation would not be well served by the execution photo director louis j freeh of the fbi yesterday after a closed session with the senate intelligence committee \( susana raab for the new

jerusalem last week we and 50 of our colleagues palestinian and israeli political and cultural leaders signed a declaration that was published simultaneously in israeli and palestinian newspapers our declaration did not attempt to solve every aspect of the israelipalestinian conflict rather , at this most tragic and difficult of times in the middle east , it attempted to state unequivocally those principles on which we believe a solution can be based in our statement , we called for an end to bloodshed , an end to occupation , a return to negotiation and the realization of peace between our peoples none of us would have signed this statement if we did not believe its objectives could be achieved even in the midst of ongoing violence , we do not believe we are deluding ourselves when we profess our belief in the fundamental humanity of the other side , or our faith that we do have partners for peace in each other and that a negotiated solution is still possible lost in the noise and clouds of war is the fact that a formula does exist for resolving all the outstanding issues in our conflict the implementation of united nations security council resolutions 242 and 338 , which would lead to the existence of two sovereign national states israel and palestine which would be the fulfillment of the aspiration of both peoples , palestinian and jewish , to statehood based on the 1967 borders , with both capitals in jerusalem israeli and palestinian negotiators made great progress in their discussions of this solution during the talks that took place between november 1999 and january 2001 as two people who participated in the negotiations at taba in january 2001 , we can personally testify to having been extremely , even agonizingly , close to reaching an agreement in our assessment , the main missing ingredient was quality time , as is needed in any negotiation in which both sides must give up what they desire for what is possible over the past year , an impression has been created by some of the participants that the talks at camp david represented the final word on the search for middle east peace this distortion of that event ignores both president bill clinton s ideas offered to us in december 2000 ideas that were welcomed by both sides , with each side having different reservations and the strides forward made at taba that built on these ideas in the taba talks , we progressed , perhaps for the first time , from general principles to specific details , in candid and honest discussions on even seemingly intractable issues like refugees and jerusalem such was the sense of forward momentum at taba that in a joint closing statement , the israelis and palestinians stated that they had never been closer to reaching an agreement and that the two sides are convinced that in a short period of time and given an intensive effort and the acknowledgement of the essential and urgent nature of reaching an agreement , it will be possible to bridge the differences remaining and attain a permanent settlement of peace between them it is time now to pick up where we left off we can build on those discussions and renew that dialogue we have faith that the overwhelming majority of our citizens , both palestinians and israelis , will not only accept such an agreement , but actually yearn for it and understand that it is the only viable solution to the current situation of violence and economic decay there are those on both sides who do not share our vision , and , tragically , who see violence as the route to an absolutist and yet ultimately unachievable and disastrous end unfortunately , time is on their side , not ours the longer we wait before returning to the table and reaching an agreement , the more blood will be spilled , the more hearts will be hardened we must move now to end the dehumanization of the other side and revive the option of a just peace that holds out promise for a future for both our peoples both sides have made mistakes over the past year , but we have had our fill of mutual accusations and blame finger pointing will not point the way to peace the immediate need is for the full implementation of the recommendations of the mitchell committee , including the cessation of violence , a total freeze on settlement activity , implementation of outstanding agreements and a return to permanentstatus negotiations these steps will need to be monitored by an objective third party we and our colleagues have pledged to work together and within our respective communities to rebuild trust and rekindle hope we call on people of good will throughout the world , and especially in the united states , to help us by adding their voices to our pursuit of a permanent peace between our peoples a peace allowing both peoples to live in freedom and security as equal neighbors drawing \( luba lukova \)

eastman kodak has slapped its name on a lexmark inkjet printer hewlett packard now markets digital cameras xerox is introducing a selfservice kiosk to incorporate photographs into documents even as polaroid bets its future on wireless printers what is going on \? a hybrid industry is being born , fed by the widespread use of color in documents , the ease with which people can download imageladen documents from the web , and the rising use of scanners , digital cameras and software that let people route photographs to printers and copiers what is it that you print from the internet a text document with pictures , or a picture surrounded by text \? asked edward y lee , a photography analyst at lyra research that division just is n't cut and dried anymore thanks to digital technologies , the lines are rapidly blurring between industries that deal in words and those that deal in images digital cameras are usurping a growing part of the market for film , and email and other technologies are cutting into the markets for text on paper all the companies have to position themselves in the transmission and communication end of the business , jonathan rosenzweig , an analyst with salomon smith barney , said that certainly was the motivation eastman kodak had when it put patricia f russo , formerly of lucent technologies , into its no 2 spot last week it was why hewlettpackard plucked carleton s fiorina , its chief executive , from lucent in 1999 , and why the xerox corporation grabbed g richard thoman from ibm in 1997 \( although he was ousted last may , just 13 months after becoming chief executive \) and those are just the highprofile hires nearly all the imaging companies have been peppering their staffs with people steeped in the ways of capturing , massaging , transmitting and using data nor is this the first reshuffling in the mid90 s , the advent of scanners , which let printers function like copiers , and of digital copiers , which could be hooked into computer networks and double as printers , erased the lines between copiers and printers printer giants like hewlettpackard and copier kings like xerox moved from parallel players to fierce competitors and now , photography and documentprocessing companies are all selling photocapable printers , and are all offering products that combine pictures and text in effect , they are treating photographs , graphics and text as the same product it s no longer just kodak against fuji and agfa , or xerox against hewlettpackard , said andrew johnson , who follows digital photography for the research firm gartner it s kodak competing against xerox , and kodak both partnering and competing with h p imaging companies readily acknowledge the freeforall the documentprocessing companies are moving into photography s consumer markets , the photography companies are going after documentprocessing s office customers , and everyone is chasing the people who want wireless printing technologies when they 're on the road , sandra b lawrence , chief marketing officer for the polaroid corporation , said the competition is heady , but the winners will win big yes , we are competing with more companies , but it s like going from having 50 percent of a 10 industry to having 1 percent of a multibilliondollar industry , manny almeida , a vice president of fuji photo film usa , said kodak , which will report its quarterly earnings today , has already tried to quantify the new industry last month it began an advertising campaign that posited a 225 billion infoimaging industry , created by the accelerated convergence of image science and information technology according to kodak s research , 656 billion of this new industry is taken up by printers , inks and other items not part of kodak s traditional product line we share this 225 billion market with h p and canon and xerox and lexmark and many others , and none of us have more than an 8 percent share , said carl e gustin jr , kodak s chief marketing officer and that s good , because you do n't want to see a couple of companies grabbing 60 percent and choking off innovation this way , everyone will grow with the rising lake webbased printers are rowing in those waters , too for example , nowdocs inc , which prints and distributes documents it receives electronically , has developed software that lets it print multiple versions of pictureladen documents it is bidding for jobs to produce , say , automotive brochures that substitute pictures of a car in a skiing area , a beach resort , or tooling through midtown manhattan , depending on the target customer s location and interests the trend has already filtered to the retail level camera dealers now routinely sell printers print and copy shops like kinko s are installing photo kiosks , while photo processors are offering copying services our camera and printing divisions are all working together now , because these days , our customers are the same customers , said jeffrey h taylor , business development manager for canon usa his company has consolidated its consumer printing and photography businesses under one chief , and is retraining its salespeople and dealers to persuade corporate customers to buy suites of equipment that include digital cameras , printers and color copiers

almost identical to the one received at nbc the growing evidence supported the notion that the bacteria were being used in a coordinated way but dr david w fleming , the deputy director of the centers for disease control and prevention , said none of the bacteria in the three incidents were resistant to antibiotics i'm glad we 're not dealing with somebody who s developed a resistant strain , said one federal scientist involved in the investigation , who spoke only on the condition of not being named that s a possibility that would 've been very worrisome though more tests remain to be completed , some scientists involved in the investigation , and others familiar with testing techniques involved , said it was likely that the authorities knew much more than they were saying publicly they spoke on condition of anonymity health and human services secretary tommy g thompson said as much in a telephone conference call with reporters yesterday some things may not be able to be released because of the criminal investigation ongoing at the fbi , he said despite the tentative links that appear to exist between the cases , there are puzzling differences in the daschle case , officials said yesterday , more than 30 people were exposed to anthrax spores when an envelope was opened on monday officials said the substance had been produced in such a fine form that it was easily spread through the air in florida , far fewer people appear to have been exposed , even though officials believe that the anthrax also arrived in a letter health officials say only three people have been proved to have been exposed the photography editor who died early this month , and two mail room employees of the publishing company where the editor worked inhalation anthrax has been diagnosed in one of them the other appears healthy in addition , several other employees of american media have shown antibodies to anthrax in their blood , but officials are conducting new tests to determined whether they were truly exposed there is no trace of any anthraxcontaining letter at american media , but employees there remember a letter that was passed among several people , including the photography editor , robert stevens , that contained bluish powder and a star of david several employees say the letter , which was addressed to the actress jennifer lopez , in care of one of american media s publications , arrived on sept 19 the letters sent to mr daschle and mr brokaw were postmarked sept 18 in miami , health officials and a spokesman for the family of a person being tested said yesterday that an 8yearold boy and a former american media intern being tested for possible anthrax exposure now appear not to have come in contact with the bacteria the anthrax bacteria found at nbc has been traced to a letter sent from trenton to the anchor tom brokaw on sept 18 inside the envelope was a threatening letter and a brown substance the letter was opened on the third floor of nbc s 30 rockefeller plaza offices from sept 19 to 25 the woman who opened the letter brushed the substance into the trash a second woman , erin m o'connor , apparently also handled the letter , which was put into a pile of threatening mail last friday , tests showed that ms o'connor had been infected that same day , police picked up the letter from nbc , which had been moved last week from the thirdfloor nbc newsroom to the nbc security office more than 1 , 300 nbc employees have since been tested for anthrax exposure or infection so far , about 850 of those test results are available , including tests of mr brokaw and the employee who actually opened the letter , and in every case so far , the tests have come back negative for infection the results of the remaining tests are expected soon anthrax spores have been found at certain places at the nbc building , including one air filter , but those areas are closed off and are set to be cleaned starting on thursday , while the rest of the building has been deemed safe scientists' ability to identify distinct genetic subspecies or strains of the microbe bacillus anthracis improved tremendously last year when several anthrax experts published a method for discerning telltale patterns in certain segments of the bacterial dna once a sample arrives at the appropriate laboratory , the bacteria must be cultured to provide enough dna to test , but an air force research laboratory recently developed growth media essentially bacteria food tailored to accelerate the growth of anthrax bacteria , but not other varieties several companies now sell equipment that can extract dna from the cultured bacteria in minutes using the new fingerprintstyle method , scientists can compare certain dna segments isolated from the bacteria to a library of dna samples from known strains or from other incidents once you have the dna , we 're talking hours , said dr theresa m koehler , an anthrax expert and microbiology professor at the university of texas medical school at houston who did not participate in that research the analytical work is under way at a farflung set of research centers , including northern arizona university , the los alamos national laboratory and the centers for disease control and prevention scientists there have consistently refused to discuss their findings altogether , out of more than 1 , 200 known strains of anthrax , more than 400 variants have been identified by the geneticists and microbiologists who devised the new dnamatching technique , with anthrax archives established at several universities and federal research laboratories
garden city , ny , dec 14 thomas r suozzi wooed nassau s electorate with such charm and persuasion that despite running as a democrat in traditionally republican territory , he won the county executive race last month by a landslide but since his triumph , mr suozzi has hurt his ascension to power by insulting and threatening some key public figures , his critics and even some supporters say i walked up to extend my hand , said the county legislature s republican minority leader , peter j schmitt he took my hand , narrowed his eyes and says , 'you 're disingenuous' i said , 'what do you mean \? ' he says , 'you know what you did , and i 'll get even with you' that incident and the other disputes came in the wrangling over the recently adopted 2002 budget for the fiscally troubled county one longtime democrat , voicing concern about the tenor of the transition , said , a lot of people are talking about this an official who was criticized by mr suozzi said , i was taken back and i voted for him and a member of his transition team said that mr suozzi was damaging his own cause and was in danger of losing supporters all three spoke on the condition of anonymity some supporters praise mr suozzi s blunt , aggressive style mr suozzi himself insists that he is working cooperatively to solve the fiscal crisis he will try to keep his emotions in check , he said , but he will continue to speak out about what he thinks is right in the battle of the budget , mr suozzi fought for a 15 percent propertytax increase , to ease the county s fiscal situation in his first year in office but vetoes by the retiring county executive , thomas s gulotta , a republican , shaved the increase to 9 percent , which was approved by a state oversight board , the nassau county interim finance authority , over mr suozzi s strong objections he s trying to act like a bully , mr schmitt said he tries to project the image of kennedy , but when you get to know him , he acts like nixon he said mr suozzi was the disingenuous one , because he had promised to save taxpayers 100 million but pushed for a tax increase the day after the election mr schmitt himself is a combative debater who often exasperates the legislature s presiding officer , judith a jacobs , a democrat , who occasionally gavels him out of order but complaints about mr suozzi s temperament extend beyond his rocky relationship with mr schmitt nassau officials , speaking on the condition of anonymity , said mr suozzi made disparaging and retaliatory remarks about the finance authority s chairman , frank g zarb , a republican , and about a democratic member of its board , richard m kessel they also said mr suozzi had cross words with another democrat on the authority , martin payson none of the three would comment the officials also said that in pressing for the tax increase , mr suozzi threatened to denounce mr gulotta every day for the next four years if he did not go along with it , and threatened to call for a fiscal takeover by the financial authority if it did not support more taxes as mayor of glen cove since 1994 , mr suozzi gained a reputation for angry outbursts an aide to mr schmitt , robert lazaro , said that mr suozzi needed anger management therapy during the county campaign , though , mr suozzi displayed selfcontrol in public , even when he was goaded in debates to some extent , mr suozzi s recent actions seem to reflect an effort to show that the new kid on the block is someone to be reckoned with he denied threatening mr schmitt , but said i do think peter schmitt is disingenuous i do n't trust him mr suozzi s advisers said they suspected mr schmitt of telling reporters about the 15 percent tax proposal at a vulnerable stage , after mr schmitt had learned about it in a private conversation with mr suozzi mr schmitt s republican delegation opposed the increase and blocked any hope of overriding mr gulotta s vetoes mr suozzi would not comment on most of his discussions with mr schmitt and other people , saying , i'm going to continue to keep the confidentiality of those conversations private much is being made of these personality issues , but we 've got to solve the budget , mr suozzi said i do n't think i have alienated myself from frank zarb or anybody i need to work with the only one may be peter schmitt , and i say he did the alienating i'm the alienated one i had a great meeting with mr zarb , and he and i pledged to work together to solve this budget crisis , said mr suozzi , who has often vowed to work across party lines in devising the county s fouryear plan a crucial document to avoid a state fiscal takeover he promised he would meet weekly with all major county officials am i going to lose my temper on occasion \? mr suozzi asked yes , i am is that a good thing \? no i'm going to try hard not to am i going to point out when i think something is false or inaccurate \? yes the success i 've enjoyed is in part because i say what i think , and i will continue to be direct and honest two democratic legislators , michael zapson and david denenberg , defended mr suozzi s attacks on mr schmitt and the finance authority , saying it violated its own standards in approving dubious budget changes by mr gulotta peter stabbed him in the back the first chance he got , mr denenberg said mr zapson said i agree 100 percent with tom suozzi what nifa did was despicable , and i'm glad he had the courage to say so the legislature s democratic leader , ms jacobs , said she had not heard insults or threats tom is very passionate in his beliefs , she said he s very honest in expressing his emotions at the moment there is a learning curve the tom suozzi i know has wonderful ideas for the future , and i would hate to see it overshadowed photo thomas r suozzi , a democrat , was elected in a landslide \( joyce dopkeen the new york times \)
on dec 17 , 1903 , orville and wilbur wright made their famous flight at kitty hawk , nc the end result , almost 100 years later , is la guardia airport , which , if dante were alive today , would be bound to have a place in his inferno i can see the lithograph now the damned sitting for eternity in overheated lounges with nothing left to read airhades personnel announcing over and over again that the flight for heaven will leave as soon as really cold weather sets in airplanes are not the only things that fly , however about 2 , 400 years ago , give or take a few hundred , somebody in china sent the first kite , probably of silk and bamboo , into the air the end result , as near as i can see , is that phil napier and his friends are having an awful lot of fun mr napier is a kite flier or , as he happily refers to himself , a kite geek i met him at a small kite festival at jockey s ridge state park in nags head , nc , just down the road from kitty hawk i watched mr napier , who has won a couple of national kiteflying competitions , trace patterns of diamonds and squares and stars in the air with his kite , make it dance to music and coax it to stall just above the ground and gently land , upright , on the surface of a dune it would rest there , poised , until , with a twitch of the lines in his hands , he would launch it again no flights were canceled , none delayed when mr napier gave his demonstration , and when terry murray , a teammate of mr napier s on a synchronized kiteflying team , did a similar , more lyrical flight , the kites seemed alive and full of emotion , like abstract airborne puppets not quite like birds , more like the idea of birds i know it s not fair to compare the deadening experience of flying on commercial airlines with having fun with kites kites do n't have to carry people to business meetings or disney world and i stacked the deck by flying to the festival from one of the worst airports still , i'm not the only one who has been moved by kites to think twice about what the wright brothers did for the world when i called david gomberg , head of the american kitefliers association \( also known , in what i guess is kitegeek humor , as the aka \) , he described the pivotal moment in the history of kites this way almost exactly 100 years ago , a couple of guys from dayton , ohio , went down to kitty hawk , took the strings off their kites and ruined the whole thing or maybe they liberated kites until that time kites were serious business their origin seems to have been in china no one knows exactly when , but there are historical records of an engineer in the fourth century bc who invented a flying wooden bird kites spread from china to become enormously popular in japan and throughout asia they were used for pleasure and cultural celebrations fighting kites were developed in india the chinese also began a long history of building big , powerful kites that could carry people aloft , sometimes to spy on other armies today , socalled power kites are used to pull beach buggies or let kite surfers soar into the air above the waves european and then american experimentation with kites followed much later but by the 18th century kites not only were playthings for children but also were used by the military and as tools for scientific research benjamin franklin s experiment with electricity in 1752 is probably the most famous example the penguin book of kites by david pelham \( called simply kites in new editions \) is full of this sort of fascinating lore my favorite story in the book involves samuel franklin cody he was not buffalo bill that was col william frederick cody samuel did imitate the more famous cody as a western showman for a while but made his real mark with kites really big kites among his feats was a crossing of the english channel in 1903 in a boat drawn by kites eventually cody was recruited by the british army to become \( i did not steal this title from monty python \) chief kite instructor at farnborough unfortunately , he was n't satisfied he turned to powered flight , and died when one of his flying machines crashed as the work of orville and wilbur sank in , kites lost ground as tools for spying , war and science in midcentury they were thought of mostly as children s toys , at least in this country but then modern materials like fiberglass and ripstop nylon , and later carbon fiber poles , made strong , lightweight , massproduced kites appealing to adults stunt or sport kites started to become popular in the 1970 s in the 90 s , mr gomberg said , power kites became all the rage these are big parafoils \( kites with no frame \) that pull buggies along the beach and lift kite surfers into the air that is not to mention hang gliding and parasailing , both kitelike activities as with everything else in america , kite flying can be competitive and , as is the american way , teams and fliers often have sponsors , and behind every kite festival there is usually a kite store but none of this seems to have taken the fun out of kites
london , jan 31 the lloyds tsb group made a third bid today to acquire abbey national , a major mortgage lender , for 198 billion \( 29 billion \) in cash and stock in financial terms , the bid is the same as lloyds s second offer , which abbey national spurned it would exchange 15 lloyds shares and 260 \( 380 \) for each abbey share but the new bid is spelled out in much greater detail , in an attempt to lay the groundwork for a crucial regulatory ruling in the next few weeks to an extent , the fate of abbey national rests in the hands of britain s trade and industry secretary , stephen byers , who is now reviewing both lloyds s takeover bid and a proposed merger between abbey and its preferred partner , the bank of scotland rulings on both offers are expected in february in rejecting the two previous approaches by lloyds , abbey national argued that such a combination would not pass muster with antitrust regulators together , lloyds and abbey would have 29 percent of the country s checking accounts and 225 percent of its mortgages , levels of concentration that have drawn fire from consumer groups also at issue were the price , which abbey directors said was too low , and the business benefits lloyds said it could achieve in a merger , which were criticized as unrealistic christina mills , a spokeswoman for abbey , said it would meet with lloyds later this week lloyds will begin meeting with major abbey shareholders on thursday lloyds has stopped short of a hostile bid , saying it would only proceed if it could win approval from abbey s board and a green light from regulators those stipulations allowed lloyds to avoid setting in motion the strict mandatory takeover timetable , under which a bidder has 28 days to post its formal offer , and shareholders of the target company have 60 days to accept or reject it once the regulatory ruling is in hand , we 'll have to move very quickly said matthew greenburgh , managing director of investment banking for merrill lynch , which is advising lloyds we felt it important to prepare the ground by getting the business case out now lloyds said it expected the merger to generate cost savings and new revenue of 950 million a year though about a fifth of the two banks' combined 2 , 922 branches are within a quarter of a mile of another , none would be closed for two years , lloyds said as for the price , lloyds said its offer was 40 percent above abbey s share price the day before abbey s talks with the bank of scotland were announced in november abbey shareholders would own 28 percent of an abbeylloyds combination it s clear that lloyds can pay the most , and shareholders will be focused on price , said blair stewart , who manages the 750 million scottish value management , which owns shares of abbey national and bank of scotland lloyds also released a preliminary net income figure for 2000 of 27 billion , up 8 percent from 1999 , and said spending on new business development would rise in 2001 there is n't positive news in the earnings outlook , said david townsend , an analyst with goldman , sachs so there is more pressure on them to do a deal
there is some very good dancing onstage at city center this weekend from alicia alonso s ballet nacional de cuba , and a sense of style is not the least of the pleasures ms alonso , who will be 80 next month , joined her dancers for a bow and a standing ovation on thursday night when her company saluted her by performing the magic of alonso , an anthology of excerpts from the 19thcentury classics that were a major part of her career as a star with american ballet theater and elsewhere it is not out of place to recall the living legacy she has passed down to the younger dancers in this program , which runs through tomorrow afternoon this heritage refutes a canard about about the company , namely that it had been influenced by soviet ballet simply because it is in a country ruled by fidel castro ballet nacional de cuba has , however , been ruled by alicia alonso , who founded it in 1960 as an outgrowth of a small troupe she formed in 1948 in havana with fellow dancers from ballet theater to understand the current company is to know that alonso s giselle has many similarities with anton dolin s 1940 version for ballet theater and to recognize in the cuban ballerinas the mix of virtuosity and harmony once special to alonso harmony is the clue the stunning lorna feij o in the grand pas de deux from the sleeping beauty and galina lvarez in excerpts from giselle had no break in their rounded flowing movement and exceptional attention to detail in this company , it matters that the tilt of the head is carefully related to the position of a foot overall , it is a style with echoes of the romantic ballet , especially in the use of retracted arms and amazing soft toe work the look may be oldfashioned to those used to the sharp attack and blazing silhouettes \( uplifted chests \) of soviet ballet and george balanchine but ms alonso was trained at balanchine s school of american ballet in new york and he choreographed theme and variations for her at ballet theater in 1947 what ms alonso , the company s general director , and josefina m ndez , its ballet mistress , evoke here is less a rejection of modern style than a continuity of period style inherent in 19thcentury choreography the men in the company are less stylistically defined and none are on the level of carlos acosta and juan manuel carre o , great cuban dancers who often return to cuba but who now dance mainly in the united states and europe nonetheless , the young joel carre o was a revelation on thursday , full of brilliant potential the other men , if technically uneven , had an innate lyricism the stagings were by ms alonso and with only occasional departures from the usual 19thcentury choreography the scene from act ii of giselle had f lix rodr guez as a romantic hilarion danced to death by a robotic corps the action moved to the adagio that ms lvarez as giselle began , as usual , by herself until victor gil as albrecht partnered her his solo was cut and the beauty of the performance lay in the assemblage of planes in ms lvarez s dancing she began the adagio with her right arm curved above her left , and not en couronne , in a closed circle , as is customary a polonaise from the corps introduced ms feij o as princess aurora in the sleeping beauty excerpt she and oscar torrado , her prince , gave the petipa choreography a sparkling glow and she arched her back when he caught her perfectly in three fish dives good manners prevailed there were no extrahigh extensions and no push in the dancing ms feij o s solo was partly new as was the coda a wan waltz of the flowers introduced the nutcracker with laura hormig n , a longlimbed , streamlined and occasionally gauche dancer who did best in the adagio , nelson madrigal , her cavalier , helped make this pas de deux , based on a ballet russe de monte carlo version , come alive mr gil partnered viengsay vald s , another model of romantic harmony , in the wedding duet from copp lia , introduced by the mazurka from act i the ballerina in this staging often holds her arms folded in a characterdance touch , but classical technique was always well served a spate of bullfighters led by jaime d az and sadaise arencibia , impressive in her line as the street dancer , introduced the don quixote pas de deux the technique was not on a superstar level , but alihayd e carre o s vivacity was matched by the precision and exuberant style of joel carre o there was good work from ms lvarez s nuanced odette , partnered by octavio mart n in the adagio from swan lake , act ii , although a wedge of nasty swans with fluttering fingers looked silly the only non19thcentury excerpt was a jolly parade from ms alonso s sinfonia de gottschalk , to music by the american composer louis moreau gottschalk the score had its premiere in cuba in 1860 photos members of ballet nacional de cuba in an excerpt from swan lake at city center \( tingli wang the new york times \) \( pg a13 \) ballet nacional de cuba

a milestone and an 'ouch ! ' in the next month or so broadway s cumulative box office will break its alltime high , and by the time the season ends with the tonys in early june , it may even break a onceunthinkable figure , 700 million that s an impressive milestone when you consider that the take for the 199899 season was a measly 588 million , then a record as of sunday , the league of american theaters and producers was reporting the current season s total to be 5336 million , up 144 percent from the running total a year ago attendance is also up , with an additional 640 , 000 theatergoers compared with the same period in 19992000 but while attendance is certainly a factor in the box office numbers , there s also a less seemly factor recordhigh ticket prices more than half of the 32 shows on broadway have top ticket prices of 85 or more seven are at or above the 90 mark \( that s nine movies \) the top rate on broadway is for the producers mel brooks fans pay 91 for orchestra and front mezzanine seats , including a 1 restoration fee charged by jujamcyn , the theater s owner \( none of those prices include the fees of services like telecharge and ticketmaster \) the numbers are especially urprising when you consider that two years ago only one show on broadway , cabaret , charged 85 , while for most others the top ticket was 75 theater executives say there are many reasons for the price hikes , including evergrowing production , labor and advertising costs , as well as the dicey odds of recouping one s investment only one in four musicals even break even , let alone ever show a profit , said jed bernstein , the president of the league off broadway prices are rising , too the top price for dinner with friends , at the variety arts , is 65 edward albee s play about the baby , at the century center , is 60 in their defense , producers say they do n't like that they have to charge these rates , even though many theatergoers do n't pay full price the average admission paid this season is

miami , april 8 it was another epic battle that will have fans of sensational drama yearning for a postseason encore there was the early rout that left the knicks so far behind the miami heat that they needed binoculars to get a glimpse of them sprinting away there was the late knicks rally that had the crumbling heat looking fainthearted and haunted by past blown leads there were questionable calls in the last minute by referee joe crawford that may have changed the outcome of the game and there were the flaring tempers knicks coach jeff van gundy was called for a technical and ejected by crawford with 19 seconds remaining and the knicks trailing by 3 points in the end , the heat won , 8176 , surviving their collapse and benefiting from the knicks' cold shooting and crawford s whistle the classic contest at the jampacked american airlines arena moved miami \( 4630 \) one game ahead of the knicks \( 4531 \) with six games left for each team but the knicks , who won the season series , 32 , own the tie breaker and will most likely be seeded third in the eastern conference playoffs if the teams close with identical records if they finish third and fourth in the east , the knicks and the heat will have to reach the conference finals to stage their fifth straight playoff series more than anything , today was proof that a game between the knicks and the heat is guaranteed to go down to the final possessions alonzo mourning , miami s allstar center , who returned from a kidney ailment seven games ago , faced the knicks for the first time this season the knicks' latrell sprewell sat out with a stomach virus , and allan houston , bothered by a bruised right thigh , scored just 7 points and none after the first 30 seconds of the second quarter still , this game was like all the rest you have two teams that know one another s positives and negatives , so i do n't think there s going to be any blowouts , said glen rice , who started in place of sprewell but managed only 7 points on 3of10 shooting i think it s always going to go down to the wire mourning , who was unable to dominate , had just 11 points and 4 rebounds in 25 minutes his four missed free throws in the final 1 minute 13 seconds had the greatest impact i do n't think he was a major factor , said marcus camby , who had 23 points and 15 rebounds i do n't know what he did i know he missed two crucial free throws down the stretch , but he was n't his dominating self against us with camby at his finest , the knicks actually controlled the area near the basket even though the heat often played mourning , brian grant and anthony mason together , the knicks outrebounded miami , 4338 , and outscored them by 3814 in the paint but the knicks were plagued by foul trouble , and the heat led throughout , going ahead by 2813 late in the first quarter and by 4434 at halftime in the third quarter , tim hardaway scored 14 of his gamehigh 25 points and helped miami push its lead to 17 points at the 4 06 mark that s when camby , who aggravated his sore right knee , and charlie ward ignited the knicks camby scored 10 points , and ward had 5 points , 3 assists and 2 blocks during a 174 run that cut the heat lead to 6460 with 10 46 to play the knicks went cold after that , going 4 35 without a basket , and miami pushed the lead to 8 points with 1 40 remaining a key play during that stretch was a missed dunk by camby that was rebounded by kurt thomas after his shot was blocked by bruce bowen , thomas appeared to slam bowen as both players hit the floor while going for the rebound thomas was whistled for a technical foul i really hurt us on that play , thomas said bowen s leg was under mine and i was falling down and i just grabbed him trying to protect myself it did n't look good at all that play should have been a technical , but if i just go down , then it s probably a nocall the knicks surged again , using a fullcourt press , a basket by ward and a dunk and two foul shots by camby to cut the deficit to 7674 with 254 seconds to go the knicks wanted to foul and send miami to the freethrow line , and when bowen got the ball near midcourt , ward charged at him and slapped at his right hand ward lost his balance on the play and flipped over bowen , who did not fall , and crawford ruled it a flagrant foul , awarding bowen two foul shots and the heat the ball crawford left the area without comment just after the final buzzer it may have looked like a flagrant foul , but i tripped when i got there so it may have seemed like i was attacking him , ward said i almost broke my neck trying to get there this is not college van gundy went berserk over the call , badgering crawford for the next minute or so through bowen s free throws , a 20second timeout by the heat and a foul by camby with 204 seconds to play eventually , crawford called a technical and ejected van gundy van gundy , who was ejected for the first time this season , said he did not say much at all to crawford , but he apologized to his players after the game it was a mistake on my part to get a technical foul , he said hardaway sank the technical free throw , and mason hit one of the two free throws after being fouled by camby camby scored a final basket , but two more foul shots by grant with 34 seconds left ended the knicks' hopes and another incredible game between these rivals rebounds allan houston said he hoped to play monday against charlotte glen rice was critical of the play calling , saying he should have gotten more postup plays against the smaller bruce bowen photos

new anthrax alarms shifted away from newsrooms in new york and florida yesterday to capitol hill and gov george e pataki s office in manhattan , reversing roles in the nation s most arresting television drama this time , elected officials on live broadcasts came off as jittery citizens reeling under a sudden intimation of vulnerability television newscasters , many of whom had recently watched their own colleagues be tested and their offices swept , tried to douse undue panic with the sardonic skepticism of anthrax veterans brit hume , a fox news anchor , set the tone , saying dryly that viewers might be a little bemused by contradictory statements about the nature of the anthrax threat coming from the house and senate speaker j dennis hastert of the house set off a morning brush fire by saying that the house would adjourn \( he later reversed himself \) , and describing anthrax spores exploding in a flume and spreading through air ducts in the offices of senate leader tom daschle mr hume then smiled pityingly and said , the senate is confirming none of that , and one has to wonder if his information is up to date on cnn , the anchor aaron brown struggled to make sense of confusing announcements by governor pataki let me just go to sanjay again , he said , turning to cnn s medical expert , dr sanjay gupta , after the governor announced in a live news conference that he felt great , and that he would not seek testing for anthrax , but would take cipro , the powerful antibiotic does that make any sense to you to take the medication but not take the test , because we 've been saying to people for days now , do n't take the medication , just to take the medication \? he asked dr gupta said he agreed it made no sense in any crisis , television produces two clashing effects fear and familiarity yesterday was typical initial bulletins , echoed from station to station and magnified with dramatic graphics , stirring music and flashing icons , inflate each incident into a scary end of the world television moment but , paradoxically , the constant repetition has a way of speeding the acceptance process , forcing viewers to absorb and accept even shocking news quickly television viewers yesterday had another roller coaster ride of bulletins , special reports and live news conferences , but some of the novelty is beginning to wear off over the last eight days , television chatter has incorporated surreal topics such as where to buy gas masks , how to find cipro alternatives and what to do about pure spores and aerosolization \( human nature is also a factor television newscasters , some of whom had unveiled their own anger and emotion over anthrax scares at nbc and then abc , could respond more calmly to the flurry of fresh fear in the nation s capital in the nbc newsroom today , a joke circulated that rival cbs was too low in the ratings to merit an anthrax letter \) almost every news organization in new york has had authorities trooping through checking for anthrax , william shine , network executive producer for fox news , said in an interview his network coined the term spore war to sum up the disagreement between officials over the exact nature of the anthrax traces found in washington people on capitol hill have had less experience and its frightening , mr shine said i am sure senator daschle was concerned about his staff in the sense there was confusion , it came out of concern and a little fear perhaps because there was initial confusion and conflicting information coming out of washington , news anchors sought to stamp down some of the more flimsy reports on cnn , mr brown said aloud what producers in news rooms all over the country debated among themselves we do not know how many other reports are out there , he told viewers i am not entirely sure how many we should report on the cbs nightly news , the anchor dan rather described many officials in washington as confused and told his viewers , as journalists we are doing our best to report reliable information newscasters repeated calls for responsible , cautious coverage from television was perhaps the scariest element all day

security for domestic shipments of surfacetoair missiles , cruise missiles and other explosives has been so poor that terrorists could easily obtain them for use in an attack in this country , according to a classified government report and other confidential records the classified report by the general accounting office found that the lapses in the system for shipping military explosives around the united states by truck were so serious that they posed substantial national security or public safety risks the report , which was issued in july , has gained increased significance as a result of the terrorist attacks on the world trade center and the pentagon since then , government investigators have been fearful that terrorists might be trying to obtain licenses to drive trucks loaded with hazardous materials , which could be used as a weapon but as the report and related confidential records make clear , terrorists could obtain weapons of the american military that are moved and temporarily stored on private trucks with little difficulty some of the unsecured weapons , including handheld rockets , were ready to fire , according to the report others could create explosions that could cost lives and destroy residences and businesses , it says the classified report was also obtained by abc news and is scheduled to be the subject of a broadcast tonight on the program primetime thursday in a separate study , the general accounting office , the investigative arm of congress , also found that the military did not know at times the location of weapons and explosives that were being shipped for example , the investigators found that a shipment of 192 stinger missiles was left temporarily in a civilian storage area without the knowledge of either the military or the contractor who shipped the weapons maj james hutton , a spokesman for the united states transportation command , which coordinates air , land and sea shipping for the military , said that the military could not comment on the reports because they are classified the defense department makes some 40 , 000 shipments of explosives each year , with about 20 percent of those including extremely dangerous items like cruise missiles and handheld rockets such shipments are not always handled by the military itself instead , the defense department hires private trucking companies to move the weapons but the security in the trucking system is woefully inadequate , the congressional report said under the military contract , trucking companies are allowed to leave trucks loaded with weapons in commercial carrier terminals , which the accounting office found have few safeguards to keep deadly weapons away from intruders and are often near residential areas at one terminal , a security guard was watching television in the main part of the building , away from the office where keys to the gates were hanging on the wall , the report says at the time of our visit , the terminal had a shipment of hawk missiles sitting in the yard in temporary storage there are 31 such carrier terminals in 17 states , the report says the terminals are used when a shipment is moved from a shorthaul truck to a longhaul truck , or when a military munitions depot refuses to accept delivery of the explosives because it is a weekend or holiday in examining the security of those terminals , the congressional investigators found that they had been allowed full access to missiles and rockets by doing little more than flashing bogus credentials that appeared to be from the defense department at times , the investigators tried to raise suspicions , but were still not challenged in one instance , the investigators signed in at the carrier terminal using names that were different from the ones on their bogus credentials no one noticed almost every level of security was inadequate , the report concluded gates protecting dangerous material were kept unlocked , it said , and none had alarms to detect intrusion in one instance , investigators found that officials at a site that stored hawk surfacetoair missiles routinely left open a garage door at some sites , the investigators were allowed access to the bills of lading for each trailer , giving them information about which trucks contained explosive and dangerous cargo at the five sites where the accounting office personnel gained access , a full military arsenal was accessible according to the report , investigators found one longrange cruise missile , 11 surfacetoair missiles , 5 antitank rockets , 72 bombs , 14 , 000 rounds for canons and howitzers , and other ammunition and explosives there are few defense department guidelines for the operation of carrier terminals , the report says , and the ones that do exist are often ignored for example , the investigators found that the terminals holding missiles and other explosives were located within 2 , 000 feet of homes and businesses , a violation of safety guidelines that are supposed to be followed by trucking companies that contract with the defense department another regulation requires that such dangerous shipments should not be stored at terminals for more than 100 hours , or a little more than four days again , the investigators found , that rule is routinely ignored for april through june of last year , the report says , 43 percent of the explosives shipped by the defense department were stored in terminals for at least a week and onequarter of shipments held for that time were military equipment that created the highest public risk for a mass explosion , the report found the accounting office concludes , however , that even if all of the applicable regulations had been followed , security risks would still exist because the department s regulations , policies and procedures are fundamentally flawed
mayor rudolph w giuliani announced yesterday that police officers accused of misconduct would no longer be prosecuted by the police department , but by the independent agency that evaluates civilian complaints of abuse the mayor offered few details about the changes , and city officials said it would take months before any plan could be put into place still , it represents a major turnabout for the mayor , once one of the harshest critics of civilian oversight of the police the agency , the civilian complaint review board , would be given expanded powers to charge and prosecute officers that it found had committed misconduct the police department currently prosecutes these cases , which are referred by the review board , a process that has come under fire both from critics of the department and from officers critics have said that police prosecutors too often fail to act on bona fide cases referred by the review board in particular , federal prosecutors in brooklyn have said the disciplinary process has been too weak to curb brutality , and they have been negotiating with the city for 18 months to change the process officers , on the other hand , frequently complain that the disciplinary process is influenced by internal department politics the mayor and his police commissioner , bernard b kerik , unveiled the changes yesterday on mr giuliani s weekly radio show , but they provided few details , aside from their assertions that the plan would not require legislation or the approval of the police unions they said that moving the process outside the department would provide greater accountability and independence , and would increase public confidence i'm not only worried about the cops , mr kerik said in a briefing for reporters after the radio show i'm worried about the communities i'm worried about the public i'm worried about what the public sees when they look at the police department mr kerik said he had been considering the changes for three months , but could not say how much the program would cost or how much the complaint review board s staff of about 200 would be expanded officials said no legislation would be required to increase the board s authority and that a detailed plan of the changes would be ready in 90 days although the responsibility for prosecuting civilian complaints would shift from the department to the review board , the police commissioner would retain the final say on whether officers are punished this decision , as before , would be based on recommendations from the judges who hear the cases mr kerik said that in his fivemonth tenure , he has accepted their recommendations more than half the time officials at the review board learned of the changes only yesterday morning , shortly before the mayor made them public the board released a terse statement , saying its members were pleased but officials of the complaint review board were unable to say what legal mechanism or budget increases would be required to put the changes into effect none of the police unions had been consulted about the changes and the mayor s budget for the next fiscal year , released thursday , made no mention of them what is most disturbing to me is that i am hearing it through the media and that i have never been consulted about this , said lt anthony garvey , president of the lieutenants benevolent association i am not even agreeing that the lba would want to partake in this process i do n't know enough although union officials expressed concerns about what format the new disciplinary system would take , it is not clear that they have any grounds under collective bargaining agreements to block the changes several union leaders said their lawyers were now studying those issues mr kerik said he did not feel he had to consult the police unions before making such a major announcement the unions do n't run the agency , he said this is the department s decision police officials said they hoped the new process would allow the department to stem criticism that it is not committed to disciplining its own the primary criticism has been that only a small fraction of the civilian complaints ever result in serious discipline and that wellinvestigated cases are dismissed for no reason the police department has countered that some of the cases do not go forward because review board investigations fail to collect sufficient evidence with the new plan , the officials said they hoped to demonstrate that when cases are dismissed it is because of the intrinsic problems of prosecuting such cases , and not a lack of commitment from the department it will clear up that perception that we are trying to hide something internally , mr kerik said some of the harshest critics of the department s disciplinary process said they were pleasantly surprised norman siegel , a civil liberties lawyer who played a role in the 1993 creation of the independent review board , said mr giuliani was uniquely positioned to make this sort of broad change he has been identified as being supportive of cops , mr siegel said other political people would be afraid to do this because they would be labeled anticop mr siegel said he had analyzed the costs of adding a prosecution unit to the review board in 1997 he estimated the board would need two dozen lawyers and support staff , at a cost of about 15 million the 13member review board investigates accusations of excessive force , abuse of authority , discourtesy and offensive language brought to it by members of the public , but does not generally handle offenses that rise to the level of criminal wrongdoing the penalties can range from a loss of vacation days to firing under the current system , the review board investigates these complaints and then forwards those it believes have merit to the police department for prosecution those cases which are not dismissed or resolved through plea bargaining are brought for administrative trial the board referred 275 cases to the department in 1999 under the new plan , the review board itself would handle the prosecutions the department s prosecutors would continue to handle cases of misconduct that are developed by the internal affairs bureau and are not the subject of civilian complaints police officials said they were still considering whether there would be any reductions in that staff mr giuliani said giving the complaint review board the added responsibility would make it less likely that the board would vote to substantiate complaints that lacked sufficient evidence we think it will make them more efficient , more effective , the mayor said there will be less of a tendency to charge when maybe there is not enough proof mr giuliani , who opposed the creation of the independent board as a mayoral candidate in 1992 , has recently begun to expand its powers and budget , saying it has grown in competence among the changes has been an increase in the number of investigators , which has reduced what had been a chronic backlog the board is capable of taking on the added responsibility if it is given adequate resources , said mark green , the city s public advocate and a candidate for mayor , whose office has studied the workings of the police disciplinary process for more than a yearthey need to have experienced attorneys with prosecutorial training , mr green said photo mayor rudolph w giuliani and police commissioner bernard b kerik , speaking on the mayor s weekly radio program , announced changes yesterday in a board that investigates complaints about police abuse \( ruby washington the new york times \) \( pg b4 \)

washington , sept 28 president bush said today that the united states was in hot pursuit of both osama bin laden and the taliban forces harboring him in afghanistan senior military officials insisted that there were no american military forces currently on the ground in afghanistan that , however , did not preclude the possibility that they had already gone in and come out those and other officials would not discuss whether intelligence operatives had been in afghanistan recently on reconnaissance or other missions , but one pakistani intelligence official said allied special operations forces had been there he declined to elaborate , but other officials suggested british strategic air service units may have been in the country mr bush said that , while he expected that the american people wo n't be able to see what we 're doing , they should make no mistake about it , we 're in hot pursuit that choice of words may have been intended to deflect criticism from conservatives in congress that his administration is moving too slowly to retaliate for the terrorist attacks or it may have signaled real progress on the military and intelligence fronts about which the administration would have no interest in giving details that might prejudice continuing operations during an appearance in the oval office with king abdullah of jordan , the president also said that the coming campaign against those believed responsible for the sept 11 terrorist attacks would be a guerrilla war mr bush s statement today came as the white house , for the first time since the military planning began , gave a specific description of the administration s political goals in afghanistan , and left little doubt that one objective is the forcible removal of the radical islamic taliban government the taliban do not represent the afghan people , who never elected or chose the taliban faction , said a document prepared by officials of the national security council and the state department we do not want to choose who rules afghanistan , the document continued , but we will assist those who seek a peaceful , economically developing afghanistan , free of terrorism the days when military doctrine centered on the use of overwhelming force to crush a clear enemy appear to be over the president s comments today emphasized the role that special operations forces , rather than conventional military units , are expected to play in the first american military actions to punish mr bin laden and his al qaeda network one defense official said that american reconnaissance forces have set up operations in neighboring uzbekistan this week the united states and pakistan established a joint military intelligence group to deal with what american officials say have been the frustrations of poor intelligence reports emanating from inside afghanistan in his comments today , mr bush made it clear once again that he did not intend to occupy afghanistan , and suggested he had studied the unhappy history of countries that have tried to tame the remote and mountainous land i am fully aware of the difficulties the russians had in afghanistan , he said our intelligence people and our state department people are also fully aware he said it would be very hard to fight a guerrilla war with conventional forces and we understand that the deliberately vague reference to what groups the white house supports to replace the taliban leaves open the question of whether mr bush intends to provide aid to the rebel northern alliance , which has been conducting a stalemated war against the taliban for years , or seek to restore the 86yearold exiled afghan king , muhammad zahir shah he may choose both options there is concern in the white house that too heavy a tilt toward the northern alliance would anger pakistan , a critical but unstable american ally that is hostile to the rebels while some in the administration argue that the king , who has lived in italy for more than a quarter century , would serve as a unifying force among afghanistan s fractious tribes , he might also be regarded as a hapless puppet the army special forces command at fort bragg , nc , has acknowledged that president bush last week ordered its forces to deploy , but military and administration officials repeatedly refused to discuss any aspect of their operations special operations , by their nature , are cloaked in secrecy and deception , making it impossible to know whether the officials who discuss them obliquely are being completely candid it was the legal doctrine of hot pursuit that the united states used to justify chasing pancho villa , the mexican revolutionary commander , into mexico in 1916 , and to invade cambodia in 1970 to pursue vietcong forces mr bush also announced today the release of 25 million in emergency food and medical aid for the refugees flowing out of afghanistan and into pakistan that aid , officials said , is intended to help alleviate the suffering , and to signal to pakistan that the united states will not leave it to handle alone the flood of refugees that will likely accelerate once hostilities begin this is the beginning of the aid , not the end , one official said the united states has been the largest provider of humanitarian aid to afghanistan , roughly 170 million this year but the taliban has ended air flights into and out of the country , crippling aid organizations , and it has harassed aid workers , many of whom have fled the country as the pentagon has amassed a significant force in the region around afghanistan , american military forces have already begun the difficult task of assembling intelligence on possible targets , including mr bin laden s network and the taliban government and military the air force has deployed highflying u2 surveillance aircraft to the region , apparently from prince sultan air base in saudi arabia secretary of defense donald h rumsfeld has acknowledged that an unpiloted american reconnaissance aircraft was lost over afghanistan last weekend , but officials declined to say whether drones like it have continued to collect evidence one of the core missions of army special forces is infiltrating enemy territory and reporting on enemy positions , targets and other intelligence information the army has five major special forces units , including the 5th special forces group based at fort campbell , ky , which has responsibility for the persian gulf region and has frequently trained there in recent years , including in pakistan the white house spokesman , ari fleischer , declined to discuss the activities of american special forces or any operational details of the budding military campaign against those responsible for the attacks on sept 11 he also declined to discuss what mr bush meant by hot pursuit the pentagon continued to build up its forces , drafting still more deployment orders that involve additional troops and aircraft , though none have yet been issued , defense officials said the pentagon also announced that mr rumsfeld had authorized the air force to raise by 7 , 000 the number of national guard and reserve troops it can call to active duty , bringing the total to 20 , 000 from all branches of the armed services , the pentagon has now authorized the mobilization of 42 , 000 reserve troops
on oct 29 , 1999 , ira monas , a long island investment adviser who had been convicted of grand larceny and possession of forged documents in a securities fraud case , entered the adirondack correctional facility at ray brook , ny , to begin serving a term of two to four years as new york state inmate 98a5992 in the next two months , using only a phone in a common room , federal prosecutors said yesterday , mr monas made almost daily calls to two investment firms he owned , directing subordinates who apparently did not know that he was in prison to promote sales of securities in three initial public offerings that were widely regarded as hot investments he called collect , and to mask the raucousness of inmates in the background , he said he was in europe or at a terribly noisy restaurant and while he had no access to the securities he was promoting , federal prosecutors said , about 200 investors sent 85 million to bank accounts he controlled the investors , caught up in a feeding frenzy of internet ventures and ipo s , thought they were buying soaring shares of united parcel service fogdog , an internet sports equipment merchant and freemarkets , an online auction vendor but all they ever got , the prosecutors said , were pieces of paper that appeared to be confirmation slips and officiallooking account statements meanwhile , hundreds of thousands of dollars the investors had sent in went to pay mr monas s personal and business debts , while 42 , 000 was used to buy a mercedesbenz for his daughter and millions more wound up in bank accounts that he controlled , the authorities said none of the investors' funds were used to purchase securities for the investors , mary jo white , the united states attorney in manhattan , said as she released a threecount complaint against mr monas , 55 , of massapequa , ny mr monas appeared before a federal magistrate on friday and was to be released today on a 1 million bond to the custody of his former wife , rita the complaint did not accuse the companies mr monas controlled , or any of his subordinates or employees , of any wrongdoing , and federal officials said it appeared that the employees from securities sales personnel to secretaries who typed up account statements had been misled into aiding his scheme mr monas s lawyer , stephen scaring , would not comment on the case in detail , but said his client has not acknowledged any responsibility for involvement in this complex scheme the government has outlined , but is looking forward to defending himself james flateau , speaking for the state department of correctional services , noted that the state s 71 , 000 inmates were free to make collect phone calls during free time in the common rooms of new york s 70 prisons , and that they make about 22 , 000 calls every day and while it is illegal for inmates to conduct business from prison , catching them doing so is difficult , even though many of the calls are monitored and recorded the case of michael mathie , an inmate at elmira correctional facility who claims to have traded more than 8 million in securities since 1998 and had an adjusted gross income of 899 , 969 in 1999 , was reported earlier this month , but state officials said he had merely managed his own money and had not engaged in any illegal business activity another unusual investor , 15yearold jonathan lebed of cedar grove , nj , turned an 8 , 000 savings bond into 285 , 000 in 1999 and 2000 by using a bedroom computer and the internet to promote stocks he had invested in the securities and exchange commission stumbled onto the boy s case during an investigation into mr monas s dealings mr monas , officials said , had given the boy false information about companies whose stock the teenager had promoted it was that inquiry , officials said , that led to mr monas s conviction and imprisonment in 1999 at the time , said a complaint by a federal investigator , john p keelan 3rd , mr monas was the sole owner of milan capital , a melville , ny , investment advisory service he was also the undisclosed owner of ac financial , a brokerage firm with offices in palm harbor , fla , and pittsburgh , which he acquired through secret transactions that placed a relative in nominal charge , the complaint said in october 1999 , mr monas became one of 700 inmates at adirondack , a mediumsecurity prison mainly for nonviolent offenders he delegated management of milan capital to its vice president , michael lamhut , who was told that mr monas had gone to europe for health reasons during his free time in the common room , mr monas made frequent calls to mr lamhut and instructed him to arrange conference calls with the manager of the pittsburgh branch of ac financial , prosecutors said through these contacts , mr monas gave instructions for promoting the sale of securities in three initial public offerings in late 1999 for ups on nov 10 , for fogdog on dec 9 and for freemarkets on dec 10 each was widely reported in the media as a 'hot' ipo , meaning that they were oversubscribed and the securities difficult to purchase , ms white said monas allegedly told the branch manager of the pittsburgh office that ac financial access to the ipo securities was a result of special relationships that monas had developed with goldman sachs and morgan stanley , the lead underwriters on certain of the ipo s , the prosecutor said neither goldman sachs nor morgan stanley , however , actually dealt with mr monas or his firms as 85 million rolled in from 200 investors , the complaint said , the money was funneled into accounts controlled by mr monas , and much of it was later used to pay his personal and business debts the complaint said about 37 million of the funds was frozen by a federal court as the investigation drew to a close mr monas , after having served less than 17 months , was paroled on feb 15 , state officials said but as he left the prison that day , he was arrested by federal authorities , who were waiting for him , on charges of securities fraud perpetrated while behind bars
the deindustrialization of america in the late 20th century has given birth to a new field , industrial archaeology the national park service , for example , is trying to identify , evaluate and preserve some of the country s important industrial artifacts major factories and mills that are no longer in use these engineering marvels are documented in a new book , industry , architecture and engineering american ingenuity 17501950 by louis bergeron and maria teresa maiullaripontois \( abrams \) the book s vintage photographs record the heyday of the country s steel mills , shipyards and manufacturing plants , although the hardworking men who populated them are largely missing but there are many ways to tell the story of those whose brawn built the american century , one of them being to chronicle the toys they gave their children since 1920 youngsters have cherished the products of the buddy l toy company , founded in east moline , ill , by fred lundahl , who manufactured fenders for international harvester trucks he started by making a toy dump truck out of steel scraps for his son buddy soon after , he started selling buddy l toys for boys , made of pressed steel many were large enough for a child to straddle , propelling himself with his feet others were pull toys a pioneer in the steeltoy field , lundahl persuaded marshall field s and f a o schwarz to carry his line he did very well until the depression , then sold the company while buddy l made sports cars and model t flivvers , most of its toys are miniatures of the vehicles that american men operated at work locomotives , airplanes , buses , tractors , fire trucks and delivery vans from march 9 through 11 , randy inman auctions will put 1 , 300 lots of buddy l toys on the block at the days inn and

has been spreading mr inman said that nearly a thousand toy collectors planned to attend most of his auctions draw about 300 and that he was accepting absentee bids the estimates for the toys run from 50 to 20 , 000 apiece it s hard to predict prices because many of the toys are brand , spanking new and still have their original boxes , he said none of the toys were ever restored or touched up they are right out of the factory while buddy l was not the only company that made pressedsteel toys , its competitors' versions were smaller buddy l made the finest ones , mr inman said he expects the auction to earn from 1 million to 2 million , he said the toys from the company s archives will be auctioned without reserve prices the sale includes individual components of buddy l railroads ,

richard keats , a wellknown new york toy designer who owned buddy l from 1976 to 1990 mr keats went to work for buddy l the day after he graduated from brown in 1948 in our genes , we as adults like all kinds of things when they are reduced to miniature size , whether they are toys , architectural models or patent samples , he said children of course like anything adult that is miniaturized in 1990 mr keats sold buddy l , which is now owned by empire industries of boca raton , fla , and still produces toys during his 52 years at buddy l , mr keats originated new toy ideas and supervised production in east moline , in neosho , mo , and later in asia one of his marketing ideas was to ask national companies to put their logos on the toys firms like buick , firestone , goodyear , wrigley s chewing gum , greyhound , shell and standard oil would pay us for doing their advertising , mr keats said we even got the us postal service although few people had ever seen it , it was known that mr keats had meticulously maintained and updated the company s extensive toy archive , which included the handmade prototypes for toys that never went into production as well as examples of models that did the prototypes are like faberg eggs , mr keats said we had a model of a copper and nickleplated locomotive that was hand assembled with nuts and bolts its wheels move the pistons go up and down it even has a working boiler some of these prototypes took a man a year to 14 months to make no one outside the company saw the archive because it was stored in a concrete building called the morgue in 1976 mr keats moved the contents to a warehouse in clifton , nj he kept the archive after he sold the company , and it has been in hibernation since this inventory will never be duplicated , mr inman said it will be looked back upon as one of the most significant highlights of american toy manufacturing last fall mr keats decided to sell his entire collection because , he said , his storage costs had become prohibitive i had no place to display it and enjoy it , he said it was time to move on he surveyed five auction houses and chose mr inman s he sells more steel toys than anyone else , mr keats said mr inman said the sale was a pretty substantial coup for me mr inman drove an 18foot truck to mr keats s warehouse he loaded it up , mr keats recalled then he filled a van eventually he had to hire another truck , a 54footer , to get all the crates to maine it took seven men five days to unpack the crates at the inman warehouse it was a real walk down nostalgia lane , mr keats said but he is not stuck in the past i'm back designing and developing new toys now , he said they 're just not in steel photo a buddy l tanker , with its original box , part of next weekend

houston there came a moment late one winter afternoon when james turrell s new skyspace in the live oak friends meeting house dramatically altered one s perception of the houston sky as seen through the artist s 12by12foot square opening at the apex of a curving white ceiling , the darkening expanse above seemed to lose all its depth as framed by mr turrell s aperture , this same sky had been transformed into a twodimensional , vividly blue presence that seemed to float just out of reach as the sun continued to set , the skyspace offered more visual surprises for the members of the quaker group , which is based in shady oaks , a suburb of houston one saturday afternoon last december , they were holding their first meeting , a silent hour of meditation , with the aperture of their new home open the now tremulous canvas appeared to lower itself into the 38by38foot room , hovering above the simple benches that are arranged around an open central square mr turrell , an artist who works with light , refers to this effect as bringing the sky down , and says it makes us very aware of our participation in the space indeed , during the period just after the sun set , the image hung so close for such a long time that afterward some viewers recalled being tempted to touch the piece of the sky when questioned about inspiring such actions , mr turrell said he had meant to shake up each viewer s assumptions about his or her place in the solar system here on earth we are moving through space , much more than we are prepared to admit , he said since this installation is in a religious setting , housed in an elegant , simple building designed by the houston architect leslie k elkins , the perceptual changes experienced by viewers take on additional significance the artist s first skyspace the 1986 meeting , a reference to a quaker gathering was at the ps 1 contemporary art center in queens another from the same period is in the collection of mandy and cliff einstein in brentwood , calif the religious potential of the skyspace is only beginning to be understood by the members of the 45yearold association of houston quakers indeed , their first response to the idea was pure apprehension music and art , particularly with religious connotations , are not normally embraced by quakers since they believe that it is in the very stillness of worship that they find illumination , they refuse to entertain any outside prompting , visual or aural if someone had offered us a calder mobile or something in stained glass , or even something in light , we probably would have declined the offer , said jane houser , a member of the group s planning and construction committee that mr turrell was a secondgeneration quaker , and that his participation meant , according to ms houser , that we got our meeting house built , persuaded the group to accept his installation now that it is with them , mr turrell s piece is challenging some aspects of their ministry , including a form of internal worship , part of the friends tradition since it was founded by george fox in the mid17th century in our meeting , we all share a common link that there is a god , said donna dzierlenga , the clerk of the live oak meeting \( the group contributed 475 , 000 to the construction costs of the 12 million meeting house the rest came from houston residents and art patrons \) the language we use for that is 'the inner light , ' she said but it is not physical light thus , mr turrell s dazzling opening , like any external light source , cannot announce the presence of the deity that happens only when members come into contact with the light , most often with their eyes closed at a regular sunday meeting of the group last december , held in temporary quarters at a dance studio in west houston , more than 60 participants sat on metal chairs in a semicircle , their heads bowed for nearly an hour in the main , they kept their eyes firmly shut this use of light as a ministry has a lot to do with the eyes not being open , said mr turrell thus his skyspace should serve as a metaphor for entering a meditative state where the only light show , if any , occurs on the back of closed eyelids but the sheer performance power of the skyspace threatens to change this at the inaugural meeting , none of the group members closed their eyes remaining silent , they kept their eyes fixed on his opening to the sky in subsequent meetings held at night , when the aperture , while not open to the sky , glows with floating , incandescent blue artificial light , members continued to gaze up at it ms dzierlenga remained optimistic that the installation would serve their current method of worship it takes them beyond their daily preoccupations , which is what we need to do as we center , she said mr turrell s skyspace has inspired further changes in the ministry of the live oak friends meeting historically this group has focused its energies in charity hospitals , in silent protests against the persian gulf war , in antiviolence projects now these quakers , who , as one member confessed , knew nothing about art , are the custodians of a work that is drawing crowds since the meeting house opened for limited previews in december , they have found themselves in conversation with such art aficionados as david white , robert rauschenberg s curator and bryant m hanley jr , president of the board of trustees of the dallas museum of art we are making new friends who are coming to see turrell s light and the light within themselves , said ms dzierlenga she expects the skyspace to boost the membership of the small circle of believers \( a recent meeting attracted 265 people \) with the roof open , and more and more viewers looking through , the possibilities of being in the light seem almost infinite photo james turrell s skyspace at the live oak friends meeting house in a houston suburb the 12by12foot central aperture opens to the sky \(

bill clinton walked into an aids fundraiser at the apollo theater in harlem the other night to a flicker of applause and recognition from the audience his wife was in washington , so mr clinton s company for his night out consisted of representative charles b rangel of harlem , the singer roberta flack , and a modest crew of secret service agents the former president spent the next four hours in a cramped center seat , at times chatting with mr rangel and ms flack and occasionally autographing a program that was passed over the seats mostly , though , he was a very famous man who was sitting very much alone that night in harlem captured , in many ways , what life has become for mr clinton in the six weeks since he left the white house whether he is roaming around his 11room home in chappaqua with his dog , buddy , unpacking 120 boxes of books , learning how to use his atm cash card and his new palm pilot , or venturing out of the wooded confines of northern westchester for a night in manhattan , a man who so craves attention and company is described by friends as adrift and often isolated he has lost much of his white house staff , the counsel of many of the people who have guided him through eight years of intermittent crises , and even the daily companionship of his family his wife , hillary rodham clinton , the new senator from new york , essentially lives in washington , and their daughter , chelsea , 21 , is about to head back to college in california mr clinton s friends had warned him of the solitude he would face as he made the adjustment to becoming another spouse of a member of congress , living alone in the suburban house his wife chose when she was running for the senate but the incessant controversy over a series of lastminute pardons has exacerbated his forced isolation many of the people to whom he might turn were involved in either seeking or reviewing the pardons and thus have drawn the attention of congressional and federal investigators several of them , including bruce r lindsey , the former deputy white house counsel , are expected to testify before a house panel today the staff you want to help you out are part of the story , said one of mr clinton s former white house aides mrs clinton was described by friends as torn over her husband s predicament , at once angered that the pardons he granted have tarnished her entry into public life , but distressed that no one is around to help mr clinton deal with the public relations disasters that have marked his entry into private life , or to help him work out of what the family friend described as his funk , at a time when he is pretty much walled up in chappaqua the two clintons continue to share advice , one friend said but that has been complicated by their geographic separation , by suggestions of some of mrs clinton s advisers that she draw some distance from her husband , and by the continuing distraction of mrs clinton s new job , the friend said they have yet to take the vacation together that mr clinton had said they would take at the first congressional recess , now long passed the difficulties of mr clinton s personal transition in ways large but also small , like the times he accidentally cut friends off while trying to place his own telephone calls from his makeshift office have become a subject of increased discussion and concern among his friends , even as they plot ways to rehabilitate his image both mr clinton and mrs clinton declined requests for an interview mr clinton s paid transition staff about 10 people , including schedulers , a correspondence unit , a press secretary , and his longtime personal secretary , betty currie work 300 miles away from chappaqua , out of an office on jackson place across the street from the white house mr clinton has explicitly avoided visiting washington until the furor over the details of his exit subsides , one friend said as a result , he has spent only one night there since he left office , staying with mrs clinton in their new home near embassy row he has yet to visit his transition office for her part , mrs clinton has made it back to new york only on weekends , and not always then in chappaqua , the former president s staff consists of oscar , his personal military valet \( mr clinton s aides have declined to divulge oscar s last name \) who cooks him meals and tends to his clothes and household needs when he travels , he is accompanied by the personal assistant who served the same function for him when he was president after years in which white house operators tracked down whom he wanted when he wanted them , and bid them to wait for mr clinton to come on the line , the 42nd president of the united states now has to make his own telephone calls , from his temporary office at home in chappaqua none of this will change , it seems , at least until summer , when his harlem office should be ready despite the isolation of his private life , he remains an enormous celebrity , especially in new york the very first week that mr clinton was in new york , he attended a performance of aida at the metropolitan opera , where he was mobbed by operagoers but if his appearance at the apollo theater the other night is any indication , there are signs that the novelty may be fading his presence was mentioned only once from the stage , and most theatergoers seemed as impressed at catching sight of ms flack as they were with seeing mr clinton
the connecticut skyline has always been defined by its church steeples , those towers that rise about the trees and give so many of the state s communities their charm but in a 21st century twist , these old spires that were originally built to resemble christopher wren s stone steeples in london are becoming the camouflage to hide microwave antennas for cell phone companies what started slowly just a few years ago is becoming much more common , with church after church in town after town turning over the rooftops to the telephone companies in return , cashstrapped churches not only receive monthly rent from the companies , but also get their steeples , often in desperate need of repairs , renovated for free it is a gift many churches just ca n't pass up we are a very poor church , trying our best to help the people in the community , said the rev allison b cook of st james episcopal church in derby , where verizon wireless installed an antenna in 1997 this was , for us , a gift and it was going to go somewhere despite concerns about the health effects of microwave radiation and the queasiness over letting commercial ventures use their space , about 20 churches have cut deals with the phone companies and more are in negotiation in goshen , for example , sprint pcs spent two weeks in june erecting a 68foothigh antenna inside the clock tower of goshen church of christ congregational the first church of christ , whose steeple had dominated the village of unionville for threequarters of a century until the spire was razed about 50 years ago , finally got a new one last year , courtesy of verizon wireless cingular wireless installed nine antennas at the stamford baptist church that were placed on the columns that support the church bell steeple antennas have also been placed in ansonia , bethel , cromwell , darien , derby , manchester , new haven , new milford , newtown , southport and wethersfield , with more planned in hartford , ridgefield , southington and watertown some communities , such as derby , new haven and southport , have antennas in more than one church indeed , these kind of deals have turned into such a boon for churches , that they have raised tax questions the town of bloomfield , nj , is suing one of its churches in an attempt to collect taxes on the cellular antennas it is housing for voicestream wireless bloomfield is acting under a state law that allows governments to tax churches and other religious institutions for the portions of their facilities leased to profitmaking ventures the connecticut office of policy and management said there is no such tax law in connecticut , although the state is looking into it state senator martin m looney , a democrat of new haven and chairman of the finance , revenue and bonding committee of the state legislature , said committee members have discussed the issue and are considering the extent to which cell phone antennas should be taxed , even those in churches cell phone companies said they were approaching churches because they want unobtrusive places to put their antennas around the northeast , they have been courting churches since the mid1990 s churches are the best looking of the tall structures they have used , which in massachusetts include water towers and another symbol of the region s past , smokestacks from defunct factories the companies want to extend radio signals , and the service that so many people now count on , without building the metal cell phone towers many of those same people hate we always replicate the original design , and we , at times , go to considerable additional expense in order to do historical preservation , adrian paul , a spokesman for sprint pcs , said about the churches we may not always be able to use original materials , but we do keep the design aesthetic that s what voicestream wireless did in ansonia the antennas mounted on the outside of christ church s bell tower are hard to see because a fiberglass covering matches the stone of the structure exactly i went back a year later , and i did n't even know they were there , said brendan sharkey , owner of connecticut zoning and permitting , a hamden company that obtains zoning permits for voicestream one of the more comprehensive renovations transformed the first church of christ in the village of unionville , which is part of farmington since 1885 , the church had been topped by a stone spire that loomed above the village center , but it was torn down in the 1950 s when it began to decay the church had always wanted to build another , but it could not afford to in october 2000 , verizon wireless erected a new steeple , but of steel and fiberglass , not stone , although it was shaped like the church s original spire the new steeple was made of different materials because radio waves ca n't penetrate stone verizon said the new steeple cost more than 500 , 000 to build , but could not be more specific the rev thomas dean , pastor at the church , said his predecessor sought out verizon wireless in 1996 specifically to rebuild the spire
following are excerpts from yesterday s new york 1 new york times debate of the democratic candidates for mayor , as recorded by the new york times andrew kirtzman good evening and welcome to the ny1 new york times democratic mayoral debate i'm andrew kirtzman , and this is my colleague , joyce purnick of the new york times we are coming to you from the studios of cunytv in midtown manhattan so my first question goes to all the candidates maybe we 'll start from my left this time a recent new york times poll shows that new yorkers now hold a more optimistic view of their city and its future than in any time in nearly a quarter of a century you all like some of the things that mayor giuliani has done and dislike some of the things that giuliani has done , but clearly a lot of new yorkers like a lot of the things that rudy giuliani has done as mayor look into the camera and tell new yorkers exactly what aspects of the city you will guarantee will stay the same or get better for the next four years peter f vallone since i 've had the privilege of working with mayor rudy giuliani and his predecessors , mayor david dinkins and mayor edward koch , i worked alongside the three of them and it took not just one person , but it took a lot of work to get the city where it is today , and i like to think that i had something to do with it no mayor can do this alone the mayor has to work very closely with the city council , arrive at a consensus , and i think we did that not only have we adopted 12 ontime balanced consecutive budgets , and not only have we made this city a much safer city , but we also built up a surplus of over a billion dollars for this city to go into the next century , and i think that that s something we should be proud of , without raising a solitary single tax kirtzman so what aspects of city life will you guarantee the voters of new york will either stay the same or get better while you 're mayor over the next four years \? vallone there s no possible way that i would ever let the city become unsafe again since i'm the one that created the safe streets , safe city program , which is responsible for the 10 , 000 cops that we had what mayor giuliani did with those 10 , 000 cops is to come up with a compstat system , which gets the kind of accountability for the police officers to make this not only the safest city in town , but to set an example kirtzman mark green vallone it s the kind of things we should be doing for the other agencies mark green i guarantee that every service will either be as good or better why else would i be running \? i promise you no through no effort of mine will any service get worse there are four areas that count first , a chief executive in new york city , any city , is held up to the standards of is crime down and lower , and are test scores high and higher and so i 'll do everything feasible not only just to keep the good news on crime , but continue the good news on crime by more creative strategies on community policing and swifter , surer discipline so crime goes down with misconduct second , how do you get test scores up \? the board of ed is broken i want to change it by assuming more mayoral control and focusing on smaller class sizes , the instant that kids are biologically ready to learn or not , k to 3 the other two , andrew , are we have to build more housing , not more stadiums unless we have more housing , my daughter wo n't be able to leave home ever and companies wo n't move here because their employees ca n't afford to live here none of this can happen without going beyond rudy giuliani and racially and by borough uniting a city that s been all too divided under him kirtzman guaranteeing that all the city services are going to be better when you finish your mayoralty is a tall order green i did n't say that i said i guarantee that all will be as good or better kirtzman are you willing to guarantee that if they 're not as good or better that you wo n't run for reelection \? green of course not , that s up to the voters to decide joe namath predicted victory when it was brash he won in '68 when the jets beat the colts allow me , in the spirit of joe namath , to predict on running to make the city better by 2010 i'm not looking backwards , andrew , i'm looking forward kirtzman fernando ferrer fernando ferrer undeniably , new york city has gotten better in so many respects in the last eight years , but i do not view the last eight years as an unalloyed success just ask the new yorkers who ca n't find a decent place to live at a price they can afford , or the parents of new york city public school children who are still deeply conflicted about their public schools , finding too many of those children trapped in schools that cannot succeed or the one out of four new yorkers who has no health insurance and no decent and reliable access to health care or too many new yorkers who find themselves on the wrong side of the divide of distrust with their own police department those are the things that need to change to bring this city to the very next level kirtzman what aspects of city life will you guarantee new yorkers will remain at least as good as they are or get better \?
according to the chronicle of philanthropy s annual rankings late last year , the salvation army raised more money than any other charity , for the eighth year in a row , followed by the ymca , the american red cross , the american cancer society and the fidelity investments charitable gift fund yes , fidelity , the mutual fund company nine years ago , with stock prices already into their long climb , fidelity came up with an offer for investors interested in combining philanthropy with their overall moneymanagement plans the idea is simple charityminded donors put at least 10 , 000 into a fidelity fund that distributes money to charities and receive an immediate tax deduction for the full amount if the donation is made in appreciated stock , the donor also avoids capital gains taxes then , whenever the time seems ripe , donors direct fidelity to send checks to any charity , school or religious organization they want to support meanwhile , the money in the fund grows and fidelity gets a fee for managing it fidelity s fund has 25 billion in assets , from more than 22 , 000 donors enough to persuade vanguard , schwab , t rowe price and many other financial institutions to start similar funds these new donoradvised funds are unquestionably a boon to the financial institutions that sponsor them , but there are lingering concerns about how they affect the nature of philanthropy and the future of the community foundations and other traditional charities that have long sponsored similar funds so far , the nation s nearly 600 community foundations have not suffered much from the competition in the economic boom of the last decade , all kinds of charities flourished but with the market s downturn , donations dipped late last year , and donors may be even more cautious this year at the same time , with more and more financial institutions marketing donoradvised funds through advertising campaigns , brokers and financial advisers , community foundations with much smaller marketing budgets wonder if they will have an increasingly difficult time attracting new donors this is a moment in time when the line between notforprofit and forprofit is becoming much more blurred , said charles halpern , scholar in residence at new york university law school some critics go so far as to question whether the financial institutions' donoradvised funds should be considered public charities i do n't think fidelity should have a tax exemption as a public charity because i do n't think they 're organized for a charitable purpose , said albert rodriguez , a los angeles lawyer who represents nonprofit organizations they 're organized for a commercial purpose basically , they operate to make a profit for fidelity , not to help the community donoradvised funds are not new for the last two decades , they have become a mainstay of hundreds of community foundations and jewish federations across the nation like fidelity , the community foundations offer an immediate tax deduction , collect a small percentage of the money for administration and give donors the chance to decide , over time , where to donate the money but unlike fidelity , they provide philanthropic guidance from a professional staff that stays in close touch with local needs profit or nonprofit , said sara engelhardt , president of the foundation center , donoradvised funds are an important , and growing , source of charitable dollars the good news is that with all the different choices , donoradvised funds are attracting a lot of new money for philanthropy , ms engelhardt said philanthropy used to be something people did mostly at the end of their life , often in their wills now more people think about it at younger ages , as soon as they begin making a lot of money there are absolutely real tradeoffs in choosing a financial institution or a community foundation community foundations have program officers who can advise donors on their philanthropy , and help them get involved but for those who know exactly where they want their money to go , the financial institutions' funds may be just right increasingly , families who are affluent but not wildly wealthy create donoradvised funds as a kind of scaleddown , lowoverhead family foundation , with none of the administrative headaches for example , michael clegg , a cleveland man who has a son with down syndrome , uses his 100 , 000 fund at the cleveland foundation , the nation s oldest community foundation , to help poor families with retarded children i knew what i wanted to do , but i could n't have done it on my own , mr clegg said so four years ago , i put money into the cleveland foundation and they assigned me a bright young lady as a program officer she went down and looked at the programs the county has , and got in touch with catholic charities and the jewish board of family services i talk to her several times a month , and she s getting better and better at filtering requests i'm very happy with how it s working out

hollywood , april 30 this is the time of year in television when writers like paul attanasio grow nervous the network says they like our show , they support our show , but it s meaningless if they do n't support us for another year , said mr attanasio , who created abc s gideon s crossing , a medical drama that has struggled to find an audience i'm really trying to fight for our show it s also the time of year when television executives like jordan levin , copresident for entertainment at the wb network , are not only watching new series pilots that may be ordered for next season but also receiving phone calls , email and even gift baskets from talent agents and producers imploring them to keep series on the air that may be vulnerable the pressure gets turned up , and everyone tries to leverage their relationship with you , mr levin said and there s so much misinformation being passed around town that people here could give lessons to the cia the new schedules , marked by more uncertainty than usual this year because of possible strikes by writers and actors , will be announced for potential advertisers in two weeks in new york television executives are now screening possible new shows and listening to the plans and pleas of writers of current series as they decide about the new schedules perhaps as many as a dozen series are on the bubble , or vulnerable to cancellation the shows are often first or secondyear series that have floundered in the ratings or proved disappointing to the networks but the size of an audience watching a series is only one factor in the decision making television executives say , for example , that nbc may have a hard time canceling the potentially vulnerable series third watch , about firefighters and emergency rescue workers , because its creator , john wells , has an entrenched relationship with the network as an executive producer of hits like er and the west wing similarly , abc executives are weighing the cancellation of once and again , the critically acclaimed series starring sela ward and billy campbell about two divorced people trying to forge a relationship that show s ratings have been modest but working to its advantage is abc s interest in maintaining a strong tie to the show s creators , edward zwick and marshall herskovitz , who also developed thirtysomething and are top television writerproducers the show is produced by touchstone television , a unit of the walt disney company , which owns abc and would benefit financially if once and again generates enough episodes to make it viable for syndication , where profits mushroom i love the show , said stuart bloomberg , cochairman of the abc television group and i would get such grief in my house if this show were n't on abc , i ca n't imagine it going anywhere else yet mr bloomberg said no decision had been made on once and again you ca n't look at any show in a vacuum , he said the shows on the bubble this year include cbs offerings with heavily female audiences like family law and kate brasher as well as nash bridges , that s life and the fugitive nbc s fighting fitzgeralds , three sisters and weber show the abc shows the job , two guys and a girl , norm , the geena davis show and what about joan and fox s lone gunmen on the smaller wb , angel , jack and jill , popular and roswell are among the shows that may not be renewed internal politics have always stamped renewal decisions cbs s everybody loves raymond , one of television s most successful comedies , floundered in its first season , 199697 , and was saved from cancellation not only because network executives found it appealing but also because david letterman s company , worldwide pants , was one of the producers by all accounts , cbs executives did not want to offend the network s latenight star if possible similarly , in 1997 nbc struggled mightily to placate the creators of the hugely successful sitcom friends by placing their new show , veronica s closet , in the choice time slot at 9 30 on thursday nights veronica s closet , with kirstie alley as a successful businesswoman , failed to stir audiences but lingered until 1999 largely because of the clout of its creators jeff zucker , the recently appointed president of nbc west coast , said ratings are only one factor in making these decisions there s also the question of whether the show has potential , where you think the show can go and how it stacks up to what we have sandy grushow , chairman of the fox tv entertainment group , said the phone calls often come from executives at studios who are producing multiple shows on a network they can certainly make life more painful , he said studios sometime use their contracted writers as bargaining chips and say , essentially , this is what we 're prepared to do for you with these writers , he said the network decision making is often intense as many as two dozen executives view each new pilot and discuss the bubble shows
forecasting what consumers , businesses and investors will do during normal times is as difficult as trying to put a pair of pants on an elephant , says john j mccabe comanager of the 58 million msb fund trying to do so after the events of sept 11 is utterly futile , he said , yet he and his comanager , mark f trautman , still make such forecasts , believing that it is sensible to buy stocks as long as they keep a truly longterm view in mind we will make some mistakes , but we do our homework , and time , patience and history are on our side , mr mccabe said from his office in midtown manhattan we plan to keep our companies for a long , long time in 2000 , the fund s turnover rate was a tiny 15 percent , versus more than 100 percent for the average domestic diversified stock fund , according to morningstar inc the fund returned 29 percent a year , on average , in the three years ended thursday , versus a 01 percent loss for all large blend funds and a 02 percent decline for the standard poor s 500stock index , morningstar said it lost 42 percent in the last 12 months , versus a 149 percent loss for its group and a 139 percent loss for the s p mr mccabe , 58 , is senior vice president of shay assets management , the fund s investment adviser , which is based in chicago and manages about 3 billion for seven mutual funds and for institutions mr trautman , 36 , is vice president of shay though the fund is open to all investors , it was originally intended as an investment portfolio for employees of new york state mutual savings banks , hence the name msb the managers describe themselves as grahamanddodd investors in 1934 , benjamin graham and david l dodd wrote security analysis , the classic text for value investors perhaps their most famous disciple is warren buffett , chief executive of berkshire hathaway , msb s biggest holding , at about 6 percent of assets berkshire hathaway owns general re , one of the largest global reinsurers their rates have gone up quite a bit , mr mccabe said , which should more than offset the payments that they will be required to make on account of sept 11 , which wo n't occur for a number of years because it will take time to evaluate and pay off the claims the managers pick the 25 to 30 stocks in the fund from among united states companies with market capitalization of at least 5 billion they look for companies that are dominant in their businesses , with consistent growth in longterm cash flow in established industries they also want solid management and significant free cash flow what is left after capital expenses because they look for sustainable competitive advantages , the managers typically avoid technology companies two exceptions are intel and microsoft , which dominate their markets , mr trautman said the managers prefer companies with ratios of debt to market capitalization below 50 percent , depending on the industry , as a cushion during periods of economic weakness they also want returns on capital of at least 15 percent over five years or more to value a company , they calculate an internal rate of return by forecasting the share price 10 years ahead , based on probable cash flow generally , they want that rate to average at least 12 to 15 percent a year on sept 21 , the fund bought shares of the state street corporation of boston , a provider of investment services and management , at an average of 3957 the price exceeded 50 in the summer but fell during the general market decline after sept 11 and is now at 5234 state street s business has grown consistently , mr trautman said , and he expects the company to generate an internal rate of return of 11 or 12 percent a year in the next 10 years the managers bought shares of procter gamble in july at an average of 6962 they now trade at 7746 the company s growth slowed early last year , mr mccabe said , as namebrand products in the paper products area , including bounty paper towels and charmin toilet tissue , were hurt by higher rawmaterial costs and increased competition the stock had traded at more than 100 in early 2000 we do n't mind buying a lowgrowth company if it is reflected in the stock price , he said he expects a longterm internal rate of return averaging 11 percent the slowdown in consumer spending also pushed down the stock of sherwinwilliams , the paint company in cleveland the fund bought shares in january at an average of 2466 they had traded as high as 26 in the spring of 2000 people are pricing the company as if it will have low samestore sales growth or none at all , mr trautman said when the economy rebounds , people will buy more paint he expects an 11 percent internal rate of return in the next 5 to 10 years the stock closed on friday at 2799

cambridge , mass nancy hopkins was a mere undergraduate at radcliffe when she was anointed by james d watson , who had won a nobel prize for discovering the double helix structure of dna she began her career as a member of his star constellation of biologists all of them men this being the late 1960 s , the push for women s rights was in full flower but dr hopkins shunned feminists she was a scientist i fled from them , she says they were the kiss of death professionally they were so angry , so unseemly at a summer incubator for talented young scientists in cold spring harbor , ny , barbara mcclintock , who would later win a nobel herself , kept trying to warn her that the boys' network would squeeze her out dr hopkins just smiled and thought , yes , but i'm different my best friends were these smart people men , she says now i could n't have been a scientist if i was n't accepted i thought , 'what are these women talking about \? ' thirty years later , nancy hopkins , a professor of biology at the massachusetts institute of technology , has become the emblem of the struggle by women for equal treatment in higher education when robert m berdahl , chancellor of the university of california at berkeley , greeted her recently he paraphrased abraham lincoln on meeting harriet beecher stowe here s the little lady who started the civil war two years ago , dr hopkins led a knot of women professors who documented pervasive bias at mit , prompting the university to admit it had unintentionally discriminated against female faculty members the admission from such a prominent institution and its moves to correct inequities have resonated widely there had been other reports at other universities , but this one looked beyond the numbers , to how women were treated dr hopkins , the reluctant feminist , seems an unlikely heroine but women saw themselves in her story professors who had considered themselves happy simply to have a job began to push their universities to examine inequities committees to document bias have sprung up on dozens of campuses across the country , from the university of pennsylvania and johns hopkins university to mit s rival , the california institute of technology , and the university of california at los angeles and berkeley discussions about hiring more women scientists , and more important , ensuring they are treated fairly , have come out of the shadows dr berdahl was one of nine presidents of the nation s top universities who gathered at mit in late january and pledged to improve the environment for women in sciences on the day dr hopkins was to speak at the harvard medical school on the issue , the dean announced a salary equity review of all its clinical professors at mit itself , the number of tenured women in dr hopkins s department , the school of science , has risen from 15 to 22 , the number of women overall from 22 to 32 the institute s four other schools are producing their own studies , with administrators promising to correct any inequities revealed the issue of gender was totally silent in the institute , says lotte bailyn , a professor of management at mit it was seen or feared to be counterproductive , which in many cases it was people were aware that these microinequities were happening and would share them with each other , but the discussion about this , particularly across the sexes , is new the timing is significant many of today s professors , hired as universities expanded in the 1960 s , are expected to retire in the next 5 to 10 years replacing them with women could change the demographics of departments where it is not unusual to find one woman scientist , or even none the opportunity wo n't come along again for another 25 to 30 years a new attitude among university presidents , however , does not always translate into a change in the culture dr hopkins and others have discovered how difficult that can be the university of southern california , for example , recently received a 20 million donation to help women in science , and wrote its initial proposal on how to spend it without consulting any women academia , and science in particular , is tuned to a more traditional world or at least one where most everyone has a wife research is isolating and demands long hours scientists tell how ii rabi , a nobel laureate physicist , remained in his lab at columbia university for days at a time , with mrs rabi leaving hot meals outside his door it s rooted in medieval society where monks were sitting around transcribing books , and in some ways , the culture has n't changed much , says cynthia friend , the only woman professor in harvard s chemistry department for a lot of people , the ideal life is one where they 'd never have to do anything but research the timehonored way of getting more out of a university more prestige , more money is to threaten to move a research project elsewhere but women are often less able to uproot themselves joan a steitz , a molecular biologist at yale , examined how many times members of the national academy of sciences had moved in their careers about 60 percent of women had never moved , compared to about 40 percent of men
bridgeport , conn , may 8 it is the baseball equivalent of the french foreign legion , with the twist that those here are hoping to be remembered , rather than forgotten fortyeight bombs last season , said ozzie canseco as he stood behind the batting cage yesterday afternoon in the ballpark at harbor yard here i hit 48 bombs , and led this league , and i'm still here nearby , his recently signed teammate on the newark bears and identical twin brother , jose canseco , said fortyeight bombs , and never got a callup it s a crying shame , is n't it \? and so the 36yearold brothers , united on a professional team for the first time since they played together briefly in oakland in 1990 , commiserate with each other as they aspire as do their teammates and opponents to depart the independent atlantic league , equivalent in many ways to class aaa ball , and return to either the major leagues , or major league organizations ozzie canseco has had only a quick taste of the majors in the early 1990 s his brother has been a bigtime star neither canseco can , they say , understand why they are where they are , but , nonetheless , here they are some people said i was damaged goods , whatever that means , said jose canseco , who was released by the anaheim angels near the end of spring training and then signed with newark in midapril i'm here to prove i'm not i'm still trying to fight the cloud over me beyond the leftfield wall on this cool , sunny spring afternoon , traffic crawls along interstate 95 in behind the centerfield and rightfield fences , a metronorth train rattles by in the context , the distant movement is almost wistful , as though the batting cage were a metaphor at this moment for their seeming bush league confinement also with the bears are 37yearold jim leyritz , the former yankee , with his odd , signature battwirling stance , and 37yearold lance johnson , the former yankee and met , who hits in quick , conventional fashion shagging balls in the outfield are pitchers jack armstrong , 35 , who last pitched in the major leagues in 1994 for texas , and jaime navarro , 32 , who once won 17 games for the brewers filling the rest of the bears' roster are mainly former minor league players , most around 30 years old , who hope to get another shot in some big league organization they are all aware that big league scouts often attend the games it was the home opener this afternoon for the bridgeport bluefish , and some 5 , 300 fans filled the banty ballpark when jose canseco was announced in his first atbat , the crowd cheered the opposition player , delighted , obviously , to see so famous a ballplayer in their midst canseco , the american league rookie of the year in 1986 and the american league s most valuable player in 1988 , has hit 446 home runs in the big leagues , 23rd on the career list he had 39 atbats in spring training for the angels before he was released the team said that his back and leg injuries contributed to their decision , along with the fact he had n't hit he was with the yankees for part of the 2000 season as a designated hitter and batted 243 with six homers , but was not included on the postseason roster i'm physically fit , said canseco , who , at a sculptured 6 feet 4 inches and 240 pounds , still looks as if he could snap a bat in half with his bare hands and i can run the 40 in 45 that s close to worldclass speed someone said i had lost bat speed \? that s ridiculous just test my bat speed , that s all hey , just two years ago i hit 46 home runs and drove in 107 runs that was with toronto , and , for the record , it was three season ago i 've played a few games now and i can see that the pitching is pretty good , definitely triple a level i 'll play here all season long if i have to , to prove i can still do it i'm faster and stronger and wiser about baseball than i 've ever been i 'll play for free if i have to he nearly is , if you look at his big league contracts his high was 5 million a year canseco said he signed with newark for 6 , 000 a month , while the league maximum for everyone else is 3 , 000 it was quite a pay cut , he said and it may be worth it to his team which has its home opener friday and the league he is a draw the bears , in their handsome stadium and in their second full season , drew about 3 , 500 a game last year the team owner , rick cerone , the former yankee and seton hall catcher born in newark , said he hoped to draw 6 , 000 a game this season , which is capacity and jose canseco , along with a performing arts center and a renovated riverfront in downtown newark , is a lure for cerone s 30 million investment \( with added funding from the city , county and state \) the handful of players from rosters of atlantic league teams who moved up to the major leagues include tim raines and ruben sierra but we sold 70 players back to major league organizations , said joe klein , a league executive , players who had previously been bypassed , released or injured leyritz had a tryout with the mets this spring , but was cut i thought i 'd get more of an opportunity , he said i know i have a reputation for producing down the stretch , and i imagine some teams in the pennant race would contact me in july so i wanted to be ready , and keep myself in shape it s tough to get up for games here there s none of the hoopla you 're used to in the major leagues but it s got to be done johnson was released last june by the yankees after a 14year major league career , the 37yearold outfielder was not invited to any big league spring training camps this spring the teams i talked with said they were going with youth , johnson said , and that i 'd make the youngsters insecure he shook his head in disbelief i'm here to keep in shape i feel i could play another five years he joined the bears yesterday was money a factor in his hope to return \?

washington , jan 19 for now , at least , the mood seems placidly subdued in the office of the attorney general after nearly eight years of trouble , strife and controversy at last , the spotlight has shifted away from janet reno one morning this week , ms reno seemed buoyant and jaunty in contrast to the grim visage she often displayed at congressional hearings as she contemplated her future outside the government and her return to her home in miami i'm going to sit on the front porch for a week and do nothing , she said in an interview , laughing then she is planning a 120mile kayak trip in the everglades after that , she said , i'm going to figure out what to do when i grow up later , ms reno said , she will drive crosscountry , part of the way by herself and part of the way with friends , in her newly purchased ford ranger pickup truck she had sometimes alluded to such a trip as a kind of fantasy escape in moments of crisis she will not keep her apartment in the capital she might teach or practice law at some point , she said and perhaps she will write a book about communitybuilding and issues with respect to violence , how we can continue to reduce violence in america after that , she said , she might write a memoir , but not the kind of scoresettling book that has become a nonfiction genre of the beltway if i write a memoir , she said , i would like it to have substance , like , 'here are some of the issues that you face as attorney general and here is what you can learn from them' her official portrait already hangs from the wall at the justice department s headquarters a simple painting in contrast to the elegantly finished oils of her predecessors in it , ms reno stares straight out of the canvas in her big glasses and plain black dress no frills yet she is not an uncomplicated figure , and her legacy is , like everything else about her tenure , a matter of intensely partisan debate her democratic admirers , including some within the justice department , regard her as a scrupulously fair decision maker her republican detractors have said she was the protector in chief of president clinton and vice president al gore for herself , ms reno would not comment directly on what she has called the legacy thing her reputation was under nearly continuous attack during the partisan battles between the republicancontrolled congress and the clinton administration , most often over whether highranking officials of the executive branch should be investigated by independent counsels the debates often wedged ms reno between the white house , where clinton aides complained that she referred too many cases to independent counsels , and her own fbi director , louis j freeh , who sided with republicans against her in those instances when he urged the appointment of outside prosecutors to investigate mr clinton and mr gore for possible campaign finance violations one of the things you learn , ms reno said , is that the dark hours are not the end of the world , but there is light at the end of the tunnel over all , her democratic allies applaud her for contributing to an era of decreasing crime , with violent crime rates going down 27 percent from 1993 to 2000 for combating terrorism , drugs and international organized crime and for enforcing civil rights laws in cases involving violence at abortion clinics and police misconduct during her tenure as attorney general , the justice department expanded in budget and manpower with a succession of crimefighting programs ms reno was keenly interested in youth crime and in violence against women she pursued a variety of proposals to crack down on gangs and tried to involve public and private organizations in crimeprevention programs but like her predecessors , ms reno is likely to be remembered not for the nutsandbolts work of the justice department , but for the way she steered the agency through the crises that created the defining moments of her stewardship the first crisis for ms reno was a shattering blow that came less than two months into her tenure , when a botched raid on the branch davidian compound near waco , tex , by the bureau of alcohol , tobacco and firearms left her to settle an armed standoff between religious cultists and the fbi with scant experience , she approved an fbi tear gas assault on the sect s compound on april 19 , 1993 , which ended in a conflagration and the deaths of about 80 people , among them many children she emerged as a national figure , and a hero to some she took responsibility but never the blame for the outcome , always placing the fault on the davidian leader , david koresh in the interview , ms reno , who once said she thought about the branch davidian incident every day of her life , said she had come to terms with the standoff she realized , she said , that she would never know what might have happened had she given the fbi s negotiations with mr koresh more time , which some experts later said might have led to a surrender

the woman nattering on about afghanistan has none of the shiny urgency of a tim russert or a cokie roberts she endlessly circles her subject and never seems to land on it her words are often ridiculously quaint , and so polysyllabic that they would never squeeze naturally into a sound bite yet this poetically vague creature , with her beautyparlor wave and sensible cardigan , is one talking head to whom attention should be paid the speaker of the ravishing monologue that is the first act of homebody kabul , the exciting if still unfulfilled new play from tony kushner , is admittedly less current on foreign affairs than any minor cnn anchor the principal reference for this middleaged englishwoman , played with heartmelting grace by linda emond in the production that opened last night at the new york theater workshop , is a 1965 guidebook her travels have been vicarious , literary , and she is speaking from her comfortably appointed home in london from the now distantseeming era of 1998 in the wake of sept 11 , the character called the homebody has become an example of what she finds irresistible in outdated books and theories the knowing what was known before the more that has since become known but as she considers 4 , 000 years of seismic carnage and change in afghanistan , she applies a point of view that feels as mutable and restless as history itself it s a perspective that opens and stimulates the imagination , focusing newly virgin eyes on a nation that now dominates american news by the time she has finished speaking , you are likely to feel the way she says guests should feel at the end of a good party surprising to themselves with a sense that the certainties with which they arrived are no longer very certain now how many playwrights working today make you feel this way \? homebody kabul , directed by declan donnellan , is mr kushner s first major work since the lightning bolt that is angels in america struck nearly a decade ago as a whole , this tale of cultural quest still has its own journey to make before reaching the level of angels \( which went through many years of gestation before reaching broadway \) but it definitely has the potential to get there the high points of this lumbering yet compelling evening testify that mr kushner can still deliver his sterling brand of goods a fusion of politics , poetry and boundless empathy transformed through language into passionate , juicy theater indeed , the first act , originally written more than two years ago for the british actress kika markham , is as fine as anything mr kushner has produced as ms emond s homebody tries to bring into visionary existence a fraught , devastated city that she has never seen , the play s form brings to mind the eccentricitydriven monologues of alan bennett the substance , however , is pure kushner , as a specifically realized character becomes a window onto vistas that approach the cosmic like angels , the homebody s monologue takes place at a bright intersection of public sweep and private reflection , of galloping history and individual destiny that heady balance of extremes is much less assured in the second and third acts , which shift from the homebody s fantasy of kabul to the real city ms emond s character has since disappeared there , and her husband , milton ceiling \( dylan baker \) , and her daughter , priscilla \( kelly hutchinson \) , have gone to find her almost as soon as the play segues into more conventional narrative , it bizarrely becomes less immediate and despite its considerable length \( approaching four hours \) , the production starts to feel underwritten and underdirected mr kushner has yet to crawl into the minds of his other characters as intimately as he has with the homebody , who emerges as a latterday answer to the matronly but mystical heroines of e m forster , like mrs wilcox of howard s end and mrs moore of a passage to india in fact , homebody kabul could be titled a passage to afghanistan mr kushner is , in a sense , a postcolonial heir to the liberal tradition of forster he , too , specializes in clashes of culture and class but while only connect was forster s famous shibboleth , mr kushner presents a world choking on its globewrapping connections the issue , as the homebody reflects , is not how vast but how crowded the world is collision has not meant melding , leading to a furious babel of pidgin cultures all must be touched , she chants all touch corrupts all must be corrupted the ultimate emblem of such corruption is the muchinvaded , muchimposedupon country of afghanistan , which she describes from the dawn of history to the age of the taliban , and somehow manages to link to her own use of antidepressants in defining a distant , analysisdefying land , she boldly wonders how it defines her ms emond s blue eyes , which look both ineffably sad and ecstatic , engage you so directly that you somehow wind up sharing her gaze when the homebody takes 10 afghanstyle hats , which she has purchased for a party , out of a paper bag , ms emond quietly turns the moment into the evening s most stirringly theatrical scene
from every corner of madison square garden signs dangled from the rafters and unfurled from the hands of children and oldtimers there was none of the anticipated mixed reaction in the messages each one lamented his departure or begged for his return and just behind the sonics' bench , donna fernandes of cranford , nj , spoke for each of them fernandes , adorned in a green supersonics ewing jersey with his no 33 as well as a worn , blue ewing baseball cap and gripping a new jersey license plate reading ewing33 , stood just a step from ewing and bellowed her greeting loud enough to be heard from the upper reaches of the garden i come to knicks games during the year , but i'm rooting against them tonight , she said i'm a ewing fan i have a knicks jersey with ewing on it , but i'm wearing the seattle shirt to tell the knicks , how dare they trade the warrior \? if ewing endured a lovehate relationship with knick fans during his 15 seasons in new york , all of the hard feelings had diminished by the time he returned last night for the first time since being traded last sept 20 if there were any knick fans still railing against ewing , they were far outnumbered by his supporters the garden echoed with applause when he emerged from the tunnel and stepped onto the court the cheers grew louder with each of his trips through the layup line , and then culminated in an ovation that lasted three minutes after the knicks showed a video tribute to their longtime center from a luxury box , not far from the retired jerseys above the crowd , hung a sign that read , ewing 33 , might as well hang it from the rafters tonight on the day that ewing was sent to seattle in a fourteam trade , madison square garden president dave checketts spoke of his desire to add ewing s jersey to the already crowded lineup of retired numbers but for tonight , the knicks left the sentiment to the fans spike lee , a fixture in the front row , donned an autographed , gameworn ewing jersey for the occasion , a size 56 shirt you knew he 'd been thinking about this game for a long time , and he was going to show up , lee said after ewing s introduction i think it was great the way the fans reacted i think patrick was touched by it as for his ewing jersey , lee said i'm just wearing it tonight i'm getting it framed after this i 've been waiting for this day i guess when the trade was announced , everybody , not just me , rushed to the schedule to see when the first time was that he would come back it s a great day new york city is a very rough town , but new yorkers are not that rough that they wo n't embrace him outside the arena , the garden s message read , welcome back patrick ewing fans roamed around an hour before the doors opened , commiserating with one another over ewing s absence and wandering into the gerry cosby sons sporting goods store lee added it s strange i spoke to him after the trade and you do n't know what to say i know it s not the same thing , but what do you say to someone who s just lost a relative \? i'm not saying it s the same , but it s sort of like that he s been here 15 years , and he s no longer here and the way it happened was kind of ugly , too coming out in that green uniform is ugly , too
hurley , ny , feb 7 after eight months of quietly studying the sprawling archdiocese of new york , archbishop edward m egan announced his first major costcutting measure today , a decision to close a financially failing high school with a dwindling student population here in ulster county the school , john a coleman catholic high school , just outside kingston , is to close at the end of this academic year and will be the first school shut by the archdiocese since 1994 the decision comes two weeks before archbishop egan , who was installed in june , is to be elevated to cardinal by pope john paul ii school officials and community leaders said today they had been told that the closing of coleman high was the first step in a wider effort to reorganize schools and parishes and archdiocesan officials suggested today that more changes lay ahead everything is being looked at in the diocese , said joseph zwilling , the archdiocesan spokesman the archbishop has been doing this for the better part of seven and a half months now , he said and you know there is the possibility that there might be other changes , reconfigurations , reorganizations coming , but there has been no decision made at this point about anything specific beyond what we announced today he added , none of this can be looked at just as one piece archbishop egan came to the new york archdiocese from bridgeport , conn , where as bishop he had a reputation as a fiscal manager who cut spending and reduced debt by carefully consolidating schools and parishes that image was in marked contrast to his predecessor , cardinal john j o'connor , who was known for resisting such consolidation and for closing schools only with great reluctance that reluctance could hardly be better illustrated than by coleman high school , which since 1996 has been kept alive by subsidies from the archdiocese totaling more than 25 million the subsidy for next year alone was projected at more than 800 , 000 the student population has dwindled from a high of 590 in 1974 to 188 this year and was expected to drop further while the school s budget deficits have been under scrutiny for quite some time , the decision to shut the school was made quickly within the last week , and the news shocked school officials and the community just two weeks ago , the school ordered uniforms for a new dress code in september the school s principal , ellenjane gonyea , said today that the first word she received about the closing came on monday , while students and teachers were trapped at home by the big snowstorm until her meeting monday with brother thomas schady , the associate superintendent of schools for the archdiocese , all signs had been pointing toward at least another year of operation , mrs gonyea said in december , the archdiocesan vicar for education , thomas bergin , had approved increasing annual tuition to 3 , 950 from 3 , 700 and this saturday , the school had planned to give an entrance exam to prospective students still , given the school s financial history , mrs gonyea conceded that the decision was hardly unforeseeable i'm a rational person and i do see the balance sheet she said so one might wonder how long that subsidy might go on on tuesday , she informed the faculty and sent a letter to parents today , she met with the students in three teary assemblies the junior class is devastated , as you can imagine , she said , recounting some of their concerns how will i play on the basketball team coming in as a senior \? where are my college recommendations going to come from \? minutes earlier , a junior , helena costakis , 17 , had been standing outside mrs gonyea s office crying and hugging a friend i want to graduate with my own class , she said , rejecting the suggestion that she would be with her friends somewhere else next year i wo n't go to another high school this is my high school coleman is the only catholic high school in ulster county the nearest catholic high schools are in albany and poughkeepsie coleman high school , which opened in 1967 , is one of 12 high schools owned and operated directly by the archdiocese other schools are attached to parishes or operated by religious orders and cannot be closed unilaterally the archdiocese has 293 schools it comprises seven upstate counties and the boroughs of the bronx , manhattan and staten island its annual budget is more than 527 million lisa hopson , the school s music teacher , seemed shaken as she left the building with her daughter , natalie , who is a junior my eyes are so red , i have n't been able to see after two days of crying , ms hopson said among those who said they were upset by the abrupt announcement was mayor t r gallo of kingston , who graduated from the school in 1978 it s a tremendous loss for the city , he said it s my understanding that the cardinal had indicated that there were many hard decisions that were going to have to be made it s unfortunate that the first one has to be in ulster county the president of the kingston city council , jim sottile , is also a graduate , he said you have got the top two elected officials in the county both are graduates of john a coleman mr gallo said he had called the archdiocese today after learning of the decision i knew that the enrollment was down , but i had no idea that a decision to close was imminent , he said i am a little disheartened that the archdiocese did n't reach out to some of the local officials to see if we could help mrs gonyea , the principal , said she knew archbishop egan had a reputation for favoring centralization of parishes and schools i am aware that in his background there is a lot of emphasis on that , she said in her letter to parents , mrs gonyea explained that the average for a single student s education was 7 , 436 a year , more than twice what is charged for tuition in bridgeport , critics had said archbishop egan was autocratic and had treated finances as if they were more important than parishioners and their feelings but in hurley , a small town of old stone buildings dating from the revolution , the archdiocese has shown great compassion in handling the closing , mrs gonyea said counselors were provided for students , and teachers were promised assistance in finding new jobs such praise will certainly be appreciated by archbishop egan , who faces constant comparison to cardinal o'connor , a prelate known for an especially common touch with parishioners in his first 10 years in new york , cardinal o'connor presided over about 30 school closings , mr zwilling said but in his later years , cardinal o'connor resisted consolidating schools or parishes , seeing them as anchors of communities , especially in places with shrinking catholic populations there were some that he reluctantly allowed to close , but he did n't close them down , a former archdiocesan official said that left the expectation that archbishop egan would have a lot to do o'connor left him with a big job , the official said photo three juniors , from left , julia dvorak , helena costakis and ryan trepanier , after learning of the school closing \( suzanne dechillo the new york times \) map of new york highlighting hurley the school in hurley , in ulster county , has 188 students this year \( pg b7 \)
the peppered moth by margaret drabble 369 pp new york harcourt 25 bad mothers , just as surely as absentee fathers or feuding siblings , can make for good fiction they often make for compelling autobiography as well , but what is the reader to do when an author ca n't decide whether a particular bad mother is the stuff of a novel , a memoir or some creative genre inbetween \? the fact of the matter is that nowadays most writers do n't bother much with the increasingly fine \( some might say vanished \) line between fiction and nonfiction so there is something touchingly ingenuous about the tug of war that pulls margaret drabble every which way in her new novel , the peppered moth , the central character of which is based on her mother , who died in 1982 the conflict exerts discernible pressure on drabble s literary control , and raises still pertinent questions about the limits of creative license on one side are the imperious dictates of artistic intention on the other are the tempering considerations of responsibility to the truth and of real people s very real feelings set in the early 1900 s in breaseborough , a town in the southern yorkshire coal belt , and spanning three generations of women up until the present , the novel attempts to extract cautionary meaning from the strange and uneventful and disappointed life of its antiheroine pretty bessie bawtry is an electrician s daughter , born into the lower end of the latevictorian middle class , where meals consist of boiled meat , children are taught to keep to their mean place , and the lace curtains on the frontparlor windows are sooty from the quarries but bessie is of a finer breed her precocious intelligence propels her all the way to cambridge on a scholarship initially , it seems as if she will mutate into a new and more mobile species , poised for escape something had set her apart , had implanted in her needs and desires beyond her station , beyond her class bessie settles easily into the university s atmosphere of cloistered commitment , delighted to be treated as the fastidious and rare person she has always known herself to be but then , just as she is on the brink of breaking away from her grimy hometown and unaspiring family , something goes drastically awry bessie s monomaniacal drive begins to falter in the face of the inbred english snobbism of the university , where almost all her fellow students come from better homes and more illustrious schools like one of those henry james characters who seem primed for a sparkling destiny only to be ground down in the jaws of an unrelenting fate , she returns to teach in her old school soon after , fearing spinsterhood , she marries joe barron , a classmate who comes from a prominent family in a neighboring and unimportant town beset by various anxieties and phobias , bessie withdraws into the narrowest of existences , taking scant joy in her two children and none at all in her goodhearted barrister husband bessie bawtry is something of a domestic monster , as unappeasable as she is unhappy alternately depressed and angry , she rages against the dying of the spotlight that was once so clearly meant for her drabble describes her with a kind of rapt horror , mesmerized by her egotism , her hypochondria , her adult pretensions and her grandiose girlhood fantasies stuck as she is between the inherited defects of her character and the limitations of her early environment , bessie becomes an unsettling study in the bleakest sort of darwinism the survival of the grimmest bessie may be an evolutionary mistake , drabble speculates heartlessly only three pages into the novel natural selection may deselect her time will tell we are used to thinking of love , even at its most ambivalent , as the motivating force behind creative work , but hatred , which has an ambivalence all its own , has probably fueled almost as much artistic endeavor drabble s intensely conflicted feelings about her own mother which , on the evidence of this book , lean more toward hostility than affection ripple throughout the peppered moth they contribute to a palpable sense of unease about the inventive uses to which she puts documentary material , including family correspondence and local newspapers just as we are trotting along , secure in the writer s hands on the reins , drabble is capable of rearing back from the narrative if this story were merely a fiction , she points out , it would be possible to fill in these gaps with plausible incidents , but the narrator here has to admit to considerable difficulty , indeed to failure a shadow of uncertainty falls across the novel , right up through the curious afterword one of the oddest authorial intrusions ever in which drabble finally comes from behind the curtain and declares this is a novel about my mother kathleen marie bloor i think about my mother a great deal , uncomfortably maybe i should have tried to write a factual memoir of her life , but i have written this instead

london no british dramatist polarizes his countrymen as much as edward bond one view is that he is an unholy terror unrelenting in his doctrinaire socialism , harsh in his dealings with people and disconcertingly fond of ultraviolent effects in his plays the other is that he is a secular saint a man of unflinching integrity in a world of shoddy compromise , personally kind and generous and uniquely sensitive to the sort of vulnerability , frustration and pain evoked in his saved that still controversial play is getting its first major new york production since alan schneider s in 1970 presented at the american place theater by theater for a new audience , it opens next sunday , directed by robert woodruff it was understandable , then , that i felt wary when i went to the house that mr bond , 66 , shares with his vienneseborn wife part19thcentury , partmodern cottage , it is hidden from the road by trees in the countryside near cambridge as it turned out , mr bond polarized me contradiction prevailed nobody could have been more courteous , especially to a critic who has been less than warm to some of his work but none would have spoken with quite such ferocious disdain of the national theater , the royal shakespeare company and the rest of the mainstream british theater in france and germany edward bond is regarded as a major european dramatist in his own country he is a prophet without honor , a willful outsider , or maybe both at once saved , too , has had a topsyturvy history when it opened in 1965 , it divided the reviewers as no play had since ibsen s ghosts some noticed nothing but the horrific event at its center , the stoning to death by young drifters of a baby in its carriage but while they dismissed the piece as revolting and distasteful , penelope gilliatt , then the observer s theater critic , saw it as a brave and brilliant study of the bottom end of human possibility the late ms gilliatt s reward was to be anonymously sent tornup programs and a newspaper photo of her own child with her head cut off and her body daubed in red ink as she wrote of the saved controversy , the objectors deny , with frightening violence , that such violence exists yet her view triumphed saved had been given 45 professional productions in 12 countries by the end of the 1960 s it continues to be revived all over the world it has influenced young playwrights like the late sarah kane , and it came near the top of the national s recently published list of significant 20thcentury plays a masterpiece , wrote the critic and scholar martin esslin in 1985 the edward bond you see on some of his book jackets , with his thinrimmed spectacles and severe expression , looks as if he might be presiding over a revolutionary tribunal but in person he is not at all intimidating although his round face sometimes tensed as he spoke of difficult or painful matters over coffee in his bookcrammed study , there was humor in his voice and a wry disbelief as he contemplated some of his more absurd experiences , especially involving saved as mr bond recalled events , saved gathered dust for two years in a royal court drawer then the theater s artistic director , william gaskill , who had been impressed by a sunday night performance of the aspiring dramatist s first play , the pope s wedding , read the piece and decided nothing would stop him from staging it but in 1965 every stage work had to be sanctioned by a censor with a strangely antiquated name and the lord chamberlain demanded cuts and changes galore the script came back from his office with blue lines all over it , mr bond remembered i said in my head , 'it s him or me' the royal court agreed with mr bond s refusal to alter a single line that the lord chamberlain considered too violent , sexually suggestive or indecorous so the theater temporarily became a membersonly club to avoid prosecution for publicly staging an unlicensed play but that did n't end the trouble there were , mr bond remembers , fistfights in the auditorium , which spilled into the bar moreover , plainclothes police infiltrated performances in hopes of proving that the royal court s club status was a fiction the result was a prosecution that drifted on until mid1966 even evidence from laurence olivier , who said the play bravely held up the mirror to british society , did n't prevent the theater s top management from being convicted and given a conditional discharge , meaning that they would be in serious trouble if they erred again that was ironic , as theater censorship was abolished in 1968 , which allowed the royal court to revive saved in tandem with a new bond play that the lord chamberlain had tried to ban completely early morning , a period satire in which queen victoria has a lesbian affair with florence nightingale and strangles her husband , albert , with her garter nothing had prepared mr bond for all this his father was a laborer who lived in the east anglian countryside north of cambridge the dramatist returned to his family roots when he bought his current home but was driven by the depression to seek work in a north london that struck the young edward as a brick desert he left school at 15 without having taken any exams
the idea of protecting people in public and commercial buildings against a bioterror attack may conjure up 1950 sera pictures of students crouching under desks but engineers and terrorism experts say advances in building design over the last 5 to 10 years have left the nation surprisingly well prepared to reduce the danger from insidious threats like airborne anthrax spores those advances , many involving indoor air quality and energy efficiency , have grown out of mundane needs like filtering small particles from the air to prevent sickbuilding syndrome or reducing the amount of outdoor air that leaks inside and raises utility costs much more powerful technology is just beginning to reach the marketplace from military research programs that have focused on countering biological and chemical attacks the way we design our buildings now , they 're well built they 're tight , said barney burroughs , chairman of the committee that sets standards for ventilation filters at the american society for heating , refrigerating and airconditioning engineers , or ashrae commercial buildings have fine protection devices in them , because we are tempering the air mr burroughs and others said , however , that the terror attacks could push building owners who have lagged behind those trends to meet or exceed recommended standards that do not generally have the force of law though none of these changes can eliminate the threat entirely , more advanced and expensive technologies can push the level of protection much higher we have a lot of information available that can assist any firms that would like to do this , said william blewett , a mechanical engineer working on protection against chemical and biological agents at the army s edgewood chemical biological center at aberdeen proving ground in maryland discussing the close connection between controlling indoor air quality and defending against bioterror is something of a moral catch22 for us , said jon shaw , a spokesman in the syracuse office of carrier , the heating and cooling systems manufacturer while there are ways that you can filter and catch small particles , to discuss how to do so publicly also creates an environment where you teach people how they can get around it , mr shaw said but he said carrier already marketed ventilation systems that maintained positive pressure , or a slightly higher air pressure inside buildings than outside positive pressure can keep polluted air , or a cloud of a biological agent released outside , from entering a building without passing through its intake filters the company also markets things like highefficiency particulate air , or hepa , filters , that are continually irradiated by ultraviolet light hepa filters capture more than 9997 percent of particles larger than half a micron , and ultraviolet light kills common bacteria , molds and fungi , as well as anthrax spores a human hair is about 100 microns across mr burroughs , who is also president of building wellness consultancy inc , said that even less expensive filters that met the latest ashrae standards captured up to 95 percent of particles of five microns he said many buildings still had older systems that captured less than 20 percent of those particles , adding that in the last decade there has been a general upgrade across the board efficient filters cannot prevent all exposure to a biological attack from within a building , as when people opened envelopes filled with fine powder contaminated with anthrax but filters can stop the powder from spreading through the rest of the building through the ventilation system measures that focus on thwarting biological and chemical attacks range from commonsensical and cheap to advanced and astronomically expensive , said mr blewett of the edgewood chemical biological center he said , for example , that merely placing air intakes in new buildings high above the ground , in a protected area , went a long way toward protecting against one of the most feared types of attack , in which an agent is poured directly into the ventilation system the center s biological and chemical defense program has also outfitted about 200 buildings in the united states and overseas with elaborate ventilation and filtering systems to give nearly absolute protection against accidents or attacks some of those buildings are schools , hospitals and jails near chemical depots , where accidental releases are a concern , and many are military installations that could be the target of attacks , mr blewett said even so , he added , the users of those sophisticated systems faced some familiar problems in some overseas military installations , he said , they do n't even do the routine maintenance , changing the dust filters though many of those systems are very expensive , they are beginning to drop in cost and make their way into the commercial world , said arthur soma , product manager at barnebey sutcliffe , a company in columbus , ohio , that builds equipment for the program but mr soma said the specialized nature of many of his projects , like a system at a county jail next to a chemical depot in newport , ind , made it hard to estimate costs in the marketplace the jail project , he said , not only required special filters but also bars over the ventilation ducts
i traveled to washington last month for an informal news conference that had been called by senator pete domenici , whose daughter suffers from a severe mental illness , and senator paul wellstone , whose brother is mentally ill i went not as a reporter but as a depressive who is disappointed that congress continues to allow mental illness to be treated as a stepchild if you 've got a physical illness , diabetes or a broken arm , measles or a heart problem , then you 're legitimately sick in the eyes of the health care establishment the insurance companies and the health maintenance organizations but if you suffer from clinical depression or schizophrenia or any one of half a dozen other mental problems , you 're stigmatized you 're not really sick enough to merit the same kind of health care it s unfair and it s wrong physical illness can put you out of action for a while it s often painful and debilitating but some mental illnesses are more painful and more debilitating they can last longer and be more difficult and expensive to treat and that s what is at the root of the difference , the disparity with which insurers and hmo s treat mental illness compared to physical illness it s the usual suspect money i make a very comfortable living , but i would n't be able to if i had n't been able to afford the psychiatric care i needed when i first encountered a clinical depression about 20 years ago it took months of psychiatric treatment plus expensive medications to lift me from my downward spiral and put me back to work i still take the medication and so when i hear tales about how difficult and dispiriting it is for many families to keep a depressive breadwinner on the job and supporting his kids , because he just ca n't afford the treatment that someone with a damaged liver or a damaged heart can get , i find it infuriating the medical community will tell you that access to mental health care often reduces medical claims for physical illness and helps reduce absenteeism there s a real heartbreaker here , too according to the surgeon general s mental health report of 1999 , the third most common cause of death among america s youth is suicide could more such tragedies be averted if parents could afford psychiatric help for their children \? a bill now before congress would eliminate the disparity between health coverage for physical and mental illnesses it would require group health plans sponsored by firms with more than 50 employees to cover treatment for mental illness in the same way they cover treatment for other illnesses by setting equal copayments for doctor visits , for example the senate has passed it , but a few house leaders do n't like it it s now in conference this issue is not new in 1996 , congress passed a law that required rough parity , but it was riddled with loopholes ever since , senators domenici and wellstone , among others , have been working for a measure that would provide true parity it is a worthy goal , one realized by none other than the federal government itself since jan 1 , it has provided its three million employees including members of congress and their staffs with equal coverage for both physical and mental illnesses do n't the rest of us deserve the same \?
