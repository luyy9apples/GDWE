hunger or insanity could lead someone to eat his way around the intersection of east 149th street and southern boulevard in the south bronx from the bakery filled with sugary cakes , past the latin restaurant selling curled slabs of fried pork skin , past the dunkin' donuts and on to popeyes chicken and biscuits just in case , a pizzeria and a white castle beckon from nearby blocks , too towering over this strip is a giant mural for what by default is the only light thing around coors light it is no accident that one of the best views of this gastronomic gantlet is from the steps of the very place where it has led more than a few unfortunates the ortiz funeral home i stopped trying to find anything because there s nothing healthy to eat around here , lamented a woman who would give her name only as miss david and who works at public school 25 i was once buying coffee at the dunkin' donuts , and i saw a chubby young guy ordering a bacon something for breakfast two of them that scared me the devastating results of poor diet , no exercise and lots of stress are increasingly scaring health advocates in poor communities across the city diabetes is now the city s fourth leading cause of death in neighborhoods where homicide or aids were the leading killers among young men and women a decade ago , heart disease and obesity are claiming ever more lives no wonder recent federal dietary guidelines recommend decreasing calories and increasing exercise it is a truly bizarre situation where food itself makes you sick , said chris norwood , the executive director of health people , a community health education group whose office is just off east 149th street throughout history , getting enough food to stay well was usually the challenge then again , most of this stuff is not food although ms norwood first came to the area in the 1980 s to work with people who had hiv and aids , she soon found herself vexed by how asthma , diabetes and heart disease were wreaking havoc on residents she now thinks psychological stress is as much to blame as poor diet or smoking a third of the men around here are in jail or on parole , and 50 percent of the rest do n't have jobs , she said women are raising children alone we have a collapse of normal social support in the communal body , so that people become depressed in a way that they no longer understand that good health is possible but while , in the case of aids , a sense of crisis led to funding for prevention and community education , ms norwood says that not enough resources have been devoted to fighting obesity , diabetes or smoking dr hal strelnick , a professor of family and social medicine at the albert einstein college of medicine , says he has seen more and more young people suffering from a combination of chronic conditions in some cases , weight , cholesterol or blood pressure do not even have to be above critical levels to put people at risk for serious illness if all three measures are borderline , the result , known as metabolic syndrome , can be just as dangerous most alarming , dr strelnick said , is that more teenagers are developing type 2 diabetes , a condition that affects the obese while proper diet would help , local food stores usually stock what is cheap and popular , not what is best even more maddening , the most immediate health effect of the nearby hunts point produce market on residents is a bad one there is a higher rate of asthma because of the volume of truck traffic to the market , dr strelnick said everybody else s food comes through hunts point the great irony is there is all this wonderful food down the road but none of it ends up on the local shelves this is not hyperbole although patricia jackson lives in mott haven , she shops for vegetables in manhattan as a diabetic , she watches her diet , she says , even if she recently splurged with some cake we had this tenant association party , and there is this lady , miss sarah , who is from macon , ga , ms jackson said this lady can cook !

las vegas , march 10 jack roush figures he is due he put 18 years of time , sweat and money into racing in nascar s elite cup series he stood resolute for years even when he thought nascar was out to get him waiting for the day he would finally be on top , roush even survived an airplane crash today he is not only no 1 , but he is also nos 3 , 4 and 5 that is how the nextel cup points race stacks up for roush racing , with kurt busch leading , just ahead of jimmie johnson of hendrick motorsports , heading into the uawdaimlerchrysler 400 on sunday at las vegas motor speedway mark martin , a longtime roush driver , is third , with his teammates carl edwards and greg biffle fourth and fifth through two races this season all with no apologies to the competition that roush seems to be leaving behind in the nextel cup i had multiple opportunities to win championships and i came up dry , roush said in a telephone interview wednesday this is a business that ebbs and flows it needs to be my time few would doubt it is roush racing s time in the nextel cup roush has captured the last two points titles , with matt kenseth winning in 2003 and busch winning last year roush has one victory in two races so far this season biffle won on feb 27 in fontana , calif and heads into the annual las vegas stop having won five of seven races there since 1998 kenseth is the twotime defending champion at las vegas all my teammates right now are running really good , kenseth said in a conference call with reporters this week all except kenseth a blown engine in the daytona 500 on feb 20 and a flat tire at fontana cost him kenseth is 36th in the points race , but it is too early for concern he still has 24 races to make the 10car field for the 10race playoff at the end of the season in fact , there is a chance roush could have four or five drivers in that field it s a possibility , he said i 'd say it s not an expectation , but it certainly is our goal to do that roush had three drivers in the chase last year busch , the eventual champion , and kenseth and martin the numbers and the odds were in his favor no other team had as many as three drivers in the chase they 've had good cars the last couple seasons , the driver kevin harvick said in a conference call with reporters when they get to running good , it looks like they 're dominating they 're definitely strong right now they wo n't win every week i promise you that but they are in the hunt every week , and that is crucial to making the chase busch finished second in the daytona 500 , behind jeff gordon , and followed that with a thirdplace showing at fontana to take the early points lead at fontana , every roush driver led for a lap , and four finished in the top 10 it just says how strong our organization is , biffle said after winning at fontana i think it speaks for what is to come this season with our cars but this is hardly a oneteam race johnson and gordon are as strong as ever with hendrick motorsports tony stewart is in contention most weeks for joe gibbs racing , which won two titles in three years from 2000 to 2002 and there is always dale earnhardt jr of dale earnhardt inc nascar officials say they are not concerned that the competitive balance in the nextel cup has tipped roush s way is roush out of sync with everybody else when it comes to competitive balance \? the nascar president , mike helton , said tuesday in a telephone interview we do n't feel like that we have gone through cycles where dynasties have been very strong that s a cycle in our sport that we very well may be in with jack roush right now roush takes none of it for granted in his first 16 years , he finished a frustrating second four times with martin a 46point penalty issued to martin by nascar late in the 1990 season left him 26 points behind the champion , dale earnhardt roush still questions nascar on that call yet roush is lucky to see any of his team s success he nearly died in a plane crash in 2002 he was pulled from the wreckage and resuscitated after a plane he was flying crashed into a lake in alabama a year later , roush had his first title with kenseth he is a little bit different than he was before the accident , kenseth said here thursday he s a little bit softer i think he always will be maybe so , but he is no less determined to make the most of his turn in the spotlight roush has waited long enough
among the many questions still swirling around the collapse of the bayou group , a 300 million hedge fund , is why did so many wall street professionals and institutions believe bayou s founder , samuel israel iii , was a successful , wellconnected money manager with an honorable reputation \? clues are contained in a lawsuit filed this month in new york state supreme court by someone who lent mr israel 3 million and was not repaid professionally , mr israel used his connections and his family name to attract dozens of investors \( including martin payson , the former vice chairman of time warner \) , as well as recommendations from many consultants who directed money to bayou funds personally , mr israel apparently used that reputation to secure a 3 million loan from a wall street executive as he scrambled to keep together his crumbling empire the complaint reveals a string of email messages from mr israel offering a variety of explanations for why he could not repay the personal loan on june 14 , mr israel borrowed 3 million from steven starker , an employee at baypoint trading and a former goldman sachs managing director according to court documents , mr israel told mr starker in a letter that he was worth in excess of 18 million and that he intended to use the loan to resolve temporary cash flow for my divorce settlement mr israel has been involved in divorce proceedings for the last two years the exwife wants the settlement on thursday , mr israel wrote in the june 15 letter the source of repayment , mr israel indicated , would be his capital account at bayou the money would be repaid in a month , according to the contract by july 23 , mr israel was sending apologetic email messages trying to explain his default i hope my credibility has not suffered too much as i am sure it has , but you did me a major favor and i would never screw you nor anyone else for that matter , he wrote to mr starker it is unclear why mr starker lent the money to mr israel the june 15 letter from mr israel suggests that mr starker was hoping to attract some of bayou s future trading in addition , we have promised you to trade through your company for our normal course of business , a promise that would have been lucrative had mr israel been engaged in the kind of fastpaced trading he told investors he did the loan , due july 15 , was never paid a court has issued an order that mr israel pay the funds , but that is dependent on whether mr israel has any assets mr starker and his lawyer , joseph f fields of the law firm of dickstein shapiro morin oshinsky , declined to comment lawrence bader , who represents mr israel , did not return calls seeking comment according to the complaint , no money was ever given to mr israel s wife , janice a lawyer representing her did not return calls seeking comment kroll associates , which was hired by mr starker to investigate mr israel s assets , found none mr israel told mr starker he was placing funds in offshore accounts to prevent his wife and other creditors from discovering or recovering them , according to the complaint mr israel sent various email messages to mr starker with explanations for why he could not repay the loan on july 18 , he said the money would be delayed because of a slight delay in my divorce there is no need for concern this would help me dramatically and you will be paid in full on thursday , the email message read days later mr starker received another email message i have never borrowed money in my life , and i guess this is why i do not enjoy being in this position , mr israel wrote soon after that correspondence mr israel sent another email message indicating he was expecting a 5 million loan from wachovia , partly on the basis that he had substantial holdings in private companies , including gryphon networks , adam aircraft and acopia i am on top of it 100 he wrote july 29 representatives from the three companies did not return calls on aug 18 , mr israel told mr starker that daniel marino , the chief financial officer of bayou , had committed suicide because of the financial scandal at bayou a friend of mr starker later discovered that mr marino was alive but in hiding , the court documents indicate mr starker s affidavit says that from july 15 to aug 15 , mr israel listed the following reasons for not paying the assets terry goddard , a district attorney in arizona , had frozen the assets mr marino had made unauthorized private equity investments with his money , causing his assets to be frozen janice israel had refiled for divorce and frozen his assets and wachovia bank had frozen his assets in fact , mr goddard , the arizona attorney general , had frozen 100 million of mr israel s money as part of another fraud investigation it was mr israel s claim for that money that led to the public disclosure of the unraveling of bayou
the academy awards are famously vulgar , dependably boring , grievously misguided and widely deemed by both casual viewers and critics a monumental waste of time but if you pay close enough attention to the oscars , which will be broadcast this evening and , in particular , to the nominations you can learn a lot about the industry the show reveals what the industry is thinking in the moment and lets us catch sight of the future the event may be the ultimate in selfaffirmation we like ourselves , we really , really like ourselves ! but it reflects a larger conversation this otherwise publicitydriven industry does not always share with the rest of us the academy of motion picture arts and sciences gets plenty wrong , but it gets plenty right , and has since the first awards ceremony , in 1929 that event , a lowkey dinner held in a hotel , is principally noteworthy because the academy presented what were effectively two awards for best film of the year outstanding picture and unique and artistic picture the first went to william a wellman s wings , a smash about fighter pilots in love the second went to fw murnau s masterpiece , sunrise , a moody romance that was the most expensive silent film ever made by the fox studio the studio s chief believed murnau was a genius but genius does not necessarily bring in paying crowds , and the film did not make back its costs the next year the academy designated just one award for the favored film of the year outstanding picture you can read the history of the academy awards and by extension american movies as a continuation of that initial split in the award for best film part of what makes the oscars such an addictive spectacle is that there are few times when the struggle between cinematic art and industry , vision and profit plays out as openly as during the awards show , with its veneer of high seriousness and molten core of greed the academy awards make new careers , jumpstart flagging ones and bump blist players to the a list it is an unabashedly exclusive club for those who do make it in , the academy can seem wonderfully welcoming for those who do not , it can be a long , cold wait outside those velvet ropes consider the academy s honorary awards , which i always thought of as the i 've got good news , i 've got bad news award the good news is you just won an oscar the bad news is you are about to croak these awards used to be given to innovators like the young walt disney and an occasional respected veteran by the late 1950 s , however , with the classic studio system in collapse , the academy was mostly honoring older members alas , this gambit took on a macabre cast when those honorees started dying more than a third were gone five years after accepting their statuettes in an attempt to pay tribute to those who built hollywood , the academy transformed the awards into memorials , as much for the industry as for the honorees the movie industry is in robust health now and , fortunately , so are the recent winners of the honorary awards since the mid1990 s , only two have passed on , which is why i am not concerned about this year s recipient , the director sidney lumet the honorary awards now essentially function as lifetime achievement awards for older members who were in some way overlooked in this respect , the academy is just following its habit of spreading the wealth the awards show is one of the world s most elite popularity contests , but in order to understand how the awards function and the academy s more baffling choices \( where is paul giamatti \? \) , it is important to understand that this insular organization is also strangely democratic the democratic urge starts with the nominations and to understand the academy awards , you have to understand the nominations currently , 183 cinematographers select the nominees for cinematography , 375 directors pick those for director , and 128 documentary filmmakers select the nominees in their branch with 1 , 277 members , the actors' branch constitutes the largest voting bloc by a third , one reason so many acting awards go to big , showy performances most nominees are chosen through preferential voting that means if your first four preferences for director are guy maddin , joel schumacher , oliver stone and manoel de oliveira \( none of whom made the cut \) , but your fifth is alexander payne \( who did \) , your vote still counts the academy works hard to make sure that no member is left behind not that the academy does n't play favorites perhaps the starkest examples of this favoritism is in the leadingactor category , where repeat winners are the rule , not the exception seventy percent of the actors who have won an oscar for a leading performance have been nominated at least one other time in the same category laurence olivier racked up nine nominations for actor , jack nicholson eight , while marlon brando , jack lemmon and dustin hoffman each earned seven it seemed improbable at the time that a newcomer like adrien brody , who won actor for the pianist , could beat out contenders like daniel daylewis but if a newcomer takes on the mantle of tragedy as a dying drunk or a disabled scrapper his odds of winning improve in truth , mr brody s win should not have been such a surprise every other contender that year had already accrued several nominations and won at least one award playing a holocaust survivor helped mr brody \( likewise roberto benigni \) the academy likes heroes and survivors it likes villains , too , but only if they entertain tom cruise s performance as a misogynist selfhelp guru in paul thomas anderson s 1999 film magnolia won the star a nomination for supporting actor , but the character was too dark , the movie financially negligible , so michael caine took home the oscar for his turn as the kindly abortionist in miramax s more popular cider house rules miramax has a long history of pawning off bologna as foie gras the company s influence and the academy s parochialism are most transparent in the foreignlanguage category since 1993 , miramax has had at least one nominee in that category in 1998 , it had three its longstanding rival , sony pictures classics , had the remaining two the domination of these companies testifies to their savvy and muscle , but reflects poorly on the academy film organizations from foreign countries put forth the nominees , which is how pablum like the chorus , a hit in france \( and a miramax title \) , are nominated the academy screens each submission just once and on a double bill , which can be disastrous for a slowmoving entry paired with a crowdpleaser films with american distribution have an obvious edge the reason foreignlanguage films matter is that they have often served as a bellwether for aesthetic adventurousness in the american movie industry following world war ii , as european film production resumed and titles from abroad began trickling and then pouring in , the academy instituted an honorary award for foreignlanguage films among the films to receive such awards were classics like akira kurosawa s rashomon the big hollywood news for 1956 was the bestpicture winner around the world in 80 days , a bloated spectacle from an increasingly moribund industry but history remembers the foreignlanguage film nominations among that year s nominees was la strada , whose director , federico fellini , would receive 12 nominations from a besotted academy before winning an honorary oscar in 1992 \( and , yes , he died the next year \) during the 1950 s , classics of foreignlanguage cinema continued to receive nominations even jeanpaul sartre earned a writing nod in the 1960 s , the academy s writing branch singled out marguerite duras and vladimir nabokov , alain robbegrillet and michelangelo antonioni in 1968 , the director s branch nominated gillo pontecorvo for the battle of algiers good films still get nominated this year the writing branch nominated two of the finest american films from last year , before sunset and eternal sunshine of the spotless mind but the nearinvisibility of foreignlanguage cinema in the nominations and the absence of most of the world s leading auteurs speak to a troubling cultural isolationism hollywood was built by european immigrants who replenished their creative reserves with talent imported from the continent and the united kingdom the studios now look toward the east , but principally for remake fodder these days , they divide their resources between small but safe specialty films that rack up awards and pricey specialeffectsdriven spectacles that emphatically do not tonight all eyes will be focused on humanscaled nominees like sideways and million dollar baby , even if the movies that drive the new american movie machine are fueled by technical and scientific achievements inside the goldplated statuettes , the heart and mind of the artist may yearn to be free but what we know from today s academy awards is that in the long struggle between art and industry , art is taking a serious beating film correction march 13 , 2005 , sunday a frontpage article in this section on feb 27 about the history of the academy awards referred incorrectly to the character played by roberto benigni in life is beautiful , for which he won the oscar as best actor the character , guido , did not survive the holocaust
boston , feb 24 the researchers whose findings led the new york city health department to warn of a rare and possibly virulent strain of hiv defended on thursday their decision to notify city officials , saying the virus presented a serious threat to public health giving a detailed account of their investigation for the first time at a scientific meeting here , the researchers said their discovery of the potentially more aggressive strain in a new york city man with multiple sexual partners was reason enough to sound the alarm dr david ho , director of the aaron diamond aids research laboratory in manhattan , which first identified the possible new strain , said i think we have a unique convergence of a very drugresistant virus , and this infection was very , very rapid and this man has many , many sexual partners while the broad outlines of the case have been known since feb 11 , when dr thomas r frieden , the new york city health commissioner , announced the findings at a news conference , dr ho was given the opportunity by organizers of the 12th annual retrovirus conference to present his team s latest findings in a special symposium arranged to deal with the issues raised by the new york case , dr ho presented his case to thousands of the world s top aids experts at the hynes convention center he said it was unique not only among all those the aaron diamond center had ever seen , but also among all the cases cataloged in the laboratory at los alamos , which collects data of the gene sequences and other molecular biology information of hiv isolates from around the country he said that while it was still not known whether the new york case was isolated or part of a cluster , alerting the health department was the right thing to do that is a decision we stand by today , he said some scientists and members of gay rights groups have criticized the disclosure as premature and unnecessarily alarmist , but there is little doubt that the strain of hiv was resistant to three of the four licensed classes of antiretroviral drugs used to combat the aids virus although drugresistant aids viruses are thought to be less potent than those that respond to drugs , dr ho and a colleague , dr martin markowitz , said that may not be true in this case in fact , they said , the virus replicated well in the laboratory , which they called worrisome the researchers' report outlined the steps they had taken to determine whether the patient progressed rapidly from hiv infection to aids because of an immune system problem or because the virus was particularly aggressive scientists can test for a number of genetic markers that indicate whether a patient is unusually susceptible to such a quick progression dr ho s team reported that it had found none of the key indicators that usually signal rapid progression of the virus dr ho said they had several more tests yet to run but even when all the tests are complete , he said , there will still be room for doubt the scientific community simply does n't know enough about genetic markers for disease progression , dr ho said in an interview before the presentation there could be other markers that we cannot look at , so we can never exclude genetics , because the knowledge is incomplete it takes on average about 10 years for a person to develop aids after infection but the range is wide some people may develop aids after about 20 years , while others get the disease within a year or so the team cited other research showing the likelihood of progression to aids 6 months after infection to be 7 in 10 , 000 , and in 12 months 45 in 10 , 000 that means , the scientists said , that the new york city man whose case led to the investigation would be in the top 05 percentile the patient is a 46yearold gay man who tested positive for hiv in december another test showed that the man had antibodies to hiv , indicating that he had been infected for more than three months , but less than 20 , dr ho said he said the patient s description of his sexual history led the researchers to believe that infection probably occurred in october in particular , the man described two nights when he took crystal methamphetamine and was more vulnerable to infection because he was the recipient of unprotected anal sex , which was not his usual practice , dr ho said the man began to feel ill in early november while he stopped using crystal meth , he continued having sex with about 10 partners until the end of december , the report said by early february , the man had lost at least nine pounds and had symptoms that met the definition of aids
park city , kan , march 5 in his crisp beige uniform , cap and badge , dennis l rader took his job upholding the most mundane city laws with unusual earnestness he was often seen in his white truck , the words compliance officer , park city painted on the side , puttering along at 10 miles an hour , searching for overgrown lawns , overflowing trash cans or dogs wandering past their fences he looked for absolutely everything , and he must have enforced every rule there ever was just because he could , i guess , said barbara walters , 69 , a retired auditor for the internal revenue service , who challenged a 25 ticket that mr rader issued in 1998 , saying her dog , shadow , was running loose ms walters s lawyer said mr rader arrived for court more prepared than some lawyers are for murder trials , bearing a lengthy file on shadow , a videotape of the dog and a complicated system of notebook tabs linking the accusations to his evidence mr rader , and his pile of paper , won but the police say the man who was a stickler for the slightest pet infraction in this modest suburb of wichita had also slain 10 people by then , as the killer known as btk investigators say that mr rader , who will turn 60 on wednesday , almost certainly in the solitary jail cell where he has been held since he was charged last week with 10 counts of murder , is one of the nation s most notorious and elusive serial killers , the strangler who toyed with wichita for three decades in letters and poems and packages and who long ago insisted that the public call him btk , for his preferred method bind , torture , kill lawyers for mr rader , who has yet to enter a plea in the case , did not return calls most stunning for the wichita area , where mr rader has spent his life , is not just that he was viewed as an ordinary fellow , someone who blended in at the taco bell , but that he seemed to have stayed meticulously and constantly within the strictest mores of society more so , at times , than many other residents mr rader and his wife of 34 years went to church each sunday sometimes when he left an afterwork bar outing to hurry home , his colleagues would privately breathe a sigh of relief with him gone , they could drink up and tell offcolor jokes as far back as the eighth grade , mr rader was picked for the prestigious school patrol , who carried big red stop signs and told classmates and drivers when to go and when not to the thing to remember is that we always thought in the end that btk would be a local , that he would probably even be a functioning member of the community , said richard lamunyon , who led the wichita police department at the height of the investigation years ago but i guess we never dreamed he would be functioning quite to this degree a church leader , a boy scout leader , someone quite so known , quite so public many serial killers have led relatively successful lives , with steady jobs and relationships , in contrast with their popular image as loners and drifters but experts on serial killings say that the portrait of mr rader takes that notion of stability , authority and prominence in the community to a level rarely seen in wichita , where a generation of police officers spent their careers searching for btk deconstructing his tangled , grisly writings , studying dozens of psychological profiles and swabbing dna from the cheeks of 4 , 000 residents some older detectives have now come to mr lamunyon wondering whether they should have found mr rader , who was hardly hiding away , decades sooner after all , his name should have appeared on at least two broad lists of suspects in the 1970 s , mr lamunyon said , and mr rader had other tenuous ties to 3 of the 10 victims born on march 9 , 1945 , dennis lynn rader was the eldest of four boys who grew up in a workingclass neighborhood in wichita , a city of fewer than 170 , 000 then his father , bill , who died in 1996 after retiring as a plant operator at a utility company s generating station , was strict but never cruel , mr rader s childhood friends recalled raders are a little bit stubborn , but not mean , said lee rader , 73 , who was a first cousin of bill rader and lives in springfield , mo like much of the extended family in sturdy towns across the midwest , lee rader said he could not remember a time when bill rader s family had done anything that might draw notice , much less cross the law there is some divorces , i guess that s the worst thing that s going , he said dennis rader s young life seemed uncomplicated and happily ordinary to roger farthing , who grew up with him mr rader buried himself in dimestore novels and comic books he played cops and robbers until dark and he posed a question to the teacher on the first day of the first grade , a question few here let him forget what time is lunch \? years later , mr rader reminisced on that simpler time in the riverview roundup , a questionnaire for his gradeschool reunion , he listed his favorite memories in big block letters recess , story times , last days of school , snowball fights broken up by the principal , art class , a nearby candy store , an old merrygoround and , of course , lunch hour asked for any pearls of wisdom , mr rader wrote do it now life is complicated and short so stay young at heart as long as possible it was so easy in '59 after high school , mr rader tried several semesters at two colleges but soon joined the air force , learning to repair wire and antenna systems , and leaving wichita for four years , the longest he would ever be away he returned in 1970 and settled down with paula dietz , who had grown up here , too , gone to the same high school , and lived just around the corner from the squat house in park city where they would soon have a boy , brian , and a girl , kerri while attending a community college , mr rader worked for a year on an assembly line at the coleman company , making heating and cooling units from 1973 to 1979 , he took classes at wichita state university , earning a bachelor s degree his major was criminal justice the killings begin on jan 15 , 1974 , btk struck wichita for the first time , although most residents would not learn those initials , or even that a serial killer was on the loose , for several years the scene was ghastly , unlike anything this city had seen before four members of the otero family joseph , 38 , a retired air force officer julie , 34 , who had worked at the coleman company about a month before and two of their children , josephine , 11 , and joseph ii , 9 were strangled inside their home in the middle of the day with the cord used in venetian blinds left behind was a uniquely grisly scene , and one whose details would be echoed in the future killings the phone line had been cut the oteros had been bound , and the police noted that the knots were particularly elaborate the killer had taken at least one souvenir of the day a watch none of the oteros had been sexually assaulted , though josephine s body was found partly clothed , hanging from a sewer pipe in the basement not far from the girl , there in the basement , semen was found , as it would be in subsequent killings investigators quickly believed they were searching for a sexual deviant , someone who took pleasure in tying people up , watching them gasp for air and die slowly some of the victims' faces were left bloated , investigators said , suggesting that the killer would strangle them , let them breathe , then strangle them some more the otero case would be the first and last known time that btk would kill a man or a child the rest of the victims were all women , seemingly picked at random , and in ages ranging from 21 to 62 years old nine months later , after the police announced a possible confession in the otero case , the killer s first letter appeared it took credit for the otero deaths , mentioned details that the police said only the killer would have known , and expressed frustration that someone else might be trying to assume credit for the deaths the letter was riddled with typographical and spelling errors i ca n't stop it so the monster goes on , and hurt me as well as society , the letter said he noted that he would be waiting in the dark , waiting , waiting , and closed the letter with a postscript the code words for me will be bind them , toture them , kill them , btk , you see he at it again they will be on the next victim but by then the killer had already struck again kathryn bright , who also worked at coleman , was stabbed to death inside her house in april her phone lines were snipped , and she was bound with a knotted cord in the security business soon after mr rader started a job at adt , the security company , at the end of 1974 , he was widely disliked particularly by those beneath him after he became supervisor for the alarm installers he was deeply competent , organized , and good at what he did , but he was a taskmaster , said rick carr , 68 , who sold systems for adt he came in with the attitude you 're here to get the job done , and i'm not here to be someone s pal in his gray adt uniform shirt with dennis above the pocket , mr rader worked for 14 years in what others called the dungeon , the section of the office with no windows , gray walls and a steel door but his job also sent him out of the office during the day regularly , to sign off on installations at company swimming pool parties at the carrs' home in wichita , martha carr , mr carr s former wife , said mr rader always arrived cheerily with his wife and children , looked people right in the eye and said all the right things that the party was lovely , the food was nicely arranged paula rader , meanwhile , was a fabulous cook and a quiet , sweet woman who seemed to have a loving , happy marriage , ms carr said she seemed innocent , ms carr said , not worldly , you know \? one regular topic of discussion at adt , not surprisingly , was btk it was the conversation all over town , but this was a security company , and let s face it btk increased our business , said denise mattocks , 46 , who worked alongside mr rader for years ms mattocks , who was single at the time , was particularly fearful of btk , she said , and told mr rader so regularly like so many in wichita as the panic grew , she spoke of checking her telephone for a dial tone every time she got home mr rader , she recalled , said little in response if anything , his efforts at conversation leaned more to his life at home his wife , the tomatoes in his garden , his boy scout outings mr rader became a scout leader when his son , brian , was about 8 and could join pack 491 mr rader held the boys to strict standards , not letting them slide by , as some fathers did , without perfecting skills for a badge , said george j martin , 70 , who helped lead the pack mr rader was particularly capable , mr martin said , when it came to the knots the boys had to learn the sheepshank , the bowline , the half hitch , the monkey fist , he remembered , dennis knew them all the letters stop by the late 1970 s , btk had killed seven people , the police say , and the eerie , taunting letters kept arriving one letter was traced to a copier at wichita state university and in 1979 , after btk apparently broke into a widow s home and waited without success for her to come home , he sent a poem to the woman who never arrived oh , anna why did n't you appear in part , the poem read alone again i trod in pass memory of mirrors , and ponder why fornumber eight was not and then the letters suddenly stopped the police say btk killed three more women in 1985 , 1986 and 1991 including two cases , one from park city and another from nearby , that were not linked to btk publicly until last weekend some people , like al thimmesch , a retired wichita police officer , wonder whether more deaths have yet to be identified as the work of btk but if the police are right , the serial killings ended on jan 19 , 1991 , with the death of dolores davis , whose house is near park city in may 1991 , mr rader was hired as a park city compliance officer , a period one resident of this suburb just north of wichita calls the start of the reign of terror for homeowners here mr rader s critics here say he seemed to sit in his truck , just waiting for something to go wrong with their houses he took numerous photos of their homes , they said , in search of something awry some people even insist that he sometimes let their dogs out himself , then cited the owners rhonda reno said she watched one day as mr rader wandered on the lawn of a neighbor who was ill and unable to mow the grass walking the grass with a yardstick , she said , he measured for infractions i never trusted him , said jim reno , her husband there were two people i keep an eye on in this block and one was him still , others here liked mr rader , and found his outsized enthusiasm for his inspection work charming he helped an elderly resident trap skunks , and helped his neighbor , a single woman , by mowing her lawn and fixing her leaky faucets , the neighbor said and even he could bend the rules another woman , virginia jackson , 53 , recalled when her boxer got loose and mr rader chased down the dog and , after a struggle , managed to bring it home ms jackson never got a ticket he was very professional , she said he was doing his job breaking his silence last january , the wichita eagle published an article about btk to mark the 30th anniversary of the otero killings and the start of the panic by then , the case had been forgotten by many the article suggested that btk might have moved away or even died two months later , btk wrote a letter , his first in a quarter century from there , he embarked on a communication frenzy 10 letters or packages mailed to newspapers and media outlets , or simply left in parks he filled these , too , with trinkets , some apparently from the killings photographs , a word puzzle , a doll with a plastic bag over its head , a necklace , a computer disk and a victim s driver s license by last weekend , with help from the disk and dna evidence , the police took mr rader into custody and announced with great fanfare that btk had been caught looking back , some people wonder if the wichita police could have made an arrest sooner mr lamunyon , the former police chief , tells those who ask that he does not believe an arrest was possible over all those years the btk s newest mailings , many of which contained a mellower , more conciliatory tone than years before , created a whole new room full of evidence for investigators to go on still , he acknowledged that mr rader s name was probably included on two long lists drawn up by the police years ago the police had gathered the names of coleman employees at one point because the first two women killed had worked there , as had , it turned out , mr rader they had also collected the names of white men at wichita state in the 1970 s because they knew that one of btk s letters had been copied on campus and that a poem sent by btk resembled a song taught in a popular professor s folklore seminar at wichita state there was another link , too although the police had not publicly connected the death of marine hedge , the eighth victim , to btk until last weekend , at the time of her death , ms hedge lived six houses down the street from mr rader s home in park city i think the police made a mistake over the years , said robert beattie , a wichita lawyer who is writing a btk book they were looking for a charles manson type charles liles , a former wichita police officer , said the police focused too narrowly on convicted sex offenders rather than someone who might live right among them the rev michael g clark , mr rader s pastor , visited him in jail on wednesday , a glass wall between the pastor and his church council president mr rader is doing as well as can be expected , mr clark said his own disbelief , though , has not worn off the more he reflects , mr clark said , the more he remembers only ordinary conversations with mr rader , talks about fishing and his mother s health that s what i 've realized , mr clark said there is nothing to remember , nothing that would make it all make sense park city , meanwhile , quietly fired mr rader last week , saying only that he had failed to show up for work or to call correction march 10 , 2005 , thursday because of an editing error , a frontpage article on sunday about dennis l rader , who is suspected of being the serial killer known as btk , omitted a word in some copies from a passage about public revelations about killings in 1985 and 1991 until the previous weekend , they were not linked publicly to btk
beijing , april 19 china s foreign minister called tuesday for an end to antijapanese protests , the first signal that the leadership may no longer welcome the sometimes violent demonstrations that have underpinned a new and more confrontational approach to japan the minister , li zhaoxing , told a meeting of the communist party s propaganda department attended by 3 , 500 people that government , military and party officials , as well as the masses , should stay off the streets , state media reported cadres and the masses must believe in the party and the government s ability to properly handle all issues linked to sinojapanese relations , mr li was quoted as saying calmly , rationally and legally express your own views do not attend marches that have not been approved do not do anything that might upset social stability mr li s comments , carried on national television , amounted to the first direct call by a top official to wind down the protests by tens of thousands of urban residents the demonstrations have continued on three successive weekends , becoming china s most sustained street protests since the prodemocracy uprising of 1989 until now , the protests have enjoyed at least tacit approval from the central government although none of the major marches in beijing , shanghai and several other cities received formal permits , the police had not made consistent efforts to prevent them or to arrest people responsible for vandalizing japanese diplomatic missions or private property in the marches in recent public appearances , mr li refrained from criticizing protesters and accused japan of instigating the protests by provoking china on issues including territorial disputes , distorted history textbooks and visits to tokyo s war shrine mr li reiterated that japan must take responsibility for the unrest because it has continued to whitewash the history of its world war iiera occupation of china he rejected calls by the japanese government for apologies or compensation for damaged japanese property but his appeal to rein in the protests most likely reflects the views of top leaders , who may have concluded that little is to be gained from further protests and that social stability is at some risk if they continue unchecked cadres must resolutely implement the major policies of the central party leadership and resolutely safeguard overall political stability and unity , he said the suggestion that officials must resolutely implement leadership decisions hints at a possible divergence of opinions over how to manage the protests in communist history , unclear or contradictory orders from the top have often provided an opening for public protests and made the police reluctant to exert their authority it is unclear if elements in the leadership structure had different views this time , but mr li implied that lower level officials would be held responsible for carrying out the new mandate the big test of the order will come next week urban residents have been sending text and email messages to one another calling for major marches on may 1 , china s traditional labor day , and on may 4 may 4 is significant in chinese history because it is the anniversary of the first major studentled nationalist uprising , in 1919 popular outrage over the versailles treaty , which gave germancontrolled territory in china to japan after world war i , sparked that protest authorities generally step up surveillance and harassment of critics of the government on such anniversaries to guard against unrest  japan steps up criticism of china \( the new york times \) , tokyo , april 19 with china refusing to apologize for antijapanese protests , japan s leadership stepped up criticism of beijing on tuesday , even as japan s population seemed to back a more cautious stance prime minister junichiro koizumi dismissed china s complaints that his visits to yasukuni shrine , where class a war criminals are enshrined , were an insult to the chinese and an obstacle to better relations each country has its own history , tradition and different views , he said hardliners in the ruling liberal democratic party have drowned out isolated criticism of mr koizumi people are expected to offer an apology and compensation if they damage other people s property , said shoichi nakagawa , the minister of economy , trade and industry
alas , it s safe to assume that whatever dick affolter and pete bodette saw and photographed in lake champlain on a clear , still afternoon in july will not provide the champologists and cryptozoologists of the world with anything resembling proof that there really is a mysterious sea creature living in the lake , which stretches for 120 miles between the united states and canada it would be easier to roll your eyes and dismiss their murky video and their vivid tale of a huge , serpentlike sea creature that swam just beneath the surface for 45 minutes , if the two were not serious fishermen , upstanding citizens and people who know virtually all the critters in and around lake champlain and had no apparent motive for trying to pull off a hoax for the ages it would also be easier to be convinced that they had actually come up with something significant if the video they took on mr bodette s digital camera showed something more revealing than a long , narrow shape moving for a very long time in the still waters of the lake but since people have been tantalized for 400 years , whether by reports of a terrifying lake champlain sea monster or the cute , lovable , nessielike champ of car wash and restaurant signs in vermont and upstate new york , why should we expect anything more definitive now \? so , for those thrilled by the thought of that 26footlong giant squid photographed for the first time off the bonin islands 600 miles south of tokyo , consider the tale of two vermont fishermen and the latest chapter in upstate s longestrunning wildlife adventure like its spiritual cousin in loch ness , at pretty much the same latitude due east , whatever might be in lake champlain has proved elusive for centuries , despite hundreds of reported sightings and a small cottage industry of true believers alternately likened to an eel , a snake , a serpent , a sea monster , a prehistoric creature and lord knows what else , it s a part of the champlain mindset , a lure to local tourism , a source of fascination and an alluring riddle in 1873 , pt barnum , not best known as a fisheries biologist , offered a reward of 50 , 000 for hide of the great champlain serpent to add to my mammoth world s fair show enter mr affolter , 64 , a retired defense attorney and a graduate of cornell university law school , and mr bodette , 35 , his stepson and a fuel company sales manager , who has spent most of his life near the lake as the two tell it , they were fishing for salmon near the mouth of the ausable river , about a third of the way down the lake , when they noticed something that looked like a log floating about 100 feet from their boat intrigued , they trolled toward it until , to their amazement , it submerged like a submarine only to resurface about a halfhour later , and they were able to watch it for another 45 minutes neither can tell you for sure what they saw other than that it was enormous , very clearly alive and unlike anything they had ever seen , at least 15 feet long , elongated like a snake or serpent they say it had a head shaped like a sledgehammer , produced a high bifurcated wake , lacked the familiar dorsal fins of a fish and apparently did not need to come up for air like a dolphin or whale they reject suggestions it was something familiar mating snakes , a giant sturgeon , large otters i'm not some guy who came fishing for a weekend and thought he saw something funny , said mr bodette i 've fished all over the world i 've been on this lake since i was a little kid and i believe we saw something there that not many people have seen i have no idea what it is but i'm pretty certain what i saw is n't anything you 'll find in any fish and wildlife books unfortunately , the video , viewed at the office of scott shagin , an intellectualproperty lawyer in paramus , nj , shows nothing more than a long dark shape impossible to categorize that floats at a distance and at one point seems to go under their boat the men can be heard talking excitedly , describing it as being like a serpent but no head emerges from the water , and in the end it s impossible to be sure what was seen mr shagin took the video to melanie lj stiassny , curator of fishes at the american museum of natural history , and some of her colleagues there they were seriously underwhelmed the evidence i was presented was singularly unconvincing , she said we did n't see anything that led any of us to feel anything other than bemused as to what led these guys to think this was anything so special it certainly was n't any large vertebrate we 're sure of that a study in 2003 in the magazine skeptical inquirer , which tends to debunk claims of the paranormal , concluded that the tales over the years have been so contradictory as to be meaningless , and that there is no serious evidence any such creature exists one cannot draw a conclusion from a lack of knowledge , and so , until an actual specimen presents itself , the possibility that any large unknown animal inhabits lake champlain remains somewhere between extraordinarily slim and none but some local scientists , including ellen marsden , a fisheries biologist at the university of vermont , say the sightings are so numerous that it s certainly possible there s something intriguing and unexplained in the lake , if not necessarily a 10 , 000yearold dinosaur and besides the multitude of sightings , believers tend to point to two bulwarks of the modern champ canon first is a 1977 photograph , taken with a kodak instamatic camera by a woman named sandra mansi , of a large serpentine neck emerging from the water of what she said was lake champlain she does not have the negative and waited several years to make the picture public , so its authenticity is easy to question and impossible to prove but her lawyer said that ms mansi could no more have constructed such a hoax than put a satellite in orbit second is a 2003 study by fauna communications research institute , a nonprofit institute that studies animal communication it conducted audio research in the lake and found evidence of echolocation , a highfrequency signal that allows animals to detect sounds and identify objects underwater a highly sophisticated response it said was associated only with dolphins and whales , neither of which live in the lake what we can say is that there is a creature in the lake that produces biosonar , and we have no idea what it is , the institute s report concluded on the other hand , a recent lake study by researchers at middlebury college , in vermont , found nothing similar as it is , the only thing people do agree on is that almost everyone wants to believe there is something unknown , magical out in the lake mr affolter , for his part , says he does n't know what he saw in lake champlain , and part of him hopes no one else does either everything gets demystified , he said we 're all so jaded maybe this is better as a mystery that s never solved

federal meteorologists have sent mixed signals as to whether the state had a drought this summer some areas had plenty of rain , others almost none but ledyard lewis , a farmer in north stonington , does n't need an official ruling he knows a drought when he feels one you pick it up in your hand and it s just like sawdust , mr lewis said about his corn crop if this is n't a drought , i do n't know what is we went july 8 to september with no rain his corn has been hit hard the stalks have grown to a height of only 8 feet , down from a high of 12 feet , and , worse , the ears are puny storms in the middle of last month came too late for farms in the central and eastern parts of the state conditions there are so bad , with rainfall just a fraction of normal , that agriculture officials in the state are planning an emergency meeting later this month to discuss the dry conditions and gather damage estimates it would then be up to gov m jodi rell to ask the head of the united states department of agriculture to declare a drought disaster in the state such a designation would qualify farmers for federal aid , much of it in lowinterest loans governor rell said last month that the state would look into the dry conditions it may seem odd to be announcing this on the first rainy day we have had in weeks , but drought conditions are a real possibility , mrs rell said in a statement the extended lack of rainfall over the past few weeks and the longterm forecast for below average rainfall has me concerned while the state department of agriculture said it could not estimate how much money the dry conditions have cost farmers , the farmers themselves have a good idea mr lewis would n't give a dollar figure , but said his income would be down 25 percent peter charter , a farmer in ellington , estimated his damages at 4 , 000 to 5 , 000 clark woodmansee , a farmer in preston , estimated his crop loss at 15 , 000 and ned ellis of hebron said he had lost between 10 , 000 to 20 , 000 the drought particularly hurt dairy farmers by coinciding with the thirstiest months for corn , from tasseling through ear development tasseling is when the strings for pollination grow at the top of the stalk the development of the ears follows and continues until the harvest farmers use the corn to feed their cows they chop the stalks and ears into what is called silage much of this year s silage will be stored and used as feed later this year and into next summer many farmers will buy grain from out of state and use surpluses from previous years to get through the shortage mr ellis said his farm produced 17 to 18 tons of corn silage per acre this year , down from the usual 22 tons he said the stalks grew to a decent height because rainfall was normal until july then the rain stopped , the stalks withered and the ears did not fill out they have smaller diameters and many are half the normal length mr woodmansee said he just harvested his worst crop ever we did n't get much second or third crop of hay , he said everything s just dried up the drought has also made it more difficult to get water to livestock , especially dairy cows , while they are in pasture because many wells and ponds have run dry mr lewis was hauling water in his pickup truck to 100 beef cows 300 gallons a trip , three trips a day mr ellis s dairy cows have been searching for water at their usual watering holes , some of which have become muddy because of the lack of rain several cows became stuck in the mud in august and one died i 've never seen it this bad , mr ellis said the fertilizer fellow was n't even recommending people put it on for a fertilizer dealer not to recommend it , that tells you how dry it is mansfield , in windham county , for example , saw only 034 inches , compared to the average of 39 inches in august , said joyce meader , a dairy and livestock teacher with the cooperative extension system of the university of connecticut in july , it received 118 inches , versus the average 38 inches in contrast , one of the wetter counties was litchfield it received 281 inches in july , compared to the average 49 inches , but 438 inches in august \( average 474 inches \) , according to janet fisher at the northeast regional climate center at cornell university all of connecticut , she said , received 421 inches in july and 192 inches in august , compared to averages of 419 and 439 inches despite the experiences of farmers , meteorologists in most cases have not called the dry conditions a drought online maps of the united states drought monitor , which tracks drought conditions , showed that there was a drought in connecticut for just one week in midseptember the rest of the summer was just abnormally dry but nicole belk , a hydrologist at the national weather service in taunton , mass , said that connecticut is indeed suffering from a drought a large part of connecticut is in meteorological and agricultural drought , she said she added that in the next few months , closertonormal precipitation is likely to relieve the drought william simpson , a weather forecaster at the service in taunton , said rainfall deficits may get lost in the averages numbers can lie , mr simpson said we could get five inches in one day and it could all flow off , whereas a few inches spread out over weeks will percolate more john breakell , state executive director of the farm service agency of the federal agriculture department , has another explanation for the confusion about whether it is a drought they were n't big wide storms , mr breakell said they were little cells a tremendous downpour might dump an inch one place and not at all up the road that s one reason why they had such a different effect across the state in new london , marsha jette , the county executive director with the farm service agency , said lots of farmers reported cows dying in the heat milk production was way down , she said , and vegetables were cooking on the vine nancy welsh , the executive director with the farm service agency for middlesex and new haven counties , said crop damage was exacerbated by heavy rainstorms in june that brought in diseases it caused the crop to just die , no matter what they sprayed , she said then we went into dry conditions , so stuff they replanted just shriveled up and died for most dairy farmers , ms meader said , it s not going to be easy to make matters worse , economists predicted that the price of milk will fall , she said the state has less than 200 dairy farms , with an average herd size of 113 cows dairy is the largest agricultural business here in terms of land use nursery and garden supply , the largest business in terms of income , felt the drought s impact less , ms meader said many farmers also count on selling their surpluses for income mr charter in ellington said his hay yield is 30 to 40 percent less than normal we usually sell the surplus hay , and this year there s no surplus to sell , he said he said he hoped the federal government would declare his county a disaster area and send aid but farm aid takes many months , he said

a rutgers university task force is recommending creation of a college of arts and sciences that would standardize admissions criteria , graduation requirements and other procedures under the proposal , some rutgers colleges would function as campuses , but no longer by name as colleges the suggestion , which is part of a 175page report that is scheduled for release on monday , was criticized yesterday by the associate alumnae of douglass college , which introduced a web site earlier in the day , savedouglasscollegeorg , calling for the measure s defeat the group said the proposal would mean the end of douglass college the university president , richard l mccormick , said in a telephone interview last night that the report would undergo months of discussion he noted that the plan was not calling for a merger the colleges would retain their distinct qualities it recommends creating something that every other research university has , a college of arts and sciences , dr mccormick said and it recommends calling our residential campuses what they are residential campuses he created the 75member task force on undergraduate education in april 2004 to guarantee that in emphasizing research , rutgers does not shortchange undergraduates on courses and access to faculty members in addition , dr mccormick said , he wanted to bring unity to what he called a patchwork quilt of schools and programs situated in new brunswick and piscataway besides douglass , which is an allwomen s college , rutgers college , livingston college and university college would all be affected what it does , it effectively ends douglass college , said sheila kelly hampton , class of '70 , who is president of the douglass alumnae group by calling it a campus , they just are talking about where someone happens to live they do n't address many of the student life issues and program issues dr mccormick disagreed douglass will be as it is now , a women sonly campus , and will continue to have its signature courses on women , retain its distinctive mission and continue to reflect its unique history , he said each individual college now sets its own criteria in certain areas , including admissions , honors programs and graduation requirements , and none have faculties of their own they are served by a general faculty of arts and sciences , he said a new college of arts and sciences , under a unified structure , would simplify standards for students , faculty and administrators , and get faculty members more involved with students , he added but the executive director of the alumnae , rachel ingber , class of '83 , said eliminating colleges does not bring faculty closer to students it creates one huge university where undergraduates do n't have small colleges where they can get academic advice on curriculum programs and the unique mission that douglass college provides for women
the night before a fight last year , jason thompson dreamed he would easily win his match but when he arrived for the fight , he learned he was scheduled 13th out of 14 bouts and would be entering the ring around midnight he waited six hours for his turn , during which time he dozed off and had several new dreams , none of which portended victory he subsequently lost the fight , then went home to find that after having spent the afternoon napping , he could not sleep thompson tells the story for laughs , but he did not get into boxing to be funny he is still trying to fulfill the prophecy of leonard king , a former trainer who , before dying of cancer in 1997 , predicted that thompson would be a champion , first as an amateur and then as a professional about 8 years and 40 fights later , he is finally on the verge of the first goal thompson will fight anthony irons in the finals of the 152pound open division of the new york golden gloves championships today at madison square garden if he wins , thompson , 24 , will at last turn pro let s be honest it s been a rough road for me so far , said thompson , who is from flatbush , brooklyn , and resembles a pintsized sonny liston i'm like the guy that no one expects to win , the guy who people do n't think about four years ago , his car overheated on the way to the golden gloves and was rearended by another vehicle thompson was eventually picked up by a trainer driving to the tournament , but he arrived too late for his bout another time , he came in over his weight , jumped rope for an hour to lose five pounds , but ended up exhausted and the loser in a decision until now , the deepest he had gone in the gloves was the semifinals , and even that match was dashed with controversy thompson knocked his opponent down in the second round , but the referee ruled it a slip he s gotten robbed by judges , lost close decisions because he was n't expected to win his fights everything that can happen to a fighter has happened to him , said mike smith , a trainer at gleason s gym , where thompson trains in the long run , though , that s what s going to make you a better fighter learning to deal with adversity builds toughness , and that s what jason is thompson grew up in the shadows of the vanderveer estates , a rough housing complex , and disaster was always a step away he dropped out of erasmus hall in the ninth grade my biggest worry was that he was n't going to live to see his next birthday , said his mother , paulette , a marketing specialist for a clothing retailer then he found boxing , and it saved his life it was like something from a movie , art imitating life it just clicked he walked into gleason s gym at age 17 , equipped with a passion to learn but no money to pay a trainer king , known as old man panama , offered to teach him for free on the conditions that he arrived on time and worked hard after king died , rogelio jackson , a former fighter under king , took over as thompson s trainer they treated me like a family , thompson said when nobody else wanted anything to do with me , they took me in to this day , thompson has never been knocked down in a fight he has avoided calamity in the gloves this year by arriving early and in shape for his three bouts , all of which he dominated my whole career i thought i was missing something , because i never made it this far , he said the truth is , if i had made it to the gloves years ago , i would have turned pro but king said i was going to be a champion , and now i'm here
east rutherford , nj , dec 17 before the giants' game against the kansas city chiefs on saturday , chase blackburn was a rookie linebacker who had not started a games and had no tackles on defense his biography in the giants' news media guide did not even include a photograph but blackburn was thrust into last night s spotlight because of injuries to two of the giants' starting linebackers with a less experienced defense , the giants still stood tall in a 2717 victory at giants stadium the giants called their first audible about three hours before the opening kickoff linebacker carlos emmons , who usually starts at the strong side , aggravated an injury to his pectoral muscle during practice late in the week and had difficulty extending his arm so emmons was deactivated , joining middle linebacker antonio pierce on the sideline pierce , the giants' leading tackler , had sustained a high ankle sprain against philadelphia last sunday i 'd lie if i said i was n't nervous at all , said blackburn , who was signed as a free agent out of akron in june right before the game , i found out i was getting the start you get nervous right then you get a little jittery , and everything runs through your mind blackburn was not the only nervous giant coach tom coughlin said he was concerned about how his players would respond to so many injuries both starting offensive tackles were also out so coughlin summoned some of his veterans , including defensive end michael strahan , and told them to spread a message everyone needed to stay focused , even the youngsters the word obviously got through he did an outstanding job , coughlin said of blackburn blackburn , 22 , started as the middle linebacker and had nine tackles nick greisen remained as the weakside linebacker and reggie torbor played at the strong side torbor , a secondyear player , had started seven games , but none since nov 13 against minnesota had emmons been healthy , the musical chairs would have stopped with greisen in the middle , emmons at the weak side and blackburn in his usual role on special teams , where he had made 15 tackles the giants were unable to stop larry johnson , who rushed for 167 yards on 31 carries he also had two touchdowns but it seemed that even if johnson had run for more yards , the chiefs , who had the nfl s topranked offense , would not have been able to convert them into points you bend , but you do n't break , greisen said that s what our defense did today greisen finished with eight tackles torbor had four blackburn was beaten on the chiefs' first offensive play as johnson blew past him for a 10yard gain and early in the second quarter , he was upended by a vicious block from wide receiver eddie kennison blackburn said that the block hurt his pride more than his body chase blackburn , welcome to the nfl , strahan said with a smile the defense gathered its composure later in the series when the chiefs had firstandgoal on the giants' 3 , but johnson managed to gain just 2 yards on three carries on thirdand1 , greisen met johnson head on , and blackburn assisted on the tackle as johnson was held for no gain the chiefs settled for a field goal chase did a great job of coming over the top because once i initially stopped him , i needed a little help to push about 400 pounds backwards , greisen said the middle linebacker acts as the defense s conductor , receiving plays from the sideline but greisen handled the playcalling , he said , as part of his role as a team leader i just knew that chase was going to be nervous out there with his first start , greisen said i just told him , 'chase , worry about your responsibilities getting lined up i 'll be sure to make the calls' as the middle linebacker , blackburn s main responsibility was to combat the run on the first series of the second half , however , johnson broke through a hole up the middle for a 14yard touchdown , tying the game , 1010 on the sideline , strahan said that he had been held by offensive lineman john welbourn until that point , strahan and defensive end osi umenyiora had not made much noise on the field they had failed to get much penetration and finished with no sacks against the chiefs' mammoth offensive line but as the game went on , the defensive line gained momentum late in the fourth quarter , chiefs quarterback trent green was pressured into throwing an interception that sealed the victory for the giants green had no touchdown passes blackburn was all smiles after the game , not just because he had performed well in his first start , but also because his mother and brother had traveled from marysville , ohio , to see the game this sounds kind of weird , he said , but i'm glad i had my mom in town
to the editor re the smokes are in the mail \( editorial , oct 30 \) it makes no sense that under the guise of good public health policy and discouraging people from purchasing tobacco products , none other than government itself gives indian reservations and internet sites a free pass while imposing severe financial hardships on licensed , legitimate business owners \( bars , taverns , clubs and their service providers \) amusement and music owners of new york demonstrates that smoking has not dropped by the large percentages that government statistics claim state and local officials have conveniently failed to include the volume of illegally , untaxed purchased tobacco products , mainly from internet sites and indian reservations , as part of their calculations on a conservative estimate , new york state is losing more than 150 million in annual tax revenues if government officials truly want to prohibit smoking , they need to make tobacco an illegal substance they need to establish a fair playing field for all parties , without favoring special interests they need to issue summonses and penalties to the people who actually violate the laws not harass responsible business owners who are tangential in the process danny frank executive director , amusement and music owners of new york new york
london , june 9 when tony blair went to washington to talk with president bush this week , he dwelt on heady topics debt and poverty , disease and decline in africa back home , though , the headlines lingered on other matters , most notably the activities also in washington of his wife , cherie blair ostensibly the debate was about one question did mrs blair exploit her husband s office by addressing a paying audience at the john f kennedy center in washington on monday night , one day before her husband met with mr bush \? or was she acting as cherie booth , her premarital name , which she uses as a prominent human rights lawyer \? whatever the answer , the british press has largely made up its mind as cherie booth , the name she insists on using as a feminist lawyer , she is entitled to a career of her own , the political editor trevor kavanagh wrote in the sun , a tabloid that is generally supportive of blair but without tony blair s massive prestige in the us , she would have been paid peanuts that is the essence of the complaints against her she is cashing in on her husband s name but the question conjured many other arguments , ranging from mrs blair s own relationship with money to a feminist question of the times how should a woman with a highflying career of her own assert her identity while addressing the pressures of raising four children and coping with a husband who has a fairly highflying job himself \? in other words , how does cherie booth relate to cherie blair \? it s a terrible sort of tightrope one is walking all the time professional life and the wife of the prime minister , she said at her washington appearance the title of the talk underscored her quandary cherie blair dynamic professional , wife of tony blair orchestra seats sold for 85 apiece as with previous conflicts between mrs blair s private and public lives , the event reflected the uncertain status of british prime ministerial spouses who , unlike american first ladies , have no separate financing or rules governing their behavior there is no such thing as the first lady of downing street in the same manner as american first ladies , the columnist anne mcelvoy wrote in the evening standard , also a tabloid , but one that is often critical of the blairs if mrs blair sets herself up as such , she must beware of the pitfalls of borrowed presidentialism she is now being asked why she does not then subscribe to the constraints of an american first lady and give the money to charity the money raised questions of its own british news reports said mrs blair received 20 , 000 to 30 , 000 , or between 36 , 500 and 56 , 000 mrs blair has not confirmed or denied that she was paid on thursday , a spokesman for the prime minister s office described the arrangements behind her visit to washington as private a reporter s effort to reach her through her law practice , matrix chambers , elicited no response the event itself was organized by the center for association leadership , and sponsored by a commercial subsidiary of its partner organization , the american society of association executives neither group would say whether mrs blair had been paid however , cnn said one of its anchors , paula zahn , who interviewed mrs blair at the event , did receive an undisclosed fee that she gave to charity mrs blair said it had been pure coincidence that mr blair chose to visit mr bush at around the same time as her own event , which , she said , was scheduled nine months ago it has crossed my mind , with all the 365 days on which tony could have come to america , that today was not the best one for him to choose , but that is just the way these things work out , she said asked separately about the controversy , mr blair told reporters in washington , i do n't think there s ever anything i can say on these things that can make it better mrs blair compared her treatment by british reporters with the generally sympathetic handling of another prime ministerial spouse denis thatcher , husband of former prime minister margaret thatcher , who also maintained business interests during the time his wife ran the country no one found anything wrong with that , mrs blair said the comparison unleashed a fresh round of comments from newspapers , some of which said mr thatcher had not been faulted for exploiting his wife s position in the same way as mrs blair has been when it comes down to it , the main difference between denis and cherie is very simple and very unfair the general public liked him , or their idea of him , and they do n't like her , or their perception of who she is , wrote john walsh in the independent mrs blair has suffered relentless ridicule and harassment by a tory press printing the ugliest pictures and mocking her clothes , friends , legal career , religion and anything they can invent to turn her into a ditzy lady macbeth , the columnist polly toynbee wrote in the guardian but none of that justifies taking this money one glimmer of support came in a letter in the evening standard from a reader , identified as denis shaw , who noted that in following her husband on official business , she was missing out on income as a lawyer why should n't she be allowed to cover her losses \? the letter asked

i hate being held responsible for my mistakes i often make hasty decisions with unfortunate consequences , so i'm a big fan of the doover , something found rarely in life but often in video games if i make a stupid move in a chess video game , i take it back and try something else if i get ambushed in an action game , i go to the last place i saved my progress and sneak up on those ambushers fire emblem the sacred stones , a strategy roleplaying game for the game boy advance from intelligent systems , wants me to suffer for every wrong step slain warriors will not magically reappear on the next level , nor can they be revived with a magic potion as the fatal blow falls , they express regret or offer encouragement to their comrades and then are gone , leaving nothing but the recriminating memory of their final moment stones begins as a peaceful emperor inexplicably invades the neighbor kingdom of resnais it falls to resnais s princess eirika and prince ephraim to lead warriors against the invaders the game s story , told in a series of long conversations , is as generic as they come , with magical objects called the sacred stones , which must be protected against powermad fiends the game has the good sense to allow players to skip story sequences , although since these scenes include useful information , an interesting story or pithier dialogue would have been preferred the drama of stones is not in its forgettable story but in the consequences of your actions the player has a topdown view of a grid battlefield on which one maneuvers troops \( the interface is essentially the same as intelligent system s wonderful advance wars military strategy series \) the game is based on turns , so you move each of your warriors and then have them attack , heal themselves or trade weapons with another warrior when all your soldiers have moved , enemy troops take their turn each attack leads to a counterattack , although archers and mages can attack soldiers without ranged weapons from a distance with no danger how far a soldier can travel is determined by various factors , with knights on horses able to go quite a way , while heavily armored foot soldiers lag behind this approach is similar to chess , but there are far more variables the game s unforgiving rules make mistakes especially costly , and you must carefully study the terrain to determine what spaces in the grid are most vulnerable a strong soldier can probably survive one attack , but at times i would not notice a nearby enemy until after my warrior was beset by a second soldier after barely surviving an earlier attack when your knight s health status bar is one tick above zero and that second soldier heads toward him , it invokes a feeling of cold dread at that point only pure luck in the guise of a missed blow will save that knight while visually stones is nothing more than tiny combatants moving across a twodimensional battlefield , the apprehension as you watch the battle unfold turns the game into a riveting drama the game is very much structured around keeping your soldiers active it is possible to send one out into battle and then send another soldier to carry the first to safety before they can be attacked there are also clerics and priests who can revive injured combatants but the lesson of stones is that in war , not everyone will survive as you travel the countryside there will be opportunities to recruit new warriors to replenish your dwindling army some are soldiers sent by allies , others war refugees or adventurers you can also occasionally recruit enemy soldiers , although this is a little tricky if you see a conversation in which one enemy soldier expresses doubts about the morality of the emperor s mad grab at power , you can persuade that soldier to join you but you must reach possible deserters on your turn , before they can attack and kill your soldier or perish themselves the game saves your progress after every move , so you cannot rectify mistakes in the middle of a battle , but you can restart battles from the beginning , and at times i would replay the same mission several times trying to shepherd my entire army through in one piece each character in the game has a distinct personality and back story , and i experienced a twinge of guilt every time i lost someone , feeling that if i were just a little bit smarter or more vigilant , i could have found a better way alas , at times i would have to accept my losses and move on according to the game , your warriors do not die but simply retire from battle after a loss , but somehow that never made me feel better as i watched them call out in anguish as they fell there are no lifeanddeath decisions in madagascar , an entertaining children s game developed by toys for bob to tie in with dreamworks s new animated movie fall into traffic or the jaws of a hungry animal , and you will instantly find yourself safe and sound and no worse for wear , ready to try again madagascar tells the story of a party of new york zoo animals that wind up on a distant tropical island the game presumably follows the plot of the movie , but the game s version of the story is very bare bones , being far more concerned with game play than plot it does have some clever touches one animal is convinced the island is a resort hotel , and some lemurs when faced with a zebra and a hippo from manhattan call them new york giants but one suspects these bits of humor were just lifted from the movie each of the animals has different skills that allow for different gameplay styles , although they all have a basic attack and can at least jump a little the hippo can run at incredible speeds by eating chili peppers , while the giraffe can spin its legs like helicopter blades to glide from one platform to the next in one mission , you can control a stealthy penguin as he tries to lead his companions in a takeover of a cargo ship in another you must lead bees to flowers before they become impatient and sting you you can also slide down a river , use a crane to toss a ship s crew overboard , throw fruit at attacking spiders and use shelter to help you pass through gusty winds none of this is especially difficult , but the mix of puzzles and arcade action makes it a fun romp while madagascar is , like many children s games , essentially just a series of minigames , it does an excellent job of integrating all its game elements into a cohesive whole those it cannot integrate , it puts in as extras , like an enjoyable miniature golf game breezy and varied , madagascar is not a game for the ages , but it is consistently diverting of course , i might convince you to buy madagascar and you might absolutely hate it no game exists that everyone agrees on perhaps you will end up cursing your foolish , hasty decision to buy a game on my recommendation if so , you will simply have to live with that decision in life , as in fire emblem

just about everyone in medicine agrees that a patient who shows up in the emergency room with a heart attack should be given aspirin that simple treatment has been proved to cut death rates by nearly a quarter but hundreds of patients at hospitals in new jersey do not get that aspirin , or nine other crucial therapies for heart attack , heart failure and pneumonia , a review of recently published hospital data shows some hospitals are better than others , but none delivered all the treatments to eligible patients , in spite of their wellknown benefit last month , the new england journal of medicine reported that , although their performance had improved somewhat from 2002 to 2004 , hospitals across the country were neglecting many lifesaving treatments the journal also reported on another study that found that hospitals around boston and oklahoma city performed better than those in other regions , but that even in those places hundreds of patients did not get basic therapies a review of the data by the new york times showed that , as a group , hospitals in new jersey tended to perform better than those in new york , but not as well as hospitals in connecticut or massachusetts twentytwo of the state s 75 participating hospitals were in the top 10 percent of the nation in at least one of the conditions the hospital performance data are collected by the federal department of health and human services under a program called hospital compare and cover 10 treatments considered essential for most patients they include admissions from january to june 2004 detailed information is online at www hospitalcompare hhs gov we really should be close to 100 percent on all of these measures , said dr ashish jha , of the harvard school of public health , an author of one of the national studies published last month there s not much controversy about whether giving antibiotics to someone who has pneumonia is good or not besides aspirin for heart attack and antibiotics for pneumonia , the measures include beta blockers for heart attack , angiotensinconverting enzyme inhibitors for heart failure and heart attack , and vaccinations for pneumonia heart attack is an acute episode , usually requiring an emergency room visit , caused by constriction of flow in a coronary artery heart failure is a chronic condition , essentially the wearing out of the heart muscle to the point it cannot pump enough blood over all , new jersey hospitals delivered appropriate treatment to heart attack victims 94 percent of the time , to heart failure patients 89 percent of the time and to pneumonia patients 79 percent of the time , better than new york hospitals as a group , and above the national average the numbers also represent a significant improvement since 1998 , when an article in the journal of the american medical association put new jersey 41st in the nation in delivering these treatments to medicare patients on one of the indicators , making sure aspirin is administered for heart attack , we were doing that less than 50 percent of the time at one point , said aline holmes , director of the quality institute , an arm of the new jersey hospital association it s shown to reduce mortality , and we just have to do better last year , the state health department prodded hospitals into making improvements by producing its own report card , using these measures , and it appears to have helped for heart attack care , new jersey now ranks 21st you need a focused , almost surgical approach to the areas of the institution that have opportunities for improvement , said dr clifton lacy , the president of robert wood johnson university hospital in new brunswick and the former state health commissioner who championed the report cards his hospital ranks in the top 12 percent of all hospitals in the country in all three measures at hackensack university medical center , officials ripped up and rewrote their protocols of care to ensure that patients got the treatments we ended up changing the way we do business , said dr charles riccobono , chairman of the performance improvement department at hackensack for instance , pneumonia patients can show ambiguous symptoms that delay diagnosis , and thus delay delivery of antibiotics beyond a fourhour window in which they are proved to save more lives nurses and doctors were given a refresher course to increase their awareness of the potential for undiscovered pneumonia in patients antibiotic dispensing was moved from a central pharmacy to the emergency room to save minutes the result patients got the appropriate treatment 92 percent of the time , which put the hospital into the top 5 percent of hospitals nationwide doctors can be stubborn , dr riccobono said in order to get a uniform process , and take the variability out , you get them together , let them go over this stuff and eventually , they make it their own it s called physician buyin for heart attack patients , the usual practice was to allow primary care doctors to see a patient first , and allow them to decide when to call a cardiologist or notify the cardiac catheterization laboratory it became obvious that a more efficient way was to call the cardiologist and the cath lab immediately , dr riccobono said but while some hospitals have made strides , others have struggled some hospitals failed to deliver treatments a third of the time , meaning that your chances of surviving a heart attack , for instance , could vary significantly depending on where the ambulance takes you at christ hospital , a 402bed facility in jersey city , appropriate treatment for heart attack was given just 61 percent of the time the hospital has had financial difficulties , and has a new president , peter kelly , who was hired in january he said performance on the hospital compare measures had improved when institutions run into financial problems , the focus becomes the financial issue , and quality issues are not focused on as much as they should be , mr kelly said that is a mistake , he said , because hospitals with quality problems will not draw patients your financial success is now linked to your quality success , he said trinitas hospital in elizabeth ranked among the bottom third of the country in all three conditions , delivering the right care at the right time to heart attack patients 85 percent of the time , and to heart failure patients 74 percent of the time officials there said they were working to improve trinitas has made a major effort to streamline processes and reassign staff to ensure proper documentation , gary s horan , the hospital president , said in a statement doug harris , a spokesman at the hospital , said officials had found that some treatments were not documented they could very well have been done , but not documented , mr harris said but authorities said failure to document is a quality issue , too if there are lifesaving treatments the patients have received and you do n't document it in the chart , that s a failure as well , dr jha said if i'm treating the patient later , and i have no idea they received an important treatment , or did n't receive it for a reason , that s not good the measures cover a narrow band of the range of care the hospitals deliver , and state hospital officials stressed that there were many other ways to judge hospital quality dr jha s study showed that a hospital that did well treating one of the conditions did not necessarily do well treating another , so a hospital s overall quality would be better judged by a wider range of measures but , he said , these are common ailments , and the treatments are widely acknowledged to be necessary and crucial these are the bread and butter of medicine , dr jha said we know a tremendous amount about how to take care of these people we know that if you walk in with a heart attack and i give you an aspirin , your chances of surviving have improved dramatically and hospital officials said patients should not hesitate to use the ratings in choosing hospitals my big concern is that not enough patients utilize resources like this they choose by word of mouth , said dr lacy , the robert wood johnson university hospital president what we need is more comparative data of the kind that hospital compare provides dr jha agreed that patients should use the ratings to choose hospitals they can say , 'i am not going to hospital x and instead go to hospital y , ' he said if circumstances make it hard to go to another hospital , he said , they can ask their doctors and nurses and administrators , 'why are we not doing better \? '
rome , april 9 the roman catholic cardinals will take an oath of secrecy when they enter the conclave to elect the next pope , but in the week since john paul ii s death many have been publicly dropping hints about what kind of man the church now needs the enormous outpouring of affection for john paul has clearly had an impact on their thinking many of the prelates said in noticeably similar language that while the next pope may have a very different style than john paul , he must above all be an effective communicator of the faith who can sustain the grassroots enthusiasm , especially among youth , that john paul generated with all but 3 of the 117 cardinal electors selected by john paul , it is highly unlikely that the new pope will depart from his conservatism on contraception , divorce , women as priests or the range of what the church considers to be sanctity of life issues , from stem cell research to abortion and euthanasia before the pope s death , many cardinals and commentators said a decisive factor could be geography whether the next pope should come from europe , where the church is shrinking , or from latin america , africa or parts of asia , where the church is experiencing rapid growth but since the pope s death , the cardinals have said they are looking for someone who can project universal appeal with a personal humility and pastoral presence that embodies the message of the gospel , as they say john paul did it is not , many cardinals said in interviews , that they must choose a great orator he does n't have to be john paul ii and have the same fingerprints , said cardinal j francis stafford , formerly the archbishop of denver and now a highranking vatican official he just has to be his authentic self , cardinal stafford added and if they see he s authentic , that he s honest and they will see that that s all they need he will lead them to christ , and that s all that s necessary cardinal stafford and others spoke before saturday , when the vatican spokesman , joaqu n navarrovalls , announced that the cardinals had decided unanimously at their daily meeting to avoid interviews and contact with the media , whose members were invited to abstain from seeking out comment the cardinals have begun a period of more intense silence and prayer in the face of the conclave , he said the conclave begins on april 18 two cardinals cannot attend for health reasons , bringing the total count of electors to 115 , the vatican said saturday the men who will elect one of their own to be the leader of a church of more than a billion people are the most ethnically and geographically diverse college of cardinals in history , thanks to the effort by john paul to increase the number of nonitalians twentyone come from latin america , one of the world s fastestgrowing catholic zones , giving it one more than the traditional power , italy the united states and canada have 14 africa and asia each has 11 europe , where in some countries the church is hemorrhaging the faithful , has 58 the youngest is 52 years old the oldest turns 80 in june they fall into two groups those who work in the vatican curia , carrying out the business of the church , and those who serve as archbishops , tending to catholics on the local level aside from age and geography , they also have different priorities for the next pope to emphasize as he carries out his public ministry one is the need to continue forging closer ties with other religions and other christian denominations many cardinals emphasized last week the need for increased dialogue with muslim leaders you do n't want a clash of religions , said cardinal avery dulles , a theology professor at fordham university and a nonvoter he identified ecumenism as one of two priorities for the next pope along with pushing forward with john paul s effort to evangelize in the west several cardinals have indicated a strong desire for someone with the pastoral qualities of cardinals who are also archbishops i would hope his focus would be on local communities of faith , cardinal edward m egan of new york said the parish is the central unit that must be served more than at any past conclave the closed door meeting in the sistine chapel where the cardinals will vote this one has an unusually large number of papabili , the italian word to describe those with pope potential the cardinals are loath to mention names , but from the comments of many , the field seems to be wide open but by describing the qualities they desire , educated guesses can be made about serious contenders , always with the oftenrepeated caveat about conclaves , go in a pope , come out a cardinal one man who fits many of the current criteria is cardinal dionigi tettamanzi , 71 , the archbishop of milan he reminds many italian catholics of an earlier muchbeloved pope , john xxiii , with his plump appearance and his warmth he is a son of the working class , and spoke in support of antiglobalization protesters in 2001 at the meeting of major industrialized nations in genoa , where he told the thousands of demonstrators , one african child sick with aids counts more than the entire universe he is also a conservative intellectual , close to opus dei , who is said to have helped john paul write several key encyclicals he has published a book on bioethics , an expertise that would be crucial for the next pope another whose name is often mentioned is claudio hummes , the archbishop of s o paulo who speaks five languages and looks much younger than his 70 years brazil has the largest number of catholics of any country , but the church is facing a serious challenge from the protestant evangelical movement as a bishop early on , he opposed brazil s military government and backed striking workers since then , he has grown more conservative and once chastised a priest for suggesting that condoms should be used to fight aids even before the conclave , candidacies will be pushed by what are known among vatican watchers as grand electors influential cardinals who can sway votes or at the least are looked to for guidance they tend to be prominent members of vatican congregations where they meet other cardinals , or frequent travelers , or men who by sheer force of intellect and personality are given weight some of them are even papabili themselves the issues on the minds of catholics who would like to see their church liberalize its position on contraception , divorce or women priests are not under discussion , the cardinals said in interviews this does not preclude the possibility that the next pope could eventually lead the church to adopt some new interpretation on church traditions , but where the issue is considered a matter of doctrine it is highly unlikely to change for instance , the church s ban on artificial contraception was reinforced by pope paul vi in his encyclical humanae vitae a reporter asked cardinal francis george of chicago in a news conference last week whether the church would consider approving the use of condoms to prevent aids in places like africa your solution is to exterminate the poor \? he said , referring to the births that contraception would prevent the doctrine of the church is n't going to change , and so you work with it as best as you can despite the growing consensus that they need a communicator , there is always a chance that other factors will significantly sway the cardinals' choice they may opt for an older interim figure , someone who would help the church pause for breath in the aftermath of one of history s longest and most eventful papacies a candidate for that role would be cardinal joseph ratzinger , who worked closely with john paul for 24 years as the chief overseer of church theology and is deeply respected for his learning and decisiveness he is also the dean of the cardinals , effectively their chairman and guiding force , and is one of only three cardinal electors who have ever attended a conclave but age may hurt cardinal ratzinger turns 78 on saturday this is a very strong personality , of great intelligence , faith and openness , cardinal zenon grocholewski told reuters the problem is his advanced age perhaps a young , vigorous man would be attractive , after so many years of the world seeing an increasingly ailing john paul the viennese archbishop , christoph sch nborn , 60 , fits that bill he is the fourth youngest of the cardinals , widely respected for being learned and articulate the scion of an aristocratic family with numerous clerical members over the centuries , cardinal sch nborn is wellthought of for how he handled the sex scandals that shamed his predecessor but some fault him for showing coldness in handling his staff and for reacting poorly to a dispute with another austrian bishop he belongs to the dominican religious order then there is region should he come from a developing country \? perhaps , this line of reasoning goes , the timing would be perfect for a pope to address poverty , just as the cold war demanded a karol wojtyla i believe the holy spirit will give us the pope we need at this time , like he did 26 years ago , when john paul ii was elected , cardinal theodore mccarrick of washington said francis arinze , 72 , of nigeria , who is also heavily involved in relations with muslims , is a perennial favorite cardinal arinze has been a vatican official for 20 years , and is head of the department regulating worship and the sacramental practice he converted to catholicism at the age of 9 while his spiritual credentials are strong , critics have said he lacks imagination his language can be strong a year ago he said that a roman catholic politician who supports abortion is not fit to receive communion , and he has criticized homosexuality as having mocked the family perhaps none of this matters , some cardinals suggested , returning to the charisma issue if they ever needed proof of the power of a single figure to inspire catholics , particularly young ones , they had it last week the image of the crowds that came to mourn john paul an estimated 14 million filed by the pope s body among the roughly three million who descended on rome is prompting the cardinals to wonder how to sustain and deepen that enthusiasm and even translate it into a reinvigorated church he has to be able to communicate with rich , young people in countries like the united states and france , said cardinal philippe barbarin of france then he needs to be able to relate to the poor when he goes to places like brazil or morocco or burkina faso he has to be a person who can explain the gospels to every type of audience he has to really love his flock he has to understand their sufferings , their difficulties , he said john paul ii was that kind of pope
boston , jan 19 federal law enforcement officials said wednesday that they were searching for four chinese citizens who may have been involved in plotting a possible terrorist action in boston michael j sullivan , the united states attorney for massachusetts , and kenneth kaiser , the special agent in charge of the fbi s boston office , said in a statement that the authorities had received a tip that was uncorroborated and of unknown reliability about such a plot they released the names and photographs of two chinese men and two chinese women whom they were looking to bring in for questioning the statement said that none of the four zengrong lin , wen quin zheng , xiujin chen and guozhi lin were on any previously existing watch list federal law enforcement officials said they were not raising the terror alert status in boston the authorities were informed about the four in a tip from a single anonymous source , said mayor thomas m menino the tip , apparently received by federal officials in california , suggested that the four might have entered the united sates recently from mexico gov mitt romney said wednesday evening that the four were believed to have been dropped off in new york and that they might have been heading to boston but that none of them were believed to be in massachusetts as of wednesday evening local news coverage of the reported threats prompted mr romney , who was in washington to attend the inauguration of president bush on thursday , to return to massachusetts on wednesday night he said he wanted to assure people that it s safe to be in boston gov john lynch of new hampshire also returned from washington mr menino sought to dispel news reports about the possibility of a dirty bomb or a plot to attack a liquified natural gas tanker in the city s harbor , and federal officials called the tip typical of the kind of fragmentary and unsubstantiated information that federal authorities routinely check out , but rarely find significant there s been much misinformation circulating , mr menino said federal authorities in washington said the information referred to the boston fbi was uncorroborated and lacked enough specifics to amount to a discernible threat they said that they were examining the activities of the four people but that there was no evidence to believe that any of them were dangerous peter judge , a spokesman for the massachusetts emergency management agency , said the state s emergency operations center was activated on a limited basis wednesday afternoon

washington , may 25 when the senate asked justice priscilla r owen for the most significant opinions she had written on the texas supreme court , she provided a list with a distinctive theme tough she chose opinions overturning rulings in favor of a child born with birth defects , a worker injured on an oil rig , a nurse fired for blowing the whistle on a drugdealing coworker , a family with an interest in an oil field that had been drained by a nearby company , asbestos and breastimplant plaintiffs and a student whose school made him cut his hair she represents a part of the texas culture that is basically a frontier mentality , said linda s eads , a law professor at southern methodist university and a former deputy attorney general of texas who supports ms owen s nomination you do n't cry about your hardships , you just keep moving forward , professor eads said in some ways , it s a very empowering philosophy , and in some ways it can be seen as cold i guess it depends on which side of the outcome you are after four years in the crossfire of partisan battle over her nomination to the federal bench denounced by liberal critics as extremist and callous , hailed by conservatives as a kindhearted sunday school teacher who lifted herself up from humble roots ms owen finally won senate confirmation wednesday on a 55to43 vote to the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit , in new orleans after senate democrats allowed her confirmation to break a stalemate over judicial nominations , her conservative supporters argued that her confirmation set a benchmark judges with records and views like ms owen s , her supporters argue , can no longer be construed as objectionable they note that none of her opinions have been overturned her confirmation is unlikely to change the balance of the fifth circuit , which is already dominated by republicans but for ms owen , who declined to be interviewed , it is the latest reward of a partnership that began a dozen years ago when a prominent texas conservative introduced her to karl rove , who was at the time a political consultant and emerging kingmaker karl came over and visited with her at length , and he was very impressed , said ralph wayne , president of the texas civil justice league , who was recruiting conservatives to run for the texas supreme court in an effort to move it to the right if you just wrote down her r sum and had it before you , it is kind of in the matrix that you look for , mr wayne said it was a r sum brimming with selfreliance priscilla richman was born in 1954 in palacios , tex , while her father was in the military in korea just 15 months later , after returning home , he died of polio ms owen spent her first five years on her maternal grandparents' rice farm near collegeport , tex even after her mother remarried , to an insurance salesman , and the family moved to waco , ms owen spent her vacations working on the rice farm and on her paternal grandfather s cattle ranch in palacios he gave her her work ethic , her sister , nancy lacy , said in an interview he knew that there was a possibility that she was going to be alone , so from a very young age he always talked to her about working hard , supporting herself , saving money she needed to know how to take care of herself because her father was no longer there she earned her bachelor s and law degrees at baylor university and married her high school sweetheart , who became an accountant but their careers took a toll on their marriage , and it ended in divorce , ms lacy said they had no children they were both very hardworking , very dedicated people , she said they are still mutual friends ms owen represented mostly oil and gas companies she quickly gained a reputation as a formidable litigator , and the texas firm of andrews kurth made her a partner by the time she was 30 her private life showed a softer side she cherished her two belgian sheep dogs and served on the board of texas hearing and service dogs , which trains unwanted dogs mr rove managed ms owen s republican candidacy for the texas supreme court in 1994 , and she often campaigned with george w bush , another rove client , who was running for governor ms owen , mr bush and mr rove became close friends each year , ms owen cooked a dinner of quail a texas specialty , for mr bush , laura bush and other judges on the court , usually at mr rove s home , said justice nathan hecht , a conservative ally of ms owen on the bench in more recent years , ms owen also became much more religious , her sister said republicans have lauded her role as a founding member of st barnabas church , a theologically conservative congregation in austin where she still teaches sunday school on any given sunday , you can find justice owen hopping on one leg , reading stories , senator kay bailey hutchison of texas said last week democrats have criticized an allusion to religion in an opinion she wrote arguing against exempting a teenager seeking an abortion from the state s parental notification law the law s requirement of an informed decision , ms owen argued , included an understanding that some women have experienced severe remorse and regret and consideration that there are philosophic , social , moral and religious arguments about abortion , as well ms owen s defenders argue that she was interpreting an ambiguous law in a way consistent with its legislative history and that courts later cleared up its meaning and her pastor , the rev jeff black , said she would never impose her religious views in a court if it was a believer who came to her and said , 'what should i do \? ' then she would say , 'here is what the scripture says , ' mr black said but in a court of law , she would never do that
i'm not sure if paula vogel s hot 'n' throbbing is a comedy about domestic abuse or a tragedy about the effects of pornography , but the fact that a good argument could be made for either \( or both \) says something about the ambitions of this curious , clever and often frustrating jumble of a play hot 'n' throbbing completes signature theater company s season , dedicated to the formidable career of ms vogel , who has often tackled charged social issues \( pedophilia , aids , prostitution \) in theatrical and provocatively skewed ways while this kind of daring has resulted in some triumphs like the pulitzer prizewinning how i learned to drive and last season s off broadway drama the long christmas ride home it also has potential pitfalls , some of which are prominently on display in les waters s offkey production at first the play resembles a highconcept sitcom inside a suburban washington house there s a scantily clad teenage daughter , leslie ann \( suli holum \) , who is growing up too fast her brainy brother , calvin \( matthew stadelmann \) , with a voyeuristic streak and a bedraggled mom , charlene \( lisa emery \) , struggling to maintain family values while paying the bills by writing adult film screenplays it s easy to imagine a television executive pitching the scene where the son helps his mother come up with a synonym for throbbing but the broadly comic tone disappears when charlene s drunken exhusband , clyde \( elias koteas \) , arrives an uneducated brute with a hairtrigger temper , he barges in the front door making violent advances to his former wife then charlene takes out a gun and shoots him and that s when things begin to get romantic yes , romantic things like bullet wounds and dead bodies are easily glossed over in this headspinningly absurd play and jarring shifts in tone are only one of the ways the play calls attention to itself working in the language of film , ms vogel fast forwards during scenes \( jump cut !

washington , july 20 the senate judiciary committee gave a generally positive reception on wednesday to proposed legislation that would protect journalists from having to divulge confidential sources in most cases but a harshly worded dissent from the justice department , which called the bill bad public policy that would hamper its ability to enforce the law and fight terrorism , underscored the difficult road the legislation faces in becoming law the nearly twoandahalfhour hearing , held before a standingroomonly crowd , included testimony in favor of a shield law for the news media from nine elected representatives , lawyers and journalists , including matthew cooper , the time magazine reporter who narrowly avoided going to jail after being swept up in a special prosecutor s investigation into the disclosure by administration officials of a cia operative s identity another reporter , judith miller of the new york times , is in jail for refusing to reveal her confidential sources in the same investigation these highprofile cases have helped thrust the issue of reporters' use of confidential sources into the limelight in cases where confidential sources are not involved , the proposed legislation would require that federal prosecutors and courts show that the information sought was critical to the case and could not be obtained elsewhere the witnesses echoed one another on wednesday , arguing that the shield law s purpose was not to bestow preferential treatment on journalists but to ensure that the public gets the information it needs to make informed decisions about the government compelling reporters to testify and , in particular , forcing them to reveal the identity of their confidential sources without extraordinary circumstances , hurts the public interest , said senator richard g lugar , republican of indiana and the bill s senate sponsor , in his testimony the result will be that many whistleblowers will refuse to come forward and reporters will be unable to provide our constituents with information they have a right to know norman pearlstine , editor in chief of time inc , said in his testimony that his decision to obey the courts and hand over mr cooper s notes and documents to the special prosecutor which he said he did reluctantly after fighting the edict all the way to the supreme court has already resulted in several valuable confidential sources refusing to cooperate again with time magazine although 31 states and the district of columbia provide shield laws and an additional 18 state courts have established protections for reporters in many federal courts there are virtually no protections in addition , while justice department guidelines limit subpoenas to the news media , they do not necessarily apply to special prosecutors and do not deal with other federal agencies or civil litigation the smorgasbord of differing rules leaves journalists confused about what legal protections they can rely on representative mike pence , republican of indiana , who is shepherding the bill through the house , also testified wednesday he said that in the last year nine journalists have been handed or threatened with jail sentences , and a dozen or so more have been questioned by prosecutors or served with subpoenas as a conservative , i believe the founding fathers thought the only check on government power in real time was a free and independent press , mr pence , a former radio show host , said in an interview tuesday but the justice department found the proposed legislation too farreaching james b comey , deputy attorney general , said in a statement , the bill is bad public policy primarily because it would bar the government from obtaining information about media sources even in the most urgent of circumstances affecting the public s health or safety or national security the bill would seriously jeopardize traditional notions of grand jury secrecy and unnecessarily delay the completion of criminal investigations , mr comey added to address concerns in congress and the justice department , both the senate and the identical house bill were recently revised to carve out an exception for national security issues mr comey s statement surprised a number of the witnesses lee levine , a lawyer at levine sullivan koch schulz who has represented news organizations , said much of the justice department s statement addressed issues already dealt with in the revised bill , namely national security the revised bill introduced an exception saying that a federal entity cannot compel a journalist to divulge a confidential source unless disclosure of the identity of such a source is necessary to prevent imminent and actual harm to national security a justice department spokesman said mr comey s statement was delivered to the judiciary committee by its deadline , and the bill was revised after that the spokesman declined to comment on whether the revisions satisfied the department s concerns despite the inclusion of the national security exemption , some members of the judiciary committee expressed concerns that it provided journalists with too much protection this would mean , basically , there s no ability to compel anything , said senator dianne feinstein , democrat of california from 1973 to 1978 , there were 99 legislative attempts at a federal shield law , according to lucy dalglish , executive director of the reporters committee for the freedom of the press none passed the bills in the senate and house will not find their journey that much easier norman j ornstein , a resident scholar at the american enterprise institute , a washington research organization , said that while there was bipartisan support for the bill , he did

portland , me , may 11 the woods behind the sisters of mercy convent where sister joyce mahany has prayed since she joined the order in 1950 have disappeared gone are the stone grotto near which she said rosaries and the statue of st bernadette , where sister joyce would often stand in silent reflection she still chokes up when she talks about the woods , with its stations of the cross and benches for reflection , but sister joyce has come to terms with the nowbarren land , which , when it is flattened , sodded and groomed , will serve a secular purpose the six acres will be transformed into athletic fields for mccauley high , the girls school that the order operates next to its portland residence it s very emotional for me to see the statues gone , as well as the places where i prayed , sister joyce said but that sorrow will be turned to joy when i see the kids out there the sisters of mercy voted three years ago to donate their outdoor worship space to the 274 students , more than half of whom play sports work on the grounds started may 1 those who play field sports soccer , lacrosse , field hockey , softball , and track and field have long lamented about the school s single playing field , which overlapped with its only softball diamond opposing teams hounded mccauley players about the conditions , students said , and many practice sessions and games were held wherever the school could find space , usually in portland city parks , at a nearby university or on the school s small front lawn mccauley s inadequate facilities and ragtag space arrangements , combined with an increased interest in field sports , made the nuns realize that the students might need the space more than they did after numerous meetings among a planning committee and 25 sisters none of whom openly objected to the plan the order formally donated the land , which sits behind the high school and the convent the city of portland approved the 600 , 000 project in 2002 the sisters , whose order has a tradition of educating women , said that letting go of the space was part of their mission it fits in with our commitment to educating young ladies and giving them every opportunity we can , said sister mary morey , who joined the order in 1960 as sisters we are very committed to the school , and we realized how key this is to the program at the school while they are committed to the field of dreams , as it has been called , the sisters , all of whom took their vows decades ago and are unlikely to use the athletic facilities , find the project bittersweet sister joyce , who has lived at the convent on and off for her 55 years , would pray in the woods every day , except when the weather was bad sister mary found spiritual solace among the trees , as did the school s principal , sister edward mary kelleher alumnae like eileen veroneau brown , who graduated from the school in 1983 and now works there , have fond memories of watching the sisters walk amid the trees and stop in front of the statues , which are now covered with tarps and stored under a tree behind the convent the icons will most likely be dispersed throughout the campus grounds once the field is complete but with so many students involved in athletics , building new fields was a guaranteed way to plan for the school s future and attract new students i see extracurricular athletics as key to the development of the students , sister edward mary said being on a team builds leadership , and that is key for them we want to make sure all of these things are available to our students , that we 're not depriving them the new grounds will be complete late this year , but the first games will not be held until september 2006 to allow the turf to settle it s going to be nice to be able to walk outside and play , said rory nickerson , 16 , a sophomore on the lacrosse team the school has come to realize , however , that it takes a lot more than faith to finish the project , which is being financed almost entirely through donations about half the cost has been paid , and the nuns are starting a fundraising campaign , hoping to tap community groups and leaders as well as alumnae for donations the students seem especially grateful to the order jessamyn perkins , 17 , a senior who plays lacrosse , wrote a column in a local newspaper last week , thanking the sisters for donating the land although ms perkins will not play on the field , she plans to watch the team compete when she is on break from howard university it really means a lot to me , ms perkins said they did this so girls can have better athletic fields it shows an amount of generosity that s inconceivable to a lot of people
tokyo , oct 10 deep in the australian outback , a japanese team took a small step forward on monday in its plan to build a supersonic commercial jet the engineers , backed by the japanese government and several companies , flew a small , unmanned model of a supersonic jetliner in woomera , south australia a model of the jet , 115 meters long , or about 38 feet , and resembling an arrow with its sweptback wings and long , sleek body , took off attached to a solidfuel rocket the model reached an altitude of 19 kilometers , or 12 miles , before floating back by parachute , according to the japan aerospace exploration agency , which heads development of the supersonic jet the engineless model reached a speed of mach 2 , or about 1 , 500 miles per hour kenichi saito , a spokesman for the agency , said the unmanned test flight went as planned , the associated press reported from sydney everything was very good and the aircraft landed also normally , mr saito said we are going to conduct the analysis , but currently we think this flight was a success the project has had little support from the aerospace industry and none from airlines or major aircraft manufacturers its budget is tiny compared with most other aerospace projects , and any hope for a fullsize plane is far in the future but the japanese persist in hoping that the project someday will propel their nation to the front ranks of the global aircraft industry takaaki akuto , another spokesman for the japan aerospace exploration agency , said the agency hoped to have an actual jet flying by 2025 , although it was unclear where the money or the orders would come from the plan calls for the jet to carry 300 passengers at speeds of up to mach 24 , fast enough to cut the current flight time from tokyo to new york to 6 hours from 12 the agency says it hopes that the jet will become the successor to the french and britishbuilt concorde , the first supersonic commercial jet , which ceased flying two years ago after a fatal crash and losses of billions of dollars the purpose is to show the world that japan can take a leading role in developing new aircraft , mr akuto said until now , japan has been a secondary player behind companies like boeing and airbus three years ago , a similar test ended in failure when the unmanned aircraft detached prematurely from the rocket and slammed into the desert the agency leads a consortium of government research labs and private companies , including the biggest aerospace companies in japan mitsubishi heavy industries , kawasaki heavy industries and ishikawajimaharima heavy industries in june , japanese and french industry groups signed a threeyear agreement to conduct joint research into new technologies for supersonic flight , looking , for instance , at ways to reduce engine noise and to develop light composite materials capable of resisting extreme pressures the french were not involved in the flight on monday , according to the agency to succeed , the jet would have to overcome a host of problems that plagued the concorde and that persuaded more established players like boeing to give up plans to build a supersonic successor these include noise , pollution and the high cost of flying beyond the sound barrier , which consumes far more fuel than normal commercial flight japan s space agency says that more advanced engines will produce a quarter the amount of nitrogen oxide , a pollutant , and be no louder than conventional jumbo jets the concorde was taken out of service in 2003 after the crash in the paris area in 2000 that killed 113 people the jet failed to earn back the billions of dollars that the british and french governments had invested in it
kaifeng , china as this millennium dawns , new york city is the most important city in the world , the unofficial capital of planet earth but before we new yorkers become too full of ourselves , it might be worthwhile to glance at dilapidated kaifeng in central china kaifeng , an ancient city along the mudclogged yellow river , was by far the most important place in the world in 1000 and if you 've never heard of it , that s a useful warning for americans as the chinese headline above puts it , in a language of the future that many more americans should start learning , glory is as ephemeral as smoke and clouds as the world s only superpower , america may look today as if global domination is an entitlement but if you look back at the sweep of history , it s striking how fleeting supremacy is , particularly for individual cities my vote for most important city in the world in the period leading up to 2000 bc would be ur , iraq in 1500 bc , perhaps thebes , egypt there was no dominant player in 1000 bc , though one could make a case for sidon , lebanon in 500 bc , it would be persepolis , persia in the year 1 , rome around ad 500 , maybe changan , china in 1000 , kaifeng , china in 1500 , probably florence , italy in 2000 , new york city and in 2500 , probably none of the above today kaifeng is grimy and poor , not even the provincial capital and so minor it lacks even an airport its sad state only underscores how fortunes change in the 11th century , when it was the capital of song dynasty china , its population was more than one million in contrast , london s population then was about 15 , 000 an ancient 17foot painted scroll , now in the palace museum in beijing , shows the bustle and prosperity of ancient kaifeng hundreds of pedestrians jostle each other on the streets , camels carry merchandise in from the silk road , and teahouses and restaurants do a thriving business kaifeng s stature attracted people from all over the world , including hundreds of jews even today , there are some people in kaifeng who look like other chinese but who consider themselves jewish and do not eat pork as i roamed the kaifeng area , asking local people why such an international center had sunk so low , i encountered plenty of envy of new york one man said he was arranging to be smuggled into the us illegally , by paying a gang 25 , 000 , but many local people insisted that china is on course to bounce back and recover its historic role as world leader china is booming now , said wang ruina , a young peasant woman on the outskirts of town give us a few decades and we 'll catch up with the us , even pass it she s right the us has had the biggest economy in the world for more than a century , but most projections show that china will surpass us in about 15 years , as measured by purchasing power parity so what can new york learn from a city like kaifeng \? one lesson is the importance of sustaining a technological edge and sound economic policies ancient china flourished partly because of progrowth , protrade policies and technological innovations like curved iron plows , printing and paper money but then china came to scorn trade and commerce , and per capita income stagnated for 600 years a second lesson is the danger of hubris , for china concluded it had nothing to learn from the rest of the world and that was the beginning of the end i worry about the us in both regards our economic management is so lax that we ca n't confront farm subsidies or longterm budget deficits our technology is strong , but american public schools are secondrate in math and science and americans' lack of interest in the world contrasts with the restlessness , drive and determination that are again pushing china to the forefront beside the yellow river i met a 70yearold peasant named hao wang , who had never gone to a day of school he could n't even write his name and yet his progeny were different two of my grandsons are now in university , he boasted , and then he started talking about the computer in his home thinking of kaifeng should stimulate us to struggle to improve our hightech edge , educational strengths and progrowth policies for if we rest on our laurels , even a city as great as new york may end up as kaifengonthehudson oped columnist email nicholas nytimescom
perhaps no minor party has shaped modernday politics in new york as profoundly as the state s conservative party , sending a littleknown candidate to the united states senate in 1970 and helping orchestrate the defeat of a democratic star , gov mario m cuomo , a generation later but now , with the steady erosion of its base of power over the last decade , the party faces the grim prospect of going the way of the brooklyn dodgers , the new york herald tribune and the subway token in one of the more intriguing plots of the 2006 political season , the conservative party is at risk of losing its place on the statewide ballot next year , political analysts say , and some republicans are questioning the value of their longtime alliance with conservatives at a time that tensions between the two parties are high under state law , a party s candidate for governor must draw at least 50 , 000 votes to ensure that the party has a place on the ballot for the next four years but political analysts say that it is an open question whether the conservative party can do that , given its dwindling enrollment , disenchantment within its ranks and infighting among some of its leaders in the 2002 election for governor , for example , the conservative party had a remarkably weak showing , drawing 176 , 848 votes , about onefifth of the 827 , 614 votes it collected in 1990 , according to results compiled by the state board of elections party leaders have to be very worried about survival , said lee m miringoff , director of the marist college institute for public opinion he recalled the fate of new york s liberal party in 2002 , when it lost its place on the ballot after a halfcentury of existence even if the conservative party manages to get the 50 , 000 votes it needs to remain on the ballot , it faces the strong possibility that it will tumble to a lower spot on the ballot if it draws a relatively small number of votes on election day 2006 because ballot positions are assigned according to a party s vote totals in the governor s race in 1998 , for example , the conservative party lost the third line on the ballot , line c , to the upstart independence party and has not been able to recover that coveted position since the third ballot line is the highest spot for a third party , behind the republicans and democrats , and so is easier for voters to notice than lower ballot lines i have deep concerns about the longevity and future of the conservative party , said richard stack , the chairman of the albany county conservative party the party might end up on line g and you know what g stands for \? gone michael r long , the chairman of the conservative party , acknowledged a need to rally rankandfile conservatives , though he said he did not see the situation as dire as some describe the stakes are high , he said but i do n't necessarily fear us going out of business the situation has implications beyond the fate of the conservative party in an apparent effort to mobilize their party s base , leading conservatives in the state are sharply criticizing republicans party leaders , as republicans try to field a slate of politically moderate candidates to compete next year in heavily democratic new york in particular , republican leaders are championing jeanine f pirro , the westchester county district attorney , to run for the senate and william f weld , the former massachusetts governor , to run for governor but their support for abortion rights and gay rights has alienated some conservative leaders , who have indicated that they may run their own candidates for governor and for the senate if republicans do not select candidates with more rightleaning ideologies mr long said he is far more interested in making an ideological statement that would resonate with his party than he is in simply winning we are not just in it to win elections no matter who the candidate is , he said we are in it to win elections with likeminded conservative candidates if conservatives break with republicans in 2006 , the implications could be significant , political analysts say minor parties can often provide margins of victory to majorparty candidates when races are close that was the case in the 1994 race for governor , when the conservative party line made the difference in george e pataki s victory over mr cuomo republicans are outraged at the criticisms being leveled by conservative leaders , including mr long many republicans say the conservative party s attempt to influence , if not dictate , the republican party s political lineup for 2006 is a classic case of the tail trying to wag the dog one highranking republican official , who insisted on anonymity because he did not want to inflame tension between the two parties , said that the conservative party s political clout had diminished so greatly that republican candidates would be better served with the independence party line instead the republican party does n't need to be beholden to the conservative party anymore , the official said several republicans have even asserted that conservative party leaders would be spiting themselves by running their own candidate for governor and thereby inviting the possibility of failing to get the 50 , 000 votes needed to keep the party s line on the ballot but conservatives note that there is evidence that their party is better able to excite its supporters when it picks its own candidate in 1990 , for example , herbert london , running as a conservative , had nearly as many votes as the republican nominee for governor , pierre rinfret mr cuomo , then the governor , was reelected that year with 22 million votes on the democratic and liberal lines , to about 865 , 000 for mr rinfret and 828 , 000 for mr london in a sense , the conservative party has been a victim of its own success since 1994 , when it entered into a pivotal alliance with new york republicans to support mr pataki mr cuomo had 24 million votes on the democratic and liberal lines mr pataki , who had 22 million votes on the republican line , was lifted to victory with the roughly 329 , 000 votes he received on the conservative line but the republicanconservative coalition that was cemented in 1994 eventually became a source of dismay among conservatives even as the conservative party endorsed mr pataki in his two subsequent reelections , in 1998 and 2002 , he moved to the left ideologically , adopting democratic positions in order to remain politically viable in an increasingly democratic state today , many conservatives point to the years of support that party leaders provided to mr pataki as one of the main reasons for disaffection in the party ranks the party has also lost enrollment in recent years , with 155 , 000 registered members this month , compared with 173 , 905 in november 2000 , according to the board of elections james brewster , vice chairman of the conservative party , said one reason the conservative line on the ballot had such a weak showing in 2002 was that the candidate was none other than mr pataki , who moved toward the middle politically in his later runs for governor mr brewster said part of the grass roots of the conservative party did n't go out to vote because mr pataki was at the top of the ticket and if they did go out to vote , they did n't vote for the governor , he said they did n't vote for george pataki because he moved to the left too far mr brewster said it would be a mistake for the party to endorse another liberalleaning republican we 're not going to energize our base with a weld , he said the party s circumstances are a far cry from its standing in 1970 , when james buckley was elected to the united states senate on the conservative line with more than two million votes these days , some in conservative circles believe that the party must be open to moderate republican candidates who may differ with conservatives on some matters but who are viable as candidates in a largely democratic state they have to learn to compromise a little bit , said mr stack , the albany conservative chairman , referring to party leaders their refusal to compromise is leading them to select candidates who are unelectable
jerome williams has left the basketball court , but the selfstyled junk yard dog will be heard barking messages of good will across new york for at least a few more years waived by the knicks earlier in the week , williams announced yesterday that he was retiring as a player to take a multifaceted job with the organization williams s exuberance and unflagging optimism will be channeled into community relations , television and scouting but the clear emphasis will be on the community work , which the 32yearold williams made a high priority throughout his nineyear nba career i thought it was just an opportunity for me to go ahead and hang up the shoes and get involved with a lot of the things that i'm already involved with , in terms of giving back to the community , he said the knicks saved 213 million in luxurytax payments by cutting williams under the league s amnesty clause the actual amount due williams , who had three years left on his contract , is about 19 million williams could have collected that sum and resumed his career with another team , perhaps for another million dollars or so but , he noted i'm a little bit of a different breed it does n't work for me that simply during his year in new york , williams initiated a number of youth programs , and he said it was important to follow through on that work i'm still getting paid by the knicks , he said i'm feeling a little obligated to not only carry out what i promised to those kids , but also still working for my money through his foundation , the jyd project , and with support from the knicks , williams and his brother johnnie have put on a number of motivational events urging youngsters of all ages to stay in school , devote themselves to their studies and prepare for college they have so far taken their message through brooklyn , the bronx , yonkers and harlem i told a lot of kids i was going to be back , williams said he could have been back wearing a knicks jersey despite knee and foot ailments that slowed him last spring , williams said he was capable of continuing his career as a hustling , hardcharging forward none of his injuries required surgery , he said williams played in 79 games last season , averaging 45 points and 36 rebounds in 153 minutes a game everyone knows i can still contribute to a team , he said i'm not limping away i'm able to step into training camp right now and beat out at least 65 percent of the guys on any roster williams met with isiah thomas , the team president , yesterday morning to talk about his new duties he will also work as a commentator for msg network and expects to do some scouting williams is producing his second motivational rap album , due out this fall , and said he has a few movie offers but his longterm goals remain in basketball he hopes to eventually run a franchise the only thing i leave the game regretting is the fact i did n't dunk on shaq , he said you can tell him i said it
greenburgh , ny , jan 20 forward kurt thomas was asked after a tough practice thursday to pinpoint one or two reasons the knicks do not win much anymore it s more than just one or two things , thomas said so how many reasons are there \? i ca n't count that high , he said that drew a big laugh from the reporters and photographers surrounding thomas , who smiled welcome to the gallows humor segment of the season , in which the knicks feel they could end their slump with a victory , if only they were good enough to get one the knicks \( 1721 \) , who have lost eight of their last nine games , play their next four at home , including friday s game against the houston rockets , who are led by the former knicks coach jeff van gundy but none of the knicks' next four opponents are in a tailspin , as they are although coach lenny wilkens said thursday that he had not run out of possible solutions , a glaze seems to have settled over the knicks point guard stephon marbury even lost track thursday of who was on the roster marbury was asked about the recent signing of rod strickland , who is , like marbury , a new york native and is a point guard whom marbury has admired since he was growing up in brooklyn on our team \? marbury said no , marbury was told strickland signed thursday with the rockets i did n't hear about that , he said the knicks have been reported to be looking into a deal that would send thomas and the injured guard penny hardaway to the toronto raptors for forward donyell marshall and guard jalen rose , who scored 24 points against the knicks in a 9881 victory wednesday no one changed teams thursday the knicks , though , seemed to agree that the current roster was capable of winning if many of the players had not been injured the knicks have been unable to establish an identity everybody s worried about identity , wilkens said we 're worried about winning wilkens s message seems to have stayed the same we are close toronto outscored the knicks in the fourth quarter , 3820 , but wilkens looked at the film and counted only two defensive breakdowns in the quarter the other times , we rotated and had a hand up , wilkens said they made some tough shots as the knicks fell apart in the fourth quarter , wilkens tried several lineup combinations as a way , he said , to get something going it was one of those times that it did n't work , he said thursday wilkens tried to stress to his team that the fourth quarter was not as bad as it might have seemed marbury said the knicks played good defense but could not score enough to outlast the raptors rose simply had a great game when a guy gets going like that , he s tough to stop , knicks guard jamal crawford said thomas said we were right there we could n't get the stop we needed thomas , a nineyear veteran , said it was difficult for a team with so many new faces to jell in half a season then came the injuries on wednesday , for the first time since dec 22 , the knicks used the starting five they had used in their first 26 games we either struggle offensively , or we struggle defensively , thomas said crawford has made only 7 of 28 fieldgoal attempts since he returned monday from a sprained right toe , but he said he was concentrating more on what he needed to do to help the team win just one game we know that once we win one game , we can get it rolling , he said the knicks also thought they could get it rolling after they beat portland , 113105 , on jan 9 to end a fourgame losing streak and even their record at 1717 but they have lost four games since , and a rugged fivegame trip awaits after these four home games it does have to stop , period , marbury said of the losing we ca n't allow ourselves to fall into the pattern of losing the knicks already seem to be in that pattern that may be why wilkens is so eager to see crawford and tim thomas , who has also been injured , up to speed if you focus together , you can turn it around quicker , wilkens said , and he seemed to be referring to the players already on the roster

to the editor the debate about where incarcerated people live should not ignore the racial impact of the current practice of allowing prisoners to be counted in the census on the basis of where they are incarcerated \( editorial , sept 26 \) inmates do not have the right to vote in the largely white rural areas where large correctional facilities are located they also receive none of the federal aid that a locale receives on the basis of the census blacks and latinos make up a disproportionately large segment of the prison population in new york prisons , most inmates were residents of seven new york city neighborhoods before their incarceration sadly , the poor neighborhoods send residents to distant areas where they are used to help create districts that elect representatives who then vote against the interest of those neighborhoods the resemblance between this system and early america under slavery , when a slave counted as threefifths of a person for census purposes but had no rights whatsoever , is undeniable roland nicholson jr chairman , the fortune society new york , sept 27 , 2005
a road trip that started with such promise for the yankees has turned sour at angel stadium the yankees lost here for the third game in a row saturday night , 86 to the los angeles angels , on a night when their offense could not make up for kevin brown s dismal start derek jeter , who had been 6 for 39 in the second half of the season , had four hits , including a homer robinson cano and jason giambi also went deep it was not enough , because the angels punished brown for seven runs over three and a third innings vladimir guerrero , who hit a grand slam to win thursday s game , smashed a threerun homer off brown in the third inning to give the angels the lead for good closer francisco rodriguez earned his third save of the series with a scoreless ninth inning his yankees counterpart , mariano rivera , has not pitched here the loss dropped the yankees to two and a half games behind the boston red sox in the american league east since reaching first place monday , the yankees have lost four of five games , with the journeyman aaron small earning their only victory brown , 40 , expects to have back pain the rest of his life it seems to be inconceivable that he will keep pitching after his contract runs out at the end of this season he spent a month away from the team after his back injury in midjune , but he agreed to come back without a rehabilitation start because the yankees needed him he s never been an excuse maker , torre said he has responded to questions or volunteered information as honestly as anyone we 've known , and a lot of times when he s not feeling good , he s apologetic about it , because he wants to give us what we need from him that might not be possible anymore brown labored in his return monday in texas , allowing 6 hits and 10 runs in four and a third innings , and this game was worse while he walked none in texas , he walked four in this start three came around to score brown also squandered a 31 lead alex rodriguez singled in a run in the first inning , and jeter and cano started the third with successive homers cano s home run extended his hitting streak to 12 games , tied for the longest on the team this season in the bottom of the inning , brown gave the lead right back he walked adam kennedy on five pitches then he walked chone figgins on four after a fly out , catcher jorge posada spoke with brown for a short while in front of the mound whatever posada might have said about pitching to the dangerous guerrero , it made no difference on brown s second pitch , guerrero unloaded on a ball to straightaway center field bubba crosby chased it , but there was no sense in leaping at the wall the ball sailed over crosby s head for a threerun homer that put the angels ahead , 43 rarely has a onerun lead seemed bigger the yankees' momentum vanished with the homer the yankees went down in order in the top of the fourth , and brown walked the leadoff man in the bottom of the inning alex graman , a pitcher the yankees removed from their 40man roster in spring training , started warming in the bullpen kennedy singled with one out , and figgins doubled to the warning track in right field , bringing in two runs to make the score 63 when torre came to the mound to lift brown , he took the ball , said nothing and did not even pat brown on the back graman was little better he gave up a leadoff double to darin erstad , scoring figgins a twoout single by steve finley made the score 83 , and felix rodriguez came in to get the final out of the inning the yankees scored once in the fifth , but they left two runners on that inning and again in the sixth a twoout , tworun homer to center by giambi brought the yankees to within 86 in the seventh it was giambi s fifth home run in four games and his 11th this month inside pitch the yankees' most pressing need before the july 31 nonwaiver trading deadline seems to be relief pitching probably our biggest question right now is getting to the eighth inning consistently , especially with our starting rotation beat up a little bit , manager joe torre said the best reliever available may be tampa bay s danys baez , who has 19 saves and a 270 earned run average the yankees have told the devil rays of their interest , and tampa bay likes class aa third baseman eric duncan but that may be too high a price for the yankees , who want to keep their better prospects and have found it difficult to deal with the devil rays the yankees' top centerfield target appears to be seattle s randy winn , who is playing left field for the mariners seattle wants more power from its outfield and has told teams that winn is available the mariners had a scout at last week s yankees series in texas , and the yankees are scouting seattle this weekend the mariners' biggest need is starting pitching , though , and that is where the yankees are thinnest in the meantime , center fielder bubba crosby made his fifth consecutive start in the field for the yankees torre said that the righthander carl pavano \( shoulder \) could make a minor league start on monday the yankees still expect pavano to start on saturday photo yankees manager joe torre , left ,

washington , dec 22 as members of congress seek more information about the eavesdropping program authorized by president bush , their requests are being complicated by the fact that congressional leaders in both parties acquiesced in the operation only the senate judiciary committee , under arlen specter , republican of pennsylvania , has pledged to hold hearings on the program , which was first publicly disclosed a week ago democrats are urging that the house and senate intelligence committees conduct inquiries , but the republicans who control those panels have not agreed to do so some republicans are suggesting that it is disingenuous to complain now about the eavesdropping effort the record is clear congressional leaders at a minimum tacitly supported the program , representative peter hoekstra of michigan , the chairman of house intelligence committee , said this week mr hoekstra said democrats should attempt to understand why their leaders did not feel the same sense of outrage about the program that some in the party are now expressing senator pat roberts of kansas , the chairman of the senate intelligence committee , has said only that he is currently in discussions with senate leadership to determine what form additional oversight should take senator john d rockefeller iv of west virginia , the top democrat on the committee , released a letter this week that he sent to vice president dick cheney in 2003 expressing concern about the program but senator roberts issued a statement on tuesday saying that he had no recollection of senator rockefeller objecting to the program at the many briefings he and i attended together , and that on many occasions senator rockefeller expressed to the vice president his vocal support for the program his most recent expression of support was only two weeks ago at least seven democratic lawmakers are known to have been briefed about the program since its inception in 2001 , and only two , mr rockefeller and representative nancy pelosi of california , are known to have expressed written concern about it a third , tom daschle of south dakota , the former senate democratic leader , said in an email message on thursday that he too had expressed grave concern for this practice of eavesdropping on american citizens inside the united states among the others , representative jane harman of california , the top democrat on the house intelligence committee , acknowledged in a statement this week that she had been briefed about the program since 2003 and regarded it as essential to us national security ms harman also said , however , that she was deeply concerned by reports that this program in fact goes far beyond the measures to target al qaeda about which i was briefed congressional aides from both parties said thursday that their leaders were weighing a number of options for further inquiries into the matter in the senate , mr specter and mr roberts were said to be talking with senator bill frist of tennessee , the republican leader , about a possible division of labor between their committees but they said it was unlikely that any hearings would be held until congress convenes again in late january the program , authorized by president bush , involves eavesdropping without warrants on international communications involving american citizens in the united states critics , including mr specter , have expressed doubts about whether the program was legal under the foreign intelligence surveillance act , a question he says should be explored by the judiciary committee , even if there is a separate review by the congressional intelligence panels among the options being weighed are parallel inquiries , in which the judiciary committee in the senate would hold open hearings , beginning with testimony by attorney general alberto r gonzales , while the senate intelligence committee would hold closed hearings to explore the classified details of the intelligencegathering operation another course proposed by some lawmakers would consolidate any inquiry so that it would be conducted jointly by the judiciary and intelligence panels members of congress who were not previously briefed about the program have been far more vociferous in expressing opposition to it one of them , representative rush d holt of new jersey , a democrat on the house intelligence committee , said the administration had shown absolute contempt for congressional oversight by concealing , for years after the fact and from all but a tiny handful of house and senate leaders , its use of the national security agency to spy on americans the white house has said the dozen or so briefings about the program it provided to a small group of congressional leaders were intended to provide notification , not to seek the lawmakers' consent none among the seven republicans known to have been briefed have expressed any opposition to the program the three democratic members of congress who have said publicly this week that they had objected to the program have said there was no indication that their objections were heeded ms pelosi , a former top democrat on the house intelligence committee who is now the house democratic leader , has said that she , like mr rockefeller , expressed her concerns in a letter to the administration but ms pelosi has said that she cannot make the letter public until the administration agrees to declassify it mr daschle , in his email message , said he had expressed my concern during the briefing , rather than in written form , and declined to discuss the timing of his action in addition to ms harman , the democrats who have said they did not express objections when they were briefed on the program include senator harry reid of nevada , the democratic leader , and bob graham , the former democratic senator from florida who served as intelligence committee chairman richard a gephardt of missouri , the former democratic leader in the house , has not responded to telephone messages requesting comment ms harman , mr reid and mr graham have all suggested in recent days that they were not provided with a complete accounting of the program , and that they might have raised objections if they had understood its scope the administration has said the surveillance program was limited to communications between the united states and points overseas , but ms harman has expressed particular concern about domestictodomestic surveillance that technical experts say would almost certainly have occurred , in the form of telephone conversations or email messages intercepted inadvertently
mike mussina gripped a baseball in his right hand as he left the yankees' clubhouse after last night s game he moved his fingers around the seams , and fiddled with the ball the way pitchers do for all the ugliness that had occurred , mussina at least had something to cling to the ball had been the last out of his 3 , 000th career inning , back in the second i got there , mussina said , with a hint of embarrassment i do n't know how much farther it looks like i'm going , but i got there there are some games when a starter just does not have it , mussina often says , and last night was one of them he fooled the toronto blue jays for four innings , but he crashed and burned in a disastrous fifth that doomed the yankees to a 95 loss at yankee stadium mussina gave up eight of the blue jays' nine runs in the inning , the highestscoring inning against the yankees this season the yankees scored five runs after that , three coming with two outs in the ninth on bernie williams s first career pinchhit homer but they were too far behind for it to matter , and the yankees are one of three teams who are virtually tied for the lead in the american league wildcard race like the yankees , the oakland athletics are 6956 , and the cleveland indians are 7057 we need to have our pitchers keep us in the game and minimize as much damage as they can , manager joe torre said we were n't able to do that tonight mussina gave up eight runs , six hits and two walks , and his earned run average increased to 421 from 388 he did not shift the blame to an umpire or complain about a questionable hitbypitch call that forced in the blue jays' first run in an inning that brutal , mussina could not pick one turning point mussina said his stuff was not lively in the bullpen , but he caught the blue jays guessing wrong for the first four innings by the time he struck out the first hitter in the fifth , he had allowed only one base runner , on a double by frank catalanotto in the first inning but he walked corey koskie on a full count , and gregg zaun singled to left then reed johnson singled to right , and the thirdbase coach brian butterfield held koskie at third , choosing not to challenge gary sheffield s arm the conservative move paid off eric hinske came up , and mussina s first pitch was up and in , but not by much hinske immediately shook his right hand hinske said later that the ball had struck him on the top of the hand , near the knuckle and the plate umpire eric cooper gave him first base it hit something , but it did n't seem like it hit him , mussina said i thought maybe it hit the knob but the bases were loaded that s not what made or broke the inning none of the yankees argued the call , koskie trotted in with the blue jays' first run , and zaun scored the second when mussina walked orlando hudson with a full count for the blue jays , who had lost five games in a row , the momentum was building he s usually so tough against us , and he was he was rolling , hinske said then all of a sudden , he hit me with the bases loaded and then he walks the next guy , and it just kind of snowballed from there torre thought that the blue jays were laying off the pitches they were missing early in the game , and russ adams seemed to prove the point mussina missed with his first two pitches to adams , who took two strikes before doubling to right , scoring two runs catalanotto then raised his career average against mussina to 426 with a runscoring single it was 50 , blue jays , and with the dangerous vernon wells up next , the game was about to get away eight toronto hitters had come up , and none had swung at the first pitch but wells wasted no time , swinging at a firstpitch fastball i was going up there thinking , 'i just do n't want to make an out , ' wells said everybody else was doing something good i did n't want to make the second out wells connected and stung a laser into the leftfield seats for a threerun homer that chased mussina from the game mussina said it reminded him of a sixrun inning at cleveland three weeks ago , and it was the third time in his career that he had given up eight runs in an inning felix rodriguez replaced mussina and allowed another run , on a double and a single , before the yankees got an out when zaun flied to center , the crowd gave its biggest cheer of the night the blue jays had not scored the last time they made an out now , they had nine runs the yankees , meanwhile , were helpless against toronto starter david bush , who tossed six shutout innings and baffled hitters with his 68mileanhour curveballs torre replaced jorge posada , alex rodriguez and sheffield after the sixth inning , saying he was mindful of today s early start
one by one and usually without being asked the yankees acknowledged on sunday that a mighty challenge lay ahead moments after an invigorating 10 victory over the boston red sox , the yankees said they would have to fight to build on it after all , the tampa bay devil rays are next today s over now , and we go to our nemesis down in tampa , said randy johnson , who has four victories against boston but none against the devil rays if there s going to be any momentum from this homestand , we have to carry it into tampa as alex rodriguez put it we 've got to come out and play well and figure it out there s no time to waste the yankees , who begin a threegame series at tampa tonight , are three and a half games behind boston in the american league east and a game behind cleveland in the wildcard race the devil rays , hapless since their first year in 1998 , have never sniffed a pennant race their greatest contribution to the national consciousness was signing a high school teacher to pitch a few games , inspiring a disney movie they have been ridiculed on the simpsons , they draw the smallest home crowds in the majors and their owner , vince naimoli , once fretted that the tb on the teams' cap would make people think of tuberculosis but the rays as their jerseys say , simply have figured out at least one thing this season the 98pound weakling can push around the bully the yankees came into the season with an 8031 record against tampa bay this season , they are 511 no yankees team under joe torre has ever lost more games against an opponent in one season so are the devil rays in the yankees' heads \? i 'd like to say we 're experienced enough that that s not going to happen , torre said but the whole thing about hitting and pitching is the feel you get and the psychological edge you think you have unless you 've had success , it s hard to latch onto that with a 6084 record , the devil rays seem destined for their seventh lastplace finish how unusual is it for a lastplace team to own the yankees so thoroughly \? no team since the 1922 red sox has finished last and beaten the yankees 12 times in a season the devil rays have dominated the yankees all season , winning 7 of 10 games in the first half despite a gruesome 2861 record at the allstar game break since then , they are 3223 , playing better than several contenders , including the white sox and the angels they 've got a good team , derek jeter said i know their record does n't say it , but they 've got guys that are really starting to play well they have a lot of confidence , especially against us they have guys who know how to play two of the devil rays' young stars , carl crawford and jonny gomes , have played exceptionally well against the yankees \( crawford with a 413 average , gomes at 375 \) and some of the more nondescript devil rays , like nick green \( 314 \) and alex gonzalez \( 310 \) , have also hit well against the yankees the devil rays thrive on the smallball style that has frustrated yankees teams in the past through sunday , they ranked second in the majors in triples , third in stolen bases and , surprisingly , 10th in runs scored they have guys that steal bags and put the ball in play , and they have pitchers that throw the ball well against us , jason giambi said giambi s use of a qualifier against us is significant the devil rays' earned run average is 531 , ranking 29th in the majors through sunday , ahead of only the royals the yankees have contributed to some of that , pounding the devil rays for 19 runs in a game in april , and for 20 in a game in june but in their victories against the yankees , the devil rays have a 330 era their closer , danys baez , has not allowed a run in 11 2 3 innings if you 're ever going to get them , it s going to be their pitching , torre said but we really have n't had success against their pitching as always , there will be more than baseball on the yankees' radar at tropicana field this week there figures to be an undercurrent of tension , especially if the principal owner , george steinbrenner , attends the games , as he often does steinbrenner has long adored the devil rays' manager , lou piniella , the fiery former yankees player and manager torre is signed through 2007 , but if the devil rays release piniella from his contract and the yankees miss the playoffs , speculation will intensify about steinbrenner luring piniella to the bronx there is also plenty of frontoffice intrigue steinbrenner s confidants in tampa are regulars in the dugout at tropicana field , and general manager brian cashman , based in new york , is unsigned past oct 31 cashman has been coy about whether he wants to return , and there is no guarantee that steinbrenner will ask him back this series , especially if the yankees fall flat again , could help determine how steinbrenner will act over the winter inside pitch if the yankees and the boston red sox finish the regular season tied for the american league east title , the teams will play a tie breaker at yankee stadium on monday , oct 3 if a tie breaker is needed to determine the wildcard winner and the yankees are involved , they will play host to oakland or be on the road against cleveland major league baseball held coin flips yesterday to determine the sites
washington could the answer be the arab league \? the question , of course , is how do we get out of iraq \? president bush is increasingly isolated in claiming we are on our way to victory or democracy or human rights or even the restoration of baghdad s electric grid even before iraqi violence began spilling over into jordan , american forces have clearly failed at maintaining order it is time for a different approach , one that may lie with the arab league in lebanon 16 years ago , the arab league ended a seemingly intractable civil war the lebanese christians , druzes , shiites , sunnis , even palestinians had been killing one another since 1975 interventions by syria , israel and the united states made matters only worse president ronald reagan withdrew a contingent of marines after a suicide bombing killed 241 servicemen throughout the 1980 s , private militias fought pitched battles and imprisoned civilian hostages , many of them americans the only way to end the bloodshed seemed to be to divide lebanon along religious lines but none of the factions , not even the christians , wanted the country split exhausted as the lebanese were by the fighting , the vision of a unified nation remained intact that is when the arab league stepped in the arab league was always known as a weakling but the fractious arab states agreed at last that lebanon s civil war and the prospect of partition threatened them all pulling lebanon together was an incentive that superseded their divisions in january 1989 , the arab foreign ministers met and set up a committee of six algeria , jordan , kuwait , sudan , tunisia and the united arab emirates to devise a peace proposal at a subsequent arab league summit , a troika of the saudi and moroccan kings and the algerian president was given six months to come up with an agreement lakhdar ibrahimi , then a highly regarded adviser to algeria s president , was named the project s chief diplomat though mr ibrahimi had no army behind him , he spoke as an arab to arabs , with the full moral authority of the arab community the lebanese listened in september of that year , after mr ibrahimi had negotiated a ceasefire in lebanon , the troika invited lebanon s parliament to meet in taif , a mountain town in saudi arabia , to discuss an arab league draft of a new charter after three weeks of bargaining , the parliamentarians signed an accord based on the draft , with all the lebanese factions conceding more than they ever imagined they would to be sure , the time was right lebanon was fed up with war but crucial to taif was the absence of foreign involvement it was an arab triumph the taif agreement did not produce a perfect ending given lebanon s inherent volatility , that would have been too much to ask for years , syrian and israeli forces continued to intrude in lebanese affairs and taif did not stop the murder of former prime minister rafik hariri and other officials but parliamentary rule has been working , and life has become more or less normal that is far more than anyone expected before taif is there a lesson for president bush \? even more than lebanon s combatants , iraq s factions agree on one thing they want no more western intrusions although iraqis recently ratified a new constitution , the insurgency goes on in contrast to the arab league in lebanon , the united states has a huge army in iraq and no moral force to stop the killing since failing to head off the invasion of iraq , the arab league has been waiting in the wings it has made clear that it considers the regional autonomy contained in the constitution a bad precedent , divided as many arab countries are by sectarianism and with insurgents attacking their diplomats , arab nations have been slow to send representatives to baghdad but given the chance , the arab league might well pull together , as it did in lebanon , to settle what looks increasingly like a hopeless war the arab league can be america s best exit strategy true , we would be asking arabs to clean up our mess but the arab states have an interest both in america s leaving and in iraq s cohesion at the very least , the taif model suggests that arabs are likely to do better than america at getting iraqis to rebuild their society together the alternative , as it was in lebanon , is more bloodshed oped contributor milton viorst is the author of the forthcoming storm from the east the arab world in the 20th century
though its budget for fighting malaria has risen since 1998 to 90 million from 14 million , the united states' foreign aid agency is spending 95 percent of the money on consultants and less than 5 percent on mosquito nets , drugs and insecticide spraying to fight the disease the spending priorities have touched off an intense debate between the agency , the united states agency for international development and its critics , who include two of the senate s most conservative republicans the agency says it has decided to concentrate on offering technical advice while others buy goods but critics accuse it of wasting its growing budget we are spending most of our money on consultants and on meetings and not on getting actual care out in the field , said senator sam brownback , a kansas republican who has introduced a bill to force the agency to spend half of its malaria budget on treatment the critics also accuse the agency of concealing how it spends antimalaria money the list of contractors on its web site has not been updated for four years , and mr brownback said the agency gave him vague descriptions and math that does n't add up he is demanding an audit by the government accountability office another senator , tom coburn , an oklahoma republican , has publicly suggested that the agency s malaria budget be given to the global fund to fight aids , tuberculosis and malaria , the genevabased fund to which the united states has donated more than 1 billion michael miller , the aid agency s deputy assistant administrator for global health , could not give a detailed account of its malaria spending , but he told a senate subcommittee on may 12 that much of the agency s technical advice had been helping foreign countries qualify for grants from the global fund dr richard feachem , the fund s executive director , agreed that such technical advice was often useful because the group has no field officers in the 130 countries where it makes grants but he declined to comment on how much the agency for international development needed to spend providing it mr miller said many poor countries know little about fighting malaria judging his agency by the goods it buys , he said , is like judging an army based on the number of bullets it has you have to have skills and training and know the battlefield the agency s spending patterns were brought to the senators' attention by roger bate and benjamin schwab , experts on thirdworld health at the american enterprise institute , and amir attaran , a professor of law and world health at the university of ottawa giving advice without aid amounts to backseat driving , dr attaran said in an interview , contrasting the spending patterns on malaria to those on famine aid , for which the united states ships many tons of food some of the agency s past advice has drawn sharp criticism from other malaria experts three years ago , as many african nations and global health charities were asking for money for a new malaria drug , artemisinin , the agency opposed them , saying cheaper , older drugs were still useful last year , after the global fund made artemisinin the backbone of its malaria programs , the aid agency endorsed it in his testimony before the subcommittee , dr attaran cited an example of what he considered wastefulness netmark , a 65 million , sevenyear program for social marketing of mosquito nets in africa instead of giving away goods that prevent disease , like mosquito nets , condoms or rehydrating salts , social marketers buy advertising , conduct public education campaigns and create brands , hoping to promote the goods at low prices in the commercial marketplace the social marketers maintain that poor people value goods more when they pay for them instead of getting them free , and that small entrepreneurs can benefit from the sales critics say this means that aid goes only to the richest of the poor in cities that advertising reaches , not to rural villagers who bear the greatest malaria burden netmark is overseen by a regular contractor for the agency for international development , the academy for educational development , a nonprofit corporation with an annual income of 225 million and 1 , 200 employees , most of them in washington mr miller said the netmark program accounted for roughly 10 percent of his agency s spending for malaria , but is not our only net program mary maguire , a spokeswoman for the academy , said 15 million people in four african countries were sleeping under nets because of netmark campaigns , though she acknowledged that 58 million of those nets were supplied by netmark partners , several textile and chemical companies we do n't sell nets , she said we have promotional campaigns to educate people about mosquitoes and brand malaria control we build networks david mcguire , the netmark project manager , said that the program had spent less than 30 million of the 65 million since 1999 , and that 50 percent of the money was spent in africa on advertising , local workers and matching grants to net wholesalers mr mcguire said he had no proof that malaria deaths had gone down anywhere netmark operated because we have no funding to do epidemiological research but the project surveys households to see how many use bed nets and which brands they recognize , he said , and when we got into this in 1999 , there were zero commercial insecticidetreated nets on the market in africa , and now there are at least 15 brands in the countries where we work , and even pirate brands from china none of that would have happened without usaid , he added the international red cross , another major donor in poor countries , takes a different approach it gives free nets directly to new and expectant mothers , because infants and pregnant women have the highest risk of dying of malaria but mr mcguire said free nets often end up being sold by government health workers or channeled to betteroff families with political connections also , he said , giveaways bankrupt small shop owners that sell nets the winds change and funding comes and goes , he added we wanted to make something that lasts longer than the donations dr attaran said he was a little shocked to learn that netmark did not give nets directly to people who need them do we really want to spend 65 million on advertising \? he said , suggesting that he thought it would make more sense to appeal to multinational companies like cocacola , who do a lot of advertising in africa , to give it to us pro bono intensive net giveaway programs are safer than social marketing , he said studies show , he said , that when only a few beds in a village have insecticidetreated nets , the repelled mosquitoes simply bite other villagers
san diego , sept 23 shawne merriman s formal initiation took place late on the afternoon of aug 2 , witnessed by his new brothers and a throng of onlookers merriman becomes quiet when he talks about the ritual he remembers men and women offering congratulations he remembers children asking for autographs and he recalls a friendly voice from the crowd that will touch him forever if you do n't do anything else while you 're here , the voice said , please go out there and rip eli s head off in that moment , before his first practice in the national football league , merriman was welcomed into one of san diego s most select clubs he went from being a player acquired by the chargers to a player acquired for eli manning it took a while for that to totally sink in , said merriman , a rookie linebacker selected with one of the picks the giants sent the chargers for manning at the 2004 draft to be part of that whole ordeal , to be part of a group of guys who are here because of that trade , it s very special to me he scans the locker room for the other members of his pledge class quarterback philip rivers , taken with the giants' firstround pick last year and traded to san diego placekicker nate kaeding , taken with what would have been the giants' thirdround pick last year and defensive tackle luis castillo , who was taken with the chargers' firstround pick this year in part because the team was able to take merriman with the giants' firstround pick their initiation has entailed much more than amusing runins with local fans all four young players none of whom would probably be here if manning had not begged out have started their nfl careers in highly unusual and potentially demoralizing ways rivers has not thrown a meaningful professional pass kaeding has missed one of the most important fieldgoal attempts in franchise history castillo has tested positive for steroids merriman has become the rare rookie to stage a holdout during minicamp they have spent much of their time trying to explain themselves rivers is stuck behind the pro bowl quarterback drew brees kaeding was kicking on a slick field in that fateful playoff game against the jets castillo said he used androstenedione at the nfl combine to recover from an elbow injury merriman skipped offseason workouts because he did not think the chargers' rookie contract protected him in case of an injury shortly after merriman showed up in august , he hurt his toe and his hamstring castillo hurt his toe and his ankle kaeding missed three field goals in the first preseason game at green bay when the chargers came home to play the rams the next week , kaeding got a standing ovation as he ran onto the field i took that as support , kaeding said but i think a lot of people were wondering , 'what next \? ' all will be forgiven , of course , if the chargers beat the giants on sunday night at qualcomm stadium , and if even one of the draft choices plays a significant role that s what everybody here really wants to see , castillo said they want to see us get eli it could be difficult , considering kaeding is a kicker and rivers rarely puts on a helmet merriman has not yet moved into the starting lineup castillo s most significant hit on a quarterback so far resulted in a critical personal foul the chargers , who had a 124 record last season , are 02 , with trips to new england , philadelphia , indianapolis and kansas city still on the schedule the young players are not taking nearly as much criticism as the veteran offensive line , particularly tackle roman oben , who coincidentally came from tampa bay for a fifthround draft choice that the chargers also got from the giants in the manning trade that s a pretty distant connection , oben said i do n't think i really count anybody in this exclusive club has to pay steep dues ever since merriman joined the team , players have changed his nickname lights out to hold out merriman has sought support in the most obvious place he and castillo spent much of the summer talking long distance on the phone , counseling each other through their respective hardships we had a rough draft , castillo said we had our character questioned but the chargers knew deep down what kind of people we were rivers has never complained about his lack of playing time kaeding has accepted all the blame for a season that drifted wide right merriman has asked fans to meet him before making a judgment castillo has written a letter of apology to nfl teams for using andro and offered to return his signing bonus if he ever tested positive again they all have an entire career to change perceptions the trade has not drastically altered san diego s depth chart yet , but it changed the momentum of the franchise at the time of the 2004 draft , the chargers were coming off a season in which their record was 412 when their general manager , aj smith , revealed that manning did not want to play in san diego , the team s leverage looked shot an organization that routinely misused draft choices was about to repeat itself we were all thinking about ryan leaf again , said long snapper david binn , the longesttenured charger , reflecting on the franchise s most extreme disappointment so when commissioner paul tagliabue announced san diego s loot rivers and three draft choices some players declared psychological victory rivers rejoiced at his good fortune kaeding predicted that the chargers would take him with their extra thirdround pick merriman and castillo saw san diego as a desirable destination at the time , rivers thought he might be a starting quarterback kaeding almost never missed a kick merriman and castillo were still in college , unfamiliar with the ways of combines and contract negotiations a year and a half later , they have been called benchwarmers , goats , steroid users and holdouts on sunday night , they finally get to meet the player who made all this possible
darlington , sc , may 6 jimmie johnson arrived at darlington raceway this week defensive and defiant , brushing aside blame for causing two major crashes at talladega superspeedway last weekend but few are letting him off so easily heading into the dodge charger 500 at darlington on saturday this time , johnson may be the one in for a rough ride although johnson enters the nascar nextel cup race as the favorite , having won the two races at darlington last season and having taken the series points lead this season , he is no favorite among many of his peers how is johnson s garage appeal these days \? he was called an idiot this week by none other than dale earnhardt jr hey , my wife calls me that every morning , johnson said dismissively after arriving for practice on thursday he qualified ninth on friday kasey kahne won the pole with a speed of 170024 miles an hour in the big scheme of things , johnson said , if the worst thing i'm called is an idiot , i'm doing all right that is not the worst of it , though johnson is being called a danger to those around him , a damning assessment in a sport where tiny errors can lead to serious injuries asked where johnson stood on the fine line between aggressiveness and recklessness on the racetrack , the 2004 series champion kurt busch said , i think he s running a bit over the edge busch , who is second in points , should know he straddled that line through the first few years of his career before finally settling down along the way , busch learned to be calculating on the racetrack and diplomatic off it he was mostly complimentary of johnson after practice on friday busch also fears the controversy will strengthen johnson down the road , when he will become busch s top competition along with jeff gordon and a handful of others in the hunt for the series title everybody goes through these spells , and what i see as a competitor , this is going to make jimmie better , busch said if it were one crash or one race , perhaps the questions would not be raised about johnson but it has been happening all season johnson , who had relatively few runins with drivers before this season , has been bumping opponents since the daytona 500 , when he had the first of two clashes with tony stewart the two bumped each other on the final lap , and after the race as well then came bristol on april 3 , when johnson s chevrolet tapped jeff burton s chevrolet from behind , putting burton into a spin that led to a wreck with busch johnson chalked it up to hard racing johnson sent stewart into another spinout at phoenix on april 23 , and blamed stewart for brakechecking in front of him and finally there was the 25car crash at talladega on may 1 , followed by a sixcar wreck later in the race johnson was blamed for both i'm racing hard , he said i'm doing my job there s been some things that have popped up that have been well documented , and i 've gone through each of those instances and have moved on , and life goes on as for the big one at talladega , he said i think if you look at the overhead shot of it and you look at what the dynamics were of that , it s easy to see it it s just guys racing two inches apart at 200 miles an hour i mean , two inches is n't much once that s gone , you have a big wreck there is some support for johnson in the garage he was backed by his teammate and car owner , gordon , and by the driver jamie mcmurray when dale earnhardt used to be aggressive , it was a lot of cheers from the stands , and everyone just kind of said , 'that s the way he is , ' mcmurray said and there s some guys that can get away with that more than others i think that jimmie s very aggressive , but there s a lot of drivers that way but the veteran jeremy mayfield said johnson would pay for his behavior what makes you a bigger target is when you do what you 've been doing , mayfield said points leader or not , your target gets bigger and bigger , and the thing about it is , you 've got more people shooting at your target before you realize not that anybody takes anybody out on purpose or anything but , we have a lot of common courtesy amongst ourselves as drivers , and i'm sure that now , if i see the 48 and we 're racing saturday night , i 'll race him just like he s been racing when that happens , everybody 'll start doing you that way and you might not become the points leader anymore it 'd be hard to win a championship when you got a lot of people not really against you but not pulling for you
in reading a posthumous collection of the crisp , elegant columns of shirley povich , i was struck by how similar he was in his personality , his work and his life to my father , red smith , the former sports columnist for the new york times my father and povich , who wrote a sports column for the washington post for almost 75 years , from 1924 \( the year the senators won their only world series \) until 1998 , were close friends and frequent traveling companions along with their pal frank graham , a fellow sports columnist , they were a trifecta that followed the sports calendar from spring training in florida to the world series in the fall they were competitors , of course , but mostly they were friends once the day s columns were filed , they preferred one another s company and that of their wives their families became warm friends and have remained so to this day povich died on june 4 , 1998 , at age 92 his children , david , maury and lynn , along with the former post sports editor george solomon , sorted through some 17 , 000 columns to choose 120 for all those mornings at the post , which was published this month by publicaffairs to mark the centennial of povich s birth the columns are rich , rewarding , often funny , sometimes acerbic comments on the sporting scene povich and my father were gentlemen of the old school , courteous to a fault , polite and modest both were gregarious souls who loved to tell stories , aloud and in print povich used to laugh so hard at his own stories he could hardly finish them but their smiles disappeared when they confronted the selfimportant , especially the privileged sort who tend to own sports teams when provoked , they could skewer the pompous on the point of their pens so skillfully that only the blood would show they were born in the same year , both smalltown boys , povich from bar harbor , me , my father from green bay , wis both went into newspapering at an early age and both became sportswriters by accident povich was assigned to the sports department when he showed up at the post in search of a job he could have wound up in circulation , or advertising my father told a story , which may even be true , of how he ended up in sports by happenstance when he was a copy editor for the st louis star \( it s gone now my father always claimed to have killed every paper he worked for but the new york times \) , there was apparently a scandal after it was discovered that three reporters in the sports department were on the take the three were fired and the editor called my father over as my father told it , the following conversation ensued editor smith , what do you know about sports \? smith just what the average fan knows , sir editor are you honest , smith \? smith i hope so , sir editor what would you do if a fight promoter offered you 10 to write about his fighter \? smith \( long pause \) ten dollars is a lot of money , sir editor that s an honest answer , smith report to the sports department the similarities continued as both my father and povich wrote an amazing seven columns a week , then six , then five , then fewer \( i remember my father was always writing \) both loved baseball first and foremost , and boxing and horse racing and college football and golf and tennis both largely ignored basketball and hockey \( backandforth sports , my father called them \) their shared preference was for games that had a narrative plot line and colorful characters , sports that wrote themselves both were short in stature , and neither was much of an athlete my father was a strong swimmer , a competent diver and a passionate and skilled flyfisherman at notre dame , where he satisfied a physical education requirement by joining the crosscountry team , his coach was knute rockne \( coaching football apparently did not fully justify rockne s salary at the time \) anyway , my father recalled that he competed in one longdistance race and finished last , so far behind the field that rockne took him aside and told him he need not bother entering another race my father once wrote of himself in the third person he admires sports for others and might have been a great athlete himself except that he is small , puny , slow , inept , uncoordinated , myopic and yellow none of those adjectives applied to povich , except possibly the first he was an enthusiastic golfer with about an 18 handicap , his son maury recalled other than that , his daughter , lynn , said , povich s idea of outdoor exercise was to go to the track povich and my father enjoyed long careers and enjoyed is the right verb both saw sports not as lifeanddeath struggles of cosmic import , but as games little boys play their commitments to their columns were such that , even in failing health , both wrote their final pieces days before they died for my father , his column was his contract with life he wanted to hold up his end he seemed to think that when he stopped writing , he would stop living he was right he died on jan 15 , 1982 , at the age of 76 shirley and red two parallel lives , richly lived , artfully written and lovingly remembered backtalk terence smith is senior producer and media correspondent for the newshour with jim lehrer he started his journalism career writing sports , but went straight and spent 20 years covering national and international news for the new york times
bolinas , calif a few months ago , i toured a wisconsin dairy and witnessed something unsettling it was a typical modern dairy , with cows living indoors in a metal building with concrete floors , rather than in the bucolic setting many of us imagine as i walked through the place with the farmer s wife , i noticed that the cows' tails had been cut off and i asked her why well , it s just easier to milk them without their tails , she explained , adding , my husband did n't like the idea , so i did it while he was away fishing for the weekend i felt a warm rush of affection for her husband a cow without a tail , you see , is a sad sight if you live in new york city , as i used to , you probably have n't been around a cow lately and therefore might not be able to picture just how odd a cow looks without her tail so , try to imagine a golden retriever , a tiger cat , or a horse with its tail lopped off sad , right \? at our cattle ranch , where the cows have their tails intact the older cows' tails just reaching the blades of grass i have even found myself admiring the beauty and grace of the cow s tail as she swishes it around and i have often observed just how useful tails are to cattle at certain times of year , cows' tails are in constant motion , flicking away flies and other insects that gather on their backs other than predators , which most farm animals do n't have to worry about very much , flies are the bane of a cow s existence and confinement dairies , which often have dense fly populations , are places where cows are especially in need of their tails but lest you think of the dairy farmer s wife as some misguided villain , it s important to point out that she s just following the trends of her trade the wisconsin dairy farm i visited is in fact becoming the norm although the department of agriculture does not keep official records on the practice , animal protection advocates say that cutting off most or all of animals' tails known as tail docking is now commonplace in the livestock and dairy industries the reasons given in the dairy business are convenience in milking and disease prevention but there is little proof that tail docking , which is generally done without anesthetic , reduces disease and there s plenty of evidence that it makes a cow s life unpleasant in a 2001 article published in the journal of dairy science , university of wisconsin researchers noted that when it comes to tail docking , no positive benefits to the cow have been identified tail docking is also commonplace in the hog industry having visited numerous industrialstyle hog operations , i 've seen nothing but truncated tails on pigs and piglets \( the tails are generally clipped off with wire cutters and without anesthetic \) like a dairy cow , a pig uses its tail not only to shoo away insects but also to communicate like dogs , pigs wag their tails when they are happy , twitch them when they are nervous , let them drop straight down when they are sick they may stick them straight out behind them when they are frightened or alarmed the pork industry s rationale for tail docking is that pigs bite each other s tails and that the tails can then become infected when pigs' tails are cut off , the stubs stay intensely sore and so , the theory goes , the bite will cause so much pain that the bitee will move away from the biter \( the industry refers to this as avoidance behavior \) now , part of this is true tail biting is common in pig herds in confinement buildings but is n't the tail biting a direct result of how they 're being reared in metal buildings with concrete floors , giving pigs nothing to occupy their active minds \? in nature , pigs spend most of their days rooting around in the dirt , exploring and grazing stuck inside , bored pigs often bite one anothers' tails one of the many vices or abnormal behaviors that occur when pigs are raised in confinement however , the real question is not why tail biting occurs in modern hog buildings but whether cutting off the tails of pigs raised in confinement reduces it so far , the research is not encouraging several european studies show that cutting off pigs' tails has little or none of the desired effect a 2003 british study , for example , found that tail docking was associated with a threefold increase in the risk of tail biting the animal welfare institute , which promotes humane animal farming , prohibits tail docking in its pig farming protocols the standards state , a behaviorally appropriate environment and good nutrition normally eliminate the need for routine taildocking \( full disclosure my husband founded a network of family farms that insists on these methods \) given the suffering it causes animals and its dubious benefits , tail docking should be stopped britain , norway , the netherlands , sweden and switzerland all prohibit tail docking of dairy cows , and the european union adopted a directive in 1991 barring routine docking of pigs' tails while the department of agriculture has undertaken a study of pig tail docking that is expected to be released in september , the department should begin to find ways to discourage livestock and dairy farmers from their acrosstheboard embrace of the practice eventually , though , our consciences and common sense as well as science should tell us that we need an outright ban until that day , the only way to see real pigs' tails will be to find a farmer using traditional farming methods luckily , i know quite a few walking through the pastures that belong to paul willis , an iowa hog farmer , it s a relief to see tails waving in the air to see pigs chasing one another , rolling in the grass , digging in the earth mr willis feels that he does not need to dock his animals' tails his pigs have plenty to occupy themselves and , he adds , i like seeing pigs with their tails oped contributor nicolette hahn niman is a lawyer and rancher
paris , june 5 in the end , nothing could stop rafael nadal from winning the french open on his first attempt not the pressure that came with being the favorite not the world s no 1 player , roger federer , in the semifinals not the unseeded but inspired mariano puerta in the final not even the rain that began spitting down at the end of the second set on sunday and that french forecasters had predicted could postpone the end of the final until monday nadal soared above it all , leaping high in the air to punctuate his finest efforts and grinding away back on earth like a hardened veteran as he tracked down shots that should have been winners and smacked plenty of winners of his own if he did not have a spanish passport that proved it , it would be hard to believe that he turned 19 on friday but tennis is a game that lends itself to the boundless energy and nodoubts attitude of teenagers , and now it has its latest prodigy nadal s stirring and sometimes thrilling 67 \( 6 \) , 63 , 61 , 75 victory over puerta , in which he had to fight off three set points on puerta s serve to avoid a fifth set , made him the first man to win at roland garros on his first visit since mats wilander did it at age 17 in 1982 he is the youngest man to win a grand slam event since pete sampras won the united states open at 19 in 1990 but this title was no bolt from the blue , like michael chang s strangerthanfiction run here at age 17 in 1989 sunday s victory was nadal s 24th in a row , and it gave him his fourth consecutive title on clay , the game s most physically demanding surface but holding up the trophy clearly meant more to him for the first time , i cried after winning a match , he said in a news conference with la coupe des mousquetaires glittering by his side for me , this trophy means that i am now at the same level as the other great players who won the french open , the ones i watched on television to be on the same list as they are is a dream he sent a strong message on clay in december by providing the firstday spark for spain in its davis cup final victory over the united states even though his precocious success has made him a fastmoving target for the past six weeks , none of his elders have been able to deliver a knockout blow not in monte carlo , not in barcelona , spain , not in rome and , most significantly , not in paris i think we are talking about someone who is going to write a page in the history of tennis , said puerta , a 26yearold argentine who had never been past the third round in a grand slam tournament he s going to become a legend this final , the first alllefthanded final in 59 years here , was viewed as a potential mismatch nadal beat puerta in their two previous matches in straight sets but puerta , whose hardrunning , topspinheavy game bears a strong resemblance to nadal s , came closer than anyone here to pushing the fourthseeded nadal to the fringes of his prodigious talent none of nadal s other opponents , including federer , seriously threatened to take him to a fifth set , but puerta was on the verge when he found himself serving at 54 , 4015 in the fourth nadal was contorting his chubby face into a pained expression but that did not mean he was going to stop running and digging on the next point , with puerta in control of the rally , nadal lunged to his right and nailed a backhand passing shot crosscourt that puerta no sampras at the net could not handle on the next point , the two men traded drop shots , and puerta ended up missing a diving forehand volley into the net but puerta is not the sort to crumble in the face of adversity either , as he has proved in the last year by making a remarkably quick comeback after a ninemonth suspension for failing a drug test in the fifth set , it could have been either of us , puerta said we were 5050 when i went onto the court , he was the favorite it was clear to me but at the end of the fourth , i did n't see him that way anymore puerta earned another set point with a strong first serve , but he missed forehands on the next two points suddenly , instead of heading into a fifth set with a chance to test nadal s questionable physical reserves , puerta was facing break point , and nadal , in an exchange that will soon be a part of french open highlight films , did not give puerta a chance to recover a good first serve earned puerta a short highbouncing return , but he opted for a drop shot it was a good one and would have been a winner against just about anybody else playing professional tennis , but nadal sprinted forward and put it back in play puerta hit a hard volley straight at nadal , who hit a reflex volley straight back at puerta , who missed it wide nadal , his eyes bulging , wheeled toward his large family in the stands and made a deliberately slow pump of the fist it was 55 , and puerta never quite recovered i wonder how he was able to get that ball , puerta said of the drop shot he has very strong legs he moves so well he runs so fast nadal held serve with relative ease , then sent a strong message on puerta s serve at 1515 with a rare backhand winner down the line he then took command at 3030 with a forehand winner that caught puerta heading the wrong way it was match point , and the photographers were hustling in the stands to get an angle on nadal , who had created so many extreme angles over two weeks nadal returned puerta s second serve and was soon rewarded with a forehand unforced error wide he could finally stop hustling , and he celebrated by falling flat on his back in the clay these moments are moments when everything hits you , nadal said you see all the work you 've done all these years , all the sacrifices before long , in his claystained sleeveless shirt and kneelength pants , nadal was shaking hands with all the right people , including juan carlos , the king of spain , who made the trip to paris to watch his nation s latest sports superstar in action nadal s life , like those of the teenage champions wilander and sampras and chang before him , will never be the same
newark , march 10 in their continuing assault on political corruption in monmouth county , federal prosecutors on thursday arrested three men on money laundering charges , including two businessmen with extensive public contracts in the county the arrests brought to 14 the number of people caught up in an fbi sting operation two weeks ago , 10 elected or appointed officials in the county were arrested on charges of accepting bribes in exchange for government contracts an 11th was charged with money laundering one of those arrested on thursday was stephen appolonia , the owner of international trucks of central new jersey , a dealership in howell the monmouth county prosecutor , john kaye , has said that mr appolonia figured in a separate investigation by his office mr kaye has come under fire from federal law enforcement officials who , speaking on the condition of anonymity , said last month that his actions had forced them to abruptly curtail their corruption investigation acting gov richard j codey has asked the state attorney general to investigate mr kaye s conduct , and other officials have called for mr kaye , a 22year county prosecutor , to step down mr kaye did not return several calls to his office seeking comment in addition to mr appolonia , 52 , of colts neck , nj , fbi agents arrested james ingram , 54 , of middletown , an owner of jbi limousine inc , of neptune , and thomas a greenwald , 52 , a far hills council member and friend of mr appolonia lawyers for the three men declined to comment michael drewniak , a spokesman for united states attorney christopher j christie , said the federal investigation into the county is continuing he said that secretly recorded comments of the three men showed how mr ingram routinely took care of public officials with cash and favors in return for rigged bids on municipal work and to present fruitful avenues to pursue a spokesman for monmouth county , bill heine , said thursday that county officials planned to take a look at any and all contracts that the county has with mr appolonia s and mr ingram s companies the three men were arrested at their homes early thursday and appeared before magistrate madeline cox arleo in federal district court here to hear the charges against them they did not enter pleas and were released on 250 , 000 bond each pending indictment according to federal complaints , the three conspired with a man posing as a floridabased construction company owner to launder about 350 , 000 that he told them were the proceeds from his side business as a loan shark the businessman was the same person who law enforcement officials said had bribed the officials arrested two weeks ago court papers detailed how the businessman met mr ingram , mr appolonia and his friend , mr greenwald , through an unnamed and , so far , uncharged , public official the complaints said the men agreed to help the businessman launder the cash in chunks of 25 , 000 , 50 , 000 and 100 , 000 in return for 10 percent mr greenwald was brought into the scheme by mr appolonia , the investigators said , and his participation was not related to his official duties in far hills mr kaye said in an interview two weeks ago that mr appolonia figured in his investigation into the theft of a countyowned truck from the dealership s lot earlier this year , as well as zoning changes in howell and the suicide last fall of a former county deputy sheriff who had cooperated with federal investigators in other cases and had bragged of bribing public officials both mr appolonia and mr ingram did significant business with local governments mr appolonia s familyowned companies , for instance , have extensive contracts to service and sell trucks to towns in the county though none of those contracts figured in the charges filed against the men on thursday , they remain a focus of federal investigators between 1998 and 2002 middletown bought five trucks from mr appolonia s company for a total of 465 , 000 , mayor thomas hall said asbury park and west long branch also did business with the company , according to officials in those towns current or former elected officials from all three towns as well as three appointed officials responsible for transportation and emergency service contracts in the county were among those arrested by federal prosecutors late last month mr ingram s company has done about 3 million in business through contracts with monmouth county over the last year , mr heine said the limousine company provides hundreds of trips a week for residents , including the elderly , that the county pays for , he said during one of the secretly recorded conversations involving mr ingram , an unnamed public official was heard bragging about how he gave mr ingram s limousine company a multimillion county transportation contract at another point , mr ingram told undercover agents that he routinely gave another public official cars and allowed him to pocket the money from reselling them in exchange for his tailoring some county bid specifications to his liking in another secretly recorded conversation , according to court papers , mr greenwald told undercover agents how he had hired an exconvict to beat someone who owed him money the man was beaten so badly with a baseball bat that he stutters to this day , according to the papers in fending off a suggestion by an assistant united states attorney , matthew mccarren , that this tendency to violence made mr greenwald a threat should he be released on bond , his lawyer , paul fishman , insisted that the story was not true and simply banter among the men
if voters are angry about economic legislation that rolls back the social welfare state , and they take out their anger on the governing party , does that make more such legislation inevitable \? as undemocratic as that might sound , investors in germany seem to think so as financial analysts said chances of new legislation had increased , the country s stock market rallied monday after a stinging defeat in regional elections for the social democratic party of chancellor gerhard schr \? , which led him to call for national elections in the fall early elections could be a positive trigger to recatalyze the reform agenda , wrote julian callow , chief european economist for barclays capital , arguing that the leaderships of both major german parties wish to embark upon new reforms perhaps the most remarkable thing about european politics , at a time when the governments of most western european countries appear to be unpopular , is that the unpopularity has done nothing to shake the consensus among political leaders that legislation to reduce the welfare state and make it easier to hire and fire workers is needed for europe to regain its competitive position so far , the major western european governments have enacted halting reorganizations , with germany perhaps going the farthest as it cut back on unemployment benefits the changes have begun to inflict pain but have not produced much measurable improvement in macroeconomic statistics growth is slower , and unemployment higher , than a few years ago , and governments in germany , france and italy suffered stinging defeats in regional elections in the first five years of the current decade , gross domestic product in the united states and britain rose more than 13 percent cumulatively , compared with the fourth quarter of 1999 in france , the figure was under 10 percent , while in germany , italy and the netherlands the figure was 5 percent or less italy is in a recession , but the government of prime minister silvio berlusconi managed to cobble together a new coalition to avoid early elections even though leaders of the two largest political parties in france are campaigning for the proposed european union constitution , polls still show a narrow majority for opponents in the referendum to be held sunday in the netherlands , which votes a few days later , polls indicate opponents have a larger majority dutch unemployment is far below that of many of its neighbors 5 percent based on a standardized definition used by the organization for economic cooperation and development , versus 98 percent in germany and france but that rate is twice what it was in 2001 , and fear of immigration and immigrants has changed the dutch political landscape rejection of the constitution would have little immediate practical effect , since the european union would still operate with its current structure but rejections could come to be seen as a protest from voters over changes being made that they do not like , including the adoption , albeit in watereddown form , of legislation aimed at making it easier to hire and fire workers and to cut back on state pension benefits trying to head off defeat for the constitution , the french president , jacques chirac , has argued that the constitution would help to preserve the european social welfare systems , but many backers of the systems remain hostile to the constitution and to changes enacted by mr chirac s government in germany , none of the parties have spelled out the economic platforms they will run on if the election is this fall they appear to agree on some areas in which legislative action has stalled , like a proposal to lower the corporate tax rate to 19 percent from 25 percent while both the social democrats and the opposition christian democrats support that reduction , they have differed over how to finance it , and it appears unlikely to pass , in part because the opposition does not want mr schr \? to get the credit the social democrats' defeat in regional elections has left the upper house of germany s parliament under the control of the opposition , which has made it much harder to pass legislation elga bartsch , a european economist for morgan stanley , said monday that she thought that an opposition victory in a german national election this year would be good news for germany s economic growth prospects and for further structural reforms she said that in its first years in office , a government led by the christian democratic leader , angela merkel , would be likely to enjoy substantial majorities in both houses of parliament and therefore be able to enact reforms just what those changes would be is far from clear one idea suggested by ms merkel is to stop paying for the national health care system through a tax on wage earners , which opponents say drives up the cost for employers and discourages hiring instead , she suggested a flat tax on all beneficiaries of the system , whether or not they were fulltime wage earners but , ms bartsch said , the christian democrats' allies in bavaria , the christian social union , might not support the idea , which means their combined election platform might be vague after the 2002 german election , which mr schr \? narrowly won , he embraced a package of measures he called agenda 2010 as enacted , the proposals have cut back on germany s unemployment benefits system and introduced other changes in pensions and health care anger at the changes is widely believed to have contributed to his party s defeat in the election on sunday in the state of north rhinewestphalia , and in the final days of campaigning his party adopted some antibusiness themes , seeking to win back disappointed leftists voting for the cdu sunday meant putting a stop to schr \? s reform agenda , ms bartsch said but in the future , if the cdu has power , there is no stopping the reforms photo chancellor gerhard schr der of germany at a briefing sunday as his party faced defeat in regional elections \( photo by arnd wiegmann reuters \)
ofra , west bank , aug 22 a distraught yuval unterman was carried from his home by israeli soldiers in a gaza strip settlement on wednesday after five hours in his family s hot , cramped station wagon , he and his wife and children took up temporary residence in this west bank settlement of the 39 families evacuated from the morag settlement , 23 are here in ofra , a large settlement not far from the palestinian city of ramallah as their children played monday on the grassy grounds beneath tall palm trees , the uprooted gaza settlers said they wanted to remain together as a community but had reached no decisions about where they would ultimately live a west bank settlement was one possibility we feel very welcome here , said michal unterman , 29 , mr unterman s wife the reception has been very kind , and they have provided us with everything we have hot meals they are taking care of our laundry they have provided us with everything from soap to toothbrushes israel on monday wrapped up its withdrawal of the nearly 9 , 000 settlers from the gaza strip despite the pullout , there will almost certainly be more jewish settlers at the end of this year than at the beginning , said yariv oppenheimer , the leader of peace now , an israeli group that opposes settlement building the west bank settler population is about 240 , 000 with the number increasing by more than 10 , 000 a year , the growth will offset those who have been removed , even if none of the evacuees resettle in the west bank the figures do not include israelis in east jerusalem palestinians , as well as israeli critics of the settlements , say the gaza evacuation was welcomed , but they note that prime minister ariel sharon says he plans to continue strengthening the much larger west bank settlements mr oppenheimer said he expected settler leaders to push for the gaza evacuees to relocate in the west bank the settler leadership has a political interest in showing that this was not a defeat , and that it will only result in the further building of west bank settlements , he said many gaza settlers are going to the west bank , at least as a first stop as the final gaza settlement , netzarim , was cleared out monday , the west bank settlement of ariel prepared to accommodate most of the evacuees in dormitory rooms at the college of judea and samaria last wednesday , the stress of the evacuation was etched on the untermans' faces as they spent hours in futile negotiations with military officers on monday , they were much more relaxed , and occasionally joked as they spoke with a reporter while sitting in the grass near a playground in ofra they were accompanied by several of their six children , all under age 10 , and a small brown dog still , monday was another difficult day the army demolished the houses in morag , where the family lived for nine years we ca n't even think about a new home while the old one is still standing , said mr unterman , 30 , who managed a library and taught computer skills but maybe by tomorrow that day will be here the israeli government and the palestinian leadership agreed that the settlers' houses would be torn down settlers did not want palestinians moving into their old homes , and palestinians said the singlefamily houses with gardens did not suit their needs in overcrowded gaza the palestinian leader , mahmoud abbas , last week announced plans to build apartments for 3 , 000 palestinians in morag , which was home to about 200 jewish settlers the morag settlers , bypassing the government agency set up to help relocate them , came to ofra in an arrangement between leaders in the two settlements the untermans , like roughly onethird of the 1 , 500 families evacuated from gaza , have refused to contact the agency , known by its hebrew acronym , sela the morag families are being housed in the girls' dormitory of a school and have been told that they can stay as long as they like the couple grew up in and around the northern city of haifa they chose morag because it was small and isolated , and they will be looking for a similar environment ofra , a large , wellestablished settlement , already feels too developed for their tastes , the couple said as the gaza evacuees ponder their future , some are wary of buying a home in the west bank out of concern that some of the 120 west bank settlements could be dismantled in the future i hear people saying they do n't want to go to a place where they might be thrown out again , said haim gross , a community leader from morag so i tell them 'do n't go to jerusalem this government could throw you out of any place ' some evacuees have complained that the government has failed to find temporary housing or make other arrangements but haim altman , a spokesman for sela , said the government had plenty of hotel rooms , rental apartments and mobile homes available and had tried for months to reach the gaza settlers by phone , by letters and via its web site they chose not to contact us , because they thought this day would never come , mr altman said now that it is a fact , we hope they will talk mr unterman said he was still not prepared to deal with the government , which is offering compensation of 200 , 000 or more to most families but his family , he said , is coming to grips with the new reality we 're not desperate or broken , he said in the coming days we will find a solution
love and sex are commodities only as durable as cut flowers and perhaps no more significant in the immaculate drawing room where the unromantic comedy the constant wife unfolds the pragmatic heroine of w somerset maugham s 1926 play , constance middleton , is a wellgroomed englishwoman who refuses to let the scandal of a straying husband mar the perfection of her emotional d cor she simply rearranges the furniture around the uncomfortable fact , and carries on , wiser perhaps , but certainly not sadder broadway has been in the reupholstering business for a long time , but producers do not often forage deeply in the antiques fair of theatrical history for material as obscure as this to restore to the repertory although maugham , best known as a novelist , wrote many popular plays in the early decades of the century , none have landed a berth on the unofficial list of enduring classics in comparison with most of maugham s other plays , the constant wife has actually been a fairly frequent visitor to broadway it has previously served as a vehicle for ethel barrymore \( in 1926 \) , katharine cornell \( 1951 \) and ingrid bergman \( 1975 \) a jaunty , efficient kate burton undertakes the role of constance for the stylish new roundabout theater company production , directed by mark brokaw , which opened last night at the american airlines theater ms burton is not a star on the order of barrymore , cornell or bergman , of course who today is \? that s a small pity , since a shot of highvoltage glamour would probably help disguise signs of decay in maugham s play , which is merely an elaborate comic trifle , all glittering surface shellacking an emotional void but ms burton s brisk professionalism her crystalline elocution and assured british accent , her robust but never vulgar sense of comedy will do fine , thank you , until they start manufacturing the likes of cornell and barrymore again \( fat chance \) constance is offstage as the play begins , her fraying marriage the object of decorous but intense debate among various interested parties her mother , mrs culver , played by the dryly imperious lynn redgrave , has planted herself on constance s sofa in order to deny her spinster daughter , martha \( enid graham \) , the pleasurable duty of informing constance that her husband is deceiving her constance s friend barbara \( kathleen mcnenny \) , who also knows about the affair , has come to offer her a partnership in her decorating business , as either a consolation or a financial lifeline should the marriage break apart but their feminine sympathies are collectively confounded when it is revealed that constance knows full well that her husband , john , has been carrying on with her best friend , the frilltrimmed flirt marielouise \( a winkingly pert kathryn meisle \) after a protracted comic scene in which constance crisply dismisses marielouise s husband s suspicions , despite hard proof of the lovers' intimacy , she explains her position i was fond enough of john to be willing that he should be happy in his own way , she says airily , and if he was going to indulge in an intrigue , then it was much better that the object of his affection be so intimate a friend of mine that i could keep a maternal eye on him constance s dreadfully civilized approach to john s infidelity is equally astonishing to her abashed but grateful husband \( michael cumpsty , jolly in his mortification \) he is less delighted when constance explains the reasons for her indifference , namely the simultaneous cooling of her own ardor for him and he is dismayed and outraged when , in the last of the three acts in the play \( it is performed here with one intermission \) , the evercool constance unveils a plan to exact revenge at its best , the constant wife suggests a sugarcoated shaw play constance s wry observations about the practicalities of uppercrust marriage and its mercenary foundations \( the modern wife is nothing but a parasite , there is only one freedom that is really important and that is economic freedom \) must have struck clarion , provocative notes in the 1920 s maugham s writing also evokes oscar wilde , albeit wilde diluted with lavender water the elaborate aphorisms dropped by constance and her mother tend to sound wittier than they actually are , thanks to the gently italicized delivery of ms burton and ms redgrave mr brokaw and his cast occasionally betray a desire to bend this comedy of manners toward farce ms burton s strenuous business with a series of handkerchiefs marks a rare slide into obviousness this instinct may derive from an impulse to distract us somehow from the play s eventually exhausting triviality , which gradually gnaws away at the pleasure to be taken in the ingenuity of maugham s narrative and the dainty flavor of his eversoanglo dialogue as the manicured language flows on and on \( think what a bore it is to have someone in love with you whom you 're not in love with i ca n't conceive of your ever being a bore , constance \) , a sense of sterility begins to pervade the stage the suspicion grows that allen moyer s ornately elegant set , awash in chinoiserie , and michael krass s beautifully cut , colorful period costumes have as much real character as the chattering people draped in and around them even dear constance , who , for all ms burton s winning energy and warmth , is so infernally good and wise and competent that you come to suspect iced earl grey tea runs in her veins everybody talks frankly , smartly , sometimes wittily of love and sexual passion , of the naughty things that men do and the wicked or noble women who accommodate them , but for maugham s characters these turbulent life forces do not seem to have a tangible reality that would justify postponing a game of tennis like constance , maugham seems to suggest that human nature , in its silly squalor , is not a thing to get worked up about when there are more serious matters to ponder , like the weather or the wallpaper the constant wife by w somerset maugham directed by mark brokaw sets by allen moyer costumes by michael krass lighting by mary louise geiger sound by

they 've chased each other around the world , had their faces plastered on the sides of buses and sniped at each other through surrogates , all in service of their respective evening news broadcasts one even had his name displayed on a banner that was towed by a small plane , beachresort style , over the rooftops of manhattan last week to promote a primetime documentary about ufo s now , like combatants in an initial round of presidential primaries , brian williams , who replaced tom brokaw as anchor of nbc nightly news on dec 2 , and peter jennings , the veteran anchor of world news tonight on abc , have gone headtohead long enough it will be three months on wednesday for one of them to lay legitimate claim to an early lead in the only race that really counts the ratings that anchor is mr williams , who , according to nielsen media research , has drawn more viewers than mr jennings during each week since he succeeded mr brokaw , at least through feb 18 , the last date for which data were available with their 11week winning streak , mr williams and his colleagues on nightly news believe they have provided a tentative answer to a question that had swirled in television news circles from the day in may 2002 that nbc announced that he would succeed mr brokaw would the anchor shift , the first in more than two decades on a network evening news broadcast , serve to erase the ratings lead that mr brokaw had held for the last eight years \? i felt very strongly , very personally , that i wanted to maintain tom s lead , mr williams said in an interview from his studio on friday the team i worked with and that i inherited from tom is still here in this newsroom i wanted , for them , to remain the dominant newscast and yet , there are several statistical trends those below the level of mere weekswonandlost suggesting that the race between mr jennings and mr williams has drawn tighter than that between mr jennings and mr brokaw for example , in the category of viewers between the ages of 25 and 54 the demographic against which advertising is sold mr jennings has shaved mr brokaw s lead by twothirds , when the 11 weeks that ended feb 18 are compared with the same period a year ago , according to nielsen \( in that category , mr williams has drawn an average of 36 million viewers each night over the last 11 weeks , in contrast to 35 million for mr jennings \) over all , mr williams drew an average of 714 , 000 more viewers each night over those first 11 weeks than mr jennings 108 million , to 101 million for mr jennings that margin is nearly a third smaller than the millionviewer lead that mr brokaw held over the same period last year , but it is sizable by eveningnews standards brad adgate , senior vice president and director of research for horizon media , which places television advertising for ace hardware and mutual of omaha , among other clients , said he had been following the ratings trends closely and believed that nbc has a right to crow the fact that nbc has held its lead is testament to the fact that people are comfortable with the network they 're comfortable with its news , and that brian williams is a comfortable anchor for them , he said for all the heated marketing on both sides it was mr jennings whose name was on that banner promoting the ufo special mr jennings has yet to vanquish mr williams , who is 21 years his junior , in abc s bid to reclaim the ratings title it yielded to mr brokaw and nbc in the 19961997 television season we knew based on the history of this stuff that people s viewing habits do n't change in evening news that quickly , said jon banner , executive producer of mr jennings s broadcast the success we 've had in the first couple of months has been very pleasing for us mr jennings responded to a request for an interview about his new competition by issuing a short statement through a publicist that read , in part it s a long road and we will undoubtedly learn from each other continuing a trend that has been documented for more than a decade , amid rising competition from cable and the internet , all three newscasts lost viewers over the last three months when compared with the same period a year ago though the losses of abc s broadcast \( 44 percent \) and nbc s \( 67 percent \) were dwarfed by the losses of cbs evening news with dan rather \( 108 percent \) mr rather , 73 , who trailed mr williams by an average of 3 million viewers over the last three months , announced in late november that he would step down as anchor on march 9 , the day he will mark 24 years in the job with cbs s longterm plans unknown bob schieffer , the host of face the nation , will succeed mr rather on an interim basis the marquee matchup remains between mr williams and mr jennings , and more than just bragging rights for two of the nation s most visible broadcast journalists are at stake though none of the networks disclose such information formally , each of the three evening newscasts is believed to earn in excess of 100 million in annual advertising revenue but the difference between no 1 and no 2 is substantial as much as 20 million annually , according to several network executives the principals make a lot of money as well an estimated 10 million annually for mr jennings and 5 million for mr williams , according to associates though how much longer mr jennings , 66 , will occupy his anchor chair is not known mr jennings s contract expires later this year he has declined , as recently as an interview in late october , to speculate about his future asked on friday about whether an extension of mr jennings s contract was under discussion , jeffrey schneider , an abc news spokesman , pointed a reporter to an earlier interview with david westin , president of abc news mr westin had said i expect him to be the anchor of 'world news tonight' for several years to come for now , mr jennings and mr williams , 45 , will continue to square off in a variety of venues last summer and fall , for example , mr jennings was featured in an abc advertising campaign with a slogan trust is earned that nbc and others in the industry interpreted as a swipe at mr williams when asked to take the measure of mr williams s performance thus far , steve capus , executive producer of nightly news , could n't resist a dig at that campaign guess what , he said trust has been earned mr banner , mr capus s counterpart at abc , declined an opportunity to comment on nbc s marketing slogan for mr williams reporting america s story but mr banner did refer to the ubiquity of print , television and billboard ads featuring mr williams in tie and shirtsleeves at a certain point , he said , we know what matters is not if we 're on every bus or every cable channel the two broadcasts have also competed to see which can get its anchor out of his new york studio most often mr williams got out of the box early , traveling to banda aceh , indonesia , the region hardest hit by the tsunami , in early january mr jennings , much to his irritation , was stuck in new york with a respiratory infection but mr jennings rebounded , spending 10 days in baghdad in late january for the iraqi election , compared with mr williams s 4 days peter was all over the election , mr banner said in something of a rebuttal , barbara levin , an nbc news spokeswoman , cautioned a reporter in an email message one important distinction you should know while in baghdad , brian anchored the entire broadcast while after the first block jennings threw to an anchor in the studio in new york this is very different than us in terms of content , neither broadcast has changed markedly in the last few months over a longer period the last 18 months world news tonight , has made a conscious effort to devote two and often three segments to a single news event whether on the war in iraq or the effort to reform social security to provide context that internet news sites often cannot , mr banner said nbc has changed little from the brokaw era , though it does allow mr williams to read an occasional essay a recent one was about the death of rosemary kennedy , the former president s sister and to crack an occasional joke , as he did after a recent report that encouraged the use of painkillers during childbirth \( now they tell us , observed mr williams , a father of two \) in an interview friday , jeff zucker , president of nbc universal television group , indulged in the sort of crowing to which mr adgate , the media buyer , said he was entitled the competition has been in place for 20 years , mr zucker said of mr jennings and mr rather it s not like the audience had n't made up their minds on the competition mr williams tends to take a more guarded view we are all a very superstitious bunch , he said friday i feel terrific about where this newscast is until i think about tomorrow
the university creamery at penn state , a campus staple since 1896 , is as an indelible part of the local culture as crisp autumn afternoons at beaver stadium and joe paterno s doublewide glasses as no 16 penn state has charged to a 50 record this season , the roots of the nittany lions' football revival can be traced to a place best known for serving double scoops of peachy paterno on a visit to penn state for a camp in the summer of 2004 , the topflight recruits derrick williams and justin king parted ways in the parking lot of the creamery with a handshake deal the penn state assistant coach jay paterno overheard the two conversing as williams climbed into his car for the ride home to maryland are you coming here \? king asked williams well , if you 're coming here , then i'm coming here , williams responded it could be one of the most important double scoops served in the creamery s centuryplus existence the arrivals of williams and king at penn state have revived an offense that sputtered the past two seasons , when penn state stumbled to a combined 716 record they have combined with their fellow freshmen receivers deon butler and jordan norwood to give some muchneeded speed to the offense that has coalesced with a veteran , hardnosed defense to make penn state a big ten conference contender for the first time since 1999 with no 6 ohio state visiting happy valley on saturday night , some fans may be thinking that a victory could put penn state in contention for the national championship the difference this year is that we have speed on the outside with them , penn state quarterback michael robinson said of the four freshmen you mix that with the experience we have on the offensive line and on defense , and we 're a different team that transformation started with a phone call to the defensive coordinator tom bradley s office on a monday night last november the nittany lions' coaches were anxiously waiting for king , the top defensive back prospect in the nation , to make his college decision ten minutes before announcing publicly , he called bradley coach , i want to thank you for everything , bradley recalled king telling him but i'm going to go to michigan bradley began mumbling on the phone after all , he had seen a flock of stars from pennsylvania chad henne , tim massaquoi , marlin jackson and steve breaston leave the area for michigan and thrive but before bradley could halfheartedly wish king good luck , king said , just kidding , coach , i'm coming to penn state \( king s stepfather , terry smith , who played at penn state , was chuckling heartily while listening in on the conversation \) williams , the nation s top prospect at wide receiver , came through on his end of the creameryhatched agreement soon after they enrolled in school in january and have done nothing but impress since that includes winning over coach joe paterno for significant playing time as freshmen , something longconsidered about as probable paterno wearing contact lenses i think coach felt comfortable with them , bradley said i think he got to know these kids real well in the recruiting process and in the spring he felt comfortable with their maturity paterno certainly cannot dispute the results williams has averaged 1116 yards a game , providing a threat running , catching and returning kicks he has scored three touchdowns , none bigger than the game winner in the final minute at northwestern two weeks ago king , who has also played at cornerback this season , has averaged 442 yards a game , a combination of receiving and running he has also scored two touchdowns , both receiving and an offense that finished last season ranked no 104 nationally has improved to no 20 jay paterno credits williams and king for having the vision and foresight to see that the nittany lions , who went 47 last season , returned the core of a defense that did not give up more than 21 points in a game last year all penn state needed were some more offensive weapons we did n't want to jump on a bandwagon , williams said we wanted to go somewhere we can have an impact the impact could be seen late saturday night , as jay paterno walked with his father past the creamery , where happy fans lined up for more than a block and a half for some postgame dessert after a 4414 thrashing of minnesota many were already buzzing about the ohio state game , one that has been eagerly awaited for a long time by the nittany lions' faithful our fans are so hungry for us to get back to where we belong , jay paterno said they can thank an ice cream parlor recruiting coup for helping them get there costly victory for alabama on the same day he won his biggest game in his three seasons as alabama s coach , mike shula may have also made his most regrettable decision the no 7 crimson tide are 50 after thrashing florida , 313 , but shula may have hamstrung the tide s season by leaving in his starters too long alabama s only dynamic breakaway threat , receiver tyrone prothro , broke his leg with less than nine minutes remaining in the game he is out for the season it leaves you with an empty feeling to see the nature of the injury , shula said my heart goes out to him it is a chillingly familiar situation for shula , who lost quarterback brodie croyle for the season last year after he was injured in the third quarter with alabama leading western carolina , 310
after two weeks of angst and considerable reflection , antonio davis finally got comfortable with the idea of becoming a knick then he stepped into the locker room yesterday and was hit with a new set of strange feelings davis was given allan houston s locker stall , barely 24 hours after it had been vacated houston , the 12year veteran and knicks captain , retired monday , creating a leadership void that the 36yearold davis now hopes to fill he will start by filling houston s locker , a situation davis said was not a little strange it felt a lot strange davis added i'm honored , though i'm honored to be sitting in the position that a guy like that held hopefully , i can be that same type of leader with a wry smile , davis then said , of course , i ca n't shoot like him the knicks will settle for davis s rebounding , interior defense and wisdom , all of which are in short supply on a team that is young and not particularly gritty although he admitted to being both devastated and in shock when the chicago bulls traded him on oct 4 in the deal that also brought eddy curry to new york , davis said he was here to stay they want me here , i want to be here , davis said i'm excited to be in this locker room he said he was not seeking a buyout of his 138 million contract , nor would he ask to be waived the only request davis had of isiah thomas , the team president , and coach larry brown was to give him peace of mind he wanted to know that if he came to the knicks , if he uprooted his family and brought them to new york , that he would be here for the entire season it was a reasonable concern , given that the knicks are rebuilding with youth , and considering that davis s expiring contract makes him attractive trade bait davis said he was reassured on every count i had a great talk with larry , whom i love , said davis , who also played for brown in indiana and i had a great talk with isiah i just wanted to sit down with them and clear the air on a few things , so that i could fully embrace the situation without hesitation , davis said he had indeed embraced his new team and his new home and said he had one goal to get the knicks back to being the knicks that i know , which is winning and being competitive and always being a classact team davis said he grew excited as he and his family toured the team s westchester county training center and the surrounding area , checking out schools and neighborhoods davis and his wife , kendra , have 10yearold twins , kaela and aj i do n't go anywhere without them , davis said that was the reason the trade was so stressful you 're thinking about change , thinking about my kids , thinking about our foundation being disrupted , he said and there s a lot of mixed feelings none of it had anything to do with basketball or this city davis reported to training camp in charleston , sc , two days after the trade , but returned to chicago the next day when his motherinlaw needed surgery he remained there until monday , and the knicks feeling that davis was perhaps still hoping to get cut loose docked his pay for the first two exhibition games davis said he might talk to thomas about recouping the 251 , 000 in lost pay but his main concern now is to bring stability to a young team davis is already close to curry and the former bull jamal crawford , and will be a good tutor for the rookies channing frye and david lee the knicks have only four players who will be at least 30 on opening night davis , penny hardaway , jerome james and malik rose we lost timmy and kurt , brown said , referring to the unrelated thomases , and now with allan not being here , it s critical that you 've got some leadership from the players davis was on the bench , in suit and tie , for last night s preseason game against the philadelphia 76ers at madison square garden he expects to practice today and play in at least one of the four remaining preseason games i'm not in great shape , but i'm not in awful shape , davis said it may take me a couple of weeks , but once i get there , then there s no more excuses , let s get going with his combination of size , rebounding skills and defense , davis could win the starting job at power forward if they need me to play that type of role and start and do some of those things , that s definitely right up my alley , he said rebounds coach larry brown watched last night s game from the stands while herb williams coached the game but brown s health is fine , the team said it is an annual brown tradition to have his top assistant coach one preseason game in his place eddy curry scored 15 points and grabbed 3 rebounds as the knicks lost , 11499 , to the 76ers nate robinson added 16 points and 6 rebounds quentin richardson and jerome james sat out the game to rest strained hamstrings forwards maurice taylor and matt barnes each got his first start of the preseason malik rose and richardson started the first two games barnes was a late addition to the trainingcamp roster , but with the retirement of houston he now has a strong chance of making the final roster the knicks have 13 guaranteed contracts , with five free agents barnes , center jackie butler , forward otis george and guards steven barber and jamison brewer competing for two open roster spots
mirrors are everywhere you turn at the american barber institute in chelsea mirrors on walls mirrors on doors mirrors in the middle of the room row after row of mirrors , pingponging reflections back and forth for the narcissistic , this would be paradise for the selfconscious , this would be hell and for geovanny espaillat \? the vanity represented by those mirrors gives him a chance to reinvent himself , as a barber i'm not going to lie to you , said mr espaillat , 20 i was a bad kid i was a troublemaker when he was 5 years old , in the dominican republic , his native country , he grabbed a woman s backside from there , he said , all the family told my mom , 'he s going to be bad' after his immediate family moved to new york city , mr espaillat , when he was in fifth grade , was found to have a learning disability , which led to a cascade of problems at school what he 'd hear in class one day , the next day someone would ask him and he would n't remember , his mother , mayra fernandez , 47 , said in spanish he used to get very frustrated and he 'd start to cry her son attended three new york city high schools and finished none but he did manage to stay out of jail why was he a troublemaker \? he sheepishly smiled to show off in front of the girls , mr espaillat said his eyes crinkle at the thought of the beauties who populate new york city it s easy to sidle up to them in the mall , on the train , on the street , with the opening how are you doing \? my name is geovanny what is your name \? he prided himself on his game once when he was at queens center mall with a friend , he saw a cute girl looking at him he bragged to his friend , she s looking at me , dude , watch out , and he approached her with a smooth voice and a cocked head , mr espaillat said you look very good you look decent i like your shoes the girl looked at him and said , i was n't looking at you i was looking at your boy that was four years ago he s still with her today , mr espaillat said , laughing about a year ago , mr espaillat realized that the no 1 woman in his life was his mother , who had raised four sons by herself while working as a home attendant mom is going to be the only one that is going to be there when you get locked up , said mr espaillat , who still lives at home in far rockaway , queens i'm trying to help my mom out , he said i adore my mom i love my mom to death she s the one who brought me to this country she put me in school she is the one that raised me she bought me all my clothes to return her love , he decided to attend the american barber institute so he could get a job she s very happy that i'm doing something , mr espaillat said i told her i got 3 for tips for my first time and she was happy for it he s very good to me , ms fernandez said i'm very happy and proud while mr espaillat received a federal pell grant to cover most of the 2 , 700 tuition , however , he was 400 short , so he dropped out , with his training halfdone for a time , his goal , tantalizingly , seemed just beyond his reach but the brooklyn bureau of community service came to his aid the bureau had provided him with job counseling one of the seven charitable agencies supported by the new york times neediest cases fund , it reached into that fund for 248 to help mr espaillat return to school , and he came up with the rest today , mr espaillat projects his game onto each man in his barber chair , with his scissors and razors i want to make his day , he said i think to myself , he is probably getting a haircut because he wants to look good for a girl previously recorded 2 , 804 , 75649 recorded thursday 110 , 03521 total 2 , 914 , 79170 last year to date 3 , 171 , 77336 how to help checks payable to the new york times neediest cases fund should be sent to 4 chase metrotech center , 7th floor east , lockbox 5193 , brooklyn , ny 11245 , or any of these organizations brooklyn bureau of community service 285 schermerhorn street brooklyn , ny 11217 catholic charities , diocese of brooklyn and queens 191 joralemon street brooklyn , ny 11201 catholic charities of the archdiocese of new york 1011 first avenue new york , ny 10022 children s aid society 105 east 22nd street new york , ny 10010 community service society of new york 105 east 22nd street new york , ny 10010 federation of protestant welfare agencies 281 park avenue south new york , ny 10010 ujafederation of new york church street station po box 4100 new york , ny 102614100 no agents or solicitors are authorized to seek contributions for the new york times neediest cases fund donations may be made with a credit card by phone at \( 800 \) 3810075 or online , courtesy of nycharitiesorg , an internet donations service , at www nytimes com neediest or www nycharities org neediest for instructions on how to donate stock to the fund , call \( 212 \) 5561137 or fax \( 212 \) 5564450 the times pays the fund s expenses , so all contributions go directly to the charities , which use them to provide services and cash assistance to the poor contributions to the fund are deductible on federal , state and city income taxes to the extent permitted by law to delay may mean to forget photo geovanny espaillat practiced on a fellow student , luciano moriera , on tuesday at the american barber institute , on west 29th street \( photo by andrea mohin the new york times \)

often visits the model , laser pointer in hand , with people to whom he is trying to sell his dream for willets point here s my favorite part , mr oats says as his pointer circles the green patch of parkland before settling on the triangle between the bowlsize model of shea stadium and the fanciful blue of flushing bay you can see how it s one contiguous park shea stadium s there the marina s there there s la guardia then all of a sudden , a nongreen area it s as if you took central park and carved a huge corner out of it mr oats has nothing against the business owners in willets point what bothers him is that the land on which they operate was supposed to be part of flushing meadows , home of the mets and the us open tennis tournament and the site of two world s fairs but because of the machinations of the master builder robert moses and the oratorical skills of a young lawyer named mario m cuomo , a strategically located part of queens onetenth the size of central park became a junkyard , a veritable wall of concrete , oil and scrap metal that prevents development along the flushing waterfront on a clear day , the stretch of car repair shops , scrap metal depots and waste treatment plants resembles nothing so much as a scene from the road warrior the thoroughfares are blistered with holes like the surface of the moon , and the wind churns up clouds of dust that blow through 70 acres of scrap metal , mounds of contaminated earth and abandoned cars of every description for nearly 40 years , successive waves of developers , dreamers and neighborhood activists have been drawn to willets point , eager to tame the frontier and make it their own , perhaps because the challenge it represents is so awesome now another wave of interest is on the horizon , a reflection of mayor bloomberg s plan to develop regional economic centers in the boroughs outside manhattan as soaring real estate costs in manhattan have led developers to look outside the city the city has already spent millions on downtown brooklyn and jamaica , queens then , earlier this year , it took out advertisements in real estate magazines touting the potential of willets point and began courting potential developers for it mr oats also sees an opportunity for willets point in the form of the city s 2012 olympic bid , specifically the olympic stadium that mayor bloomberg has been seeking to build on the west side of manhattan mr oats envisions an olympic stadium that would transform willets point , though the clock is ticking on such a dream while the stadium remains mired in the politics of the current mayoral race , an international olympic committee delegation is scheduled to make a nonbinding recommendation from among the five competing bids early next month , and the full committee will select the host city on july 6 downtown flushing is the city s fourthlargest retail hub , and in a city starved for waterfronts , the flushing river might be expected to draw developers like a magnet instead , its vista of willets point repulses them though willets point business owners describe the iron triangle as a flourishing business district , developers and politicians say the area is an eyesore and a warren of illegal activity are you going to go to the bankers and say , 'mr banker , i want you to invest some money in a property that has a view of a pile of junk' \? asks wellington chen , senior vice president at tdc development , a company that owns land across the river no one s going to invest a dime in this area unless there s hope that something better will be on the horizon messy , necessary since 1951 , three generations of the sambucci family have run an auto salvage business in willets point their office , a twostory prefab building on 36th avenue with a view of shea stadium , is decorated with bumper stickers , pinup cartoons of 1960 s models and an autographed photo of the first president bush customers , many on a firstname basis , walk in and announce the makes and models of their cars and the parts they need sammy sambucci jr , who possesses what customers describe as an encyclopedic knowledge of cars , searches for them in his computer if he does n't have a part , he sends the customer to a garage down the street the sambuccis also salvage usable parts from cars a luxurymodel engine , for example , can fetch more than 2 , 500 the rest goes to scrapmetal dealers danny sambucci jr , a cousin , says the shop makes 2 for every 100 pounds of scrap metal our business is a messy business , but it s a necessary evil , danny jr says there are cars all over the streets you need people to get rid of them but less and less is this an easy place for the sambuccis to conduct a business , even one like this the roads have become so bad that a garbage truck once became stuck in a pothole now the only time the garbage truck comes is before the mets' opening day junkyard operators often get rid of garbage by throwing it into stripped cars they pave their own sidewalks , and plow snow themselves , and their phones go dead when it rains although the sambuccis pay nearly 80 , 000 a year in property taxes , the area lacks sanitary sewers try finding a bathroom and the storm sewers on willets point boulevard have collapsed among the bumper stickers that decorate the sambuccis' counter , several indicate their view of government if it ai n't broke , fix it 'til it is the government s philosophy , one says another do n't steal , that s the government s job put it to you this way , danny jr says if this property were anyplace else i have an acre and a half what do you think an acre and a half is worth in flushing \? millions what about in corona \? millions so we 're in between flushing and corona but despite a decade of soaring real estate values in new york , the sambuccis say , the appraised value of their land has remained stagnant , around 300 , 000 we are an asset to the city , and they do n't know it , says danny sambucci sr , who began the business anywhere else you could borrow probably millions we wanted to borrow 500 , 000 we could n't get it this land has a stigmatism , danny jr says then he adds with a laugh we 're not against them developing property just not our property besides , he adds , if the city gave willets point to someone who wanted to build a shopping mall , where would the current businesses go \? this is m31 zoning , heavy industrial , danny jr says there s none left go on a map look they say you 're going to move me i tell you what , tell me where you 're going to move me if i like the spot , i 'll move right now the land of fishhooks mccarthy the saga of new york s last frontier began in the early 20th century , when a tammany hall politician known as fishhooks mccarthy gained control over 1 , 200 acres of swamps and meadowlands on the banks of the flushing river , an area known as flushing meadows mccarthy turned the land into a giant dump for his brooklyn ash removal company , which filled it with so much garbage that in one area the trash formed a 90foot high mountain of ashes , nicknamed mount corona f scott fitzgerald immortalized the dump in the great gatsby , using it as the symbolic dividing line between the masses of new york and the grandees of long island fitzgerald called it a valley of ashes a fantastic farm where ashes grow like wheat into ridges and hills and grotesque gardens moses conquered the dump in stages in 1935 he drove part of the grand central parkway straight through mount corona he then paved over the dump to build the grounds for the 1939 world s fair , although not until the 1960 s , with the arrival of a second world s fair , was the park completed but when moses moved to incorporate willets point into his plan , the junkyard owners pooled their money and hired mr cuomo to defend them in court mr cuomo argued eloquently on their behalf , and moses was barred from using state money to buy the land in 1991 , the city s public development corporation released a plan that called for rezoning parts of the triangle to lure new businesses and , implicitly , drive out the junkyards a decade , two more planning studies , and an international brownfield remediation workshop later , the city government finally got involved and invited developers to submit plans for redeveloping 48 acres of willets point \( the rest of the peninsula , owned by the long island rail road and the metropolitan transportation authority , is currently off the table \) the timing may be opportune this attempt at development has the support of a broad consensus of city officials and flushing community leaders and in a change from the past , willets point s businesses are not united in their efforts to fight it the first stage of the process is a request for expressions of interest , or an rfei , in which the city seeks ideas from developers before it asks a select few of them to submit more detailed proposals in january , the city played host to an information session at flushing town hall to explain the rfei to developers about 90 people from 53 organizations attended , among them tiffany lau , a land acquisition analyst from pulte homes , a developer with offices in jersey city ms lau did n't know much about the point , but she was intrigued by ads the city had placed in a real estate journal promising developers a chance to build on what seemed like a prime piece of real estate , 48 acres in the heart of queens it sounded too good to be true it was perhaps most important , the quality of the environment in willets point had deteriorated significantly over the past halfcentury because of its use as a waste transfer station and the frequent dumping of petroleum and other autorelated chemicals a study the city released the following month showed potential contamination at nearly every site , mostly in spilled petroleum , paint and cleaning solvents the solidity of the land under the junkyards was another issue beneath the layer of compacted trash and coal ash that was bulldozed for the first world s fair sat a layer of swamp , which meant that anything constructed in willets point would have to sit on steel piles driven deep into the ground , to keep foundations from buckling as the ground shifted below most distressing of all for the developers , officials of the city s economic development corporation told them not to count on using the principle of eminent domain , which allows the government to acquire property if a public purpose is involved , to wrest the 48acre parcel from its current owners and occupants although daunted by the area s obvious drawbacks , ms lau was eager to get a closer look so right after the presentation , she hopped on the no 7 train and took it to the willets point shea stadium stop she saw no sign of the van that the city had promised to send to ferry potential developers to the site this day , but she did see david lefevre of beacon properties , another interested developer , and together they headed along roosevelt avenue willets point is a twominute walk along roosevelt avenue , underneath the thundering tracks of the el the main thoroughfare , willets point boulevard , which originates at roosevelt avenue and 126th street , was intended to be a grand avenue , like broadway in manhattan or the grand concourse in the bronx , running continuously to fort totten , four miles northeast today , the mouth of the boulevard is flanked by ga tire shop on one side , and aa auto glass and the naciones unidas muffler and tire shop on the other farther along , on both sides of the street , are stacks of shiny wheel rims on metal shelves , followed by more rim shops , body shops and auto glass dealers , all operating out of metal shacks , many bearing signs painted in bright primary colors the whir of pneumatic tools , the clang of metal parts and the shouts of workers drown out the techno blasting from a garage further up the road the modernday willets point boulevard is many things a parking lot , an outdoor conference center , a place for fixing cars , a place where you can nap on a milk crate but it is no grand avenue motorists guide their vehicles gingerly across its gutted tarmac dodging puddles and oil slicks in her dress shoes and long , creamcolored wool coat , ms lau found it slow going she managed to cover about 100 yards before she and mr lefevre stopped and stared , dumbstruck , at the scene around them it looked as if a chunk of a thirdworld city like calcutta had been scooped up workers , dusty cars , chickens and all and then deposited thousands of miles away next to shea stadium intimidated , they decided to head back , though they said they would return , wearing boots and jeans , and , they hoped , riding in a car i definitely felt worse about it than my initial impression , ms lau wrote in an email message recounting her brief visit seeing just how bad the roads were , and how haphazardly the various shops' had been set up , as well as the number of men just hanging around looking for business , i definitely did n't want to stay there , nor could i envision 'treelined streets' or 'pedestrianscale residential and retail development' there it is not a welcoming place , especially for a pedestrian or a woman , for that matter it was , she wrote , almost as if you were walking into gangcontrolled territory the sputtering pace of progress two months later , ms lau had not returned to willets point although 10 or so developers represented at the january meeting had submitted proposals to the city , her company was growing wary of spending the several thousand dollars necessary to produce a master plan on thursday , janel patterson , a spokeswoman for the economic development corporation , wrote in an email message that her organization had received a number of very exciting and dynamic proposals from developers in response to the rfei , adding that the quantity and quality of these responses are good indications of the area s development potential even once a developer is selected , a process the edc said will take several months , the tasks ahead will be formidable some developers have predicted that simply acquiring the land and cleaning up the site could take 10 years and cost more than 100 million studies in the 90 s by the queens borough president s office and what is now the edc estimated that repairing the streets and sewers could cost 26 million to 36 million to many of those who have been following the decadeslong debate over the future of willets point , all this talk represents a kind of kabuki theater the sambuccis seem resigned to the fact that the threat of condemnation will hover perpetually over their heads , depressing land values and denying them basic services to tell you the truth , it s not going to happen that quickly , danny sambucci jr says of the prospect of redevelopment and , to tell you the truth , if it does n't happen soon , i do n't think it s going to happen at all
even though you 've been waiting for it , the first squawk is still a shocker stephen temperley s souvenir , the sweet but nonetooshort love letter of a play that opened last night at the lyceum theater , is a portrait of a lady who became a legend for singing badly , after all for her to make anything approaching a pretty sound would be blasphemy to the cultists who continue to worship at the shrine of the real woman named florence foster jenkins \( 18681944 \) yet there s no ignoring the jolt of the first fully sung note delivered by judy kaye as mrs jenkins , a socialite who set elite eardrums in manhattan atrembling in a series of notorious private concerts from 1912 until the year she died up to this point , ms kaye s florence has registered as an easily pigeonholed cousin to the dithery but solemn , pearlwearing dowagers of 1930 s film comedies , like margaret dumont , groucho marx s favorite foil , and mary boland yet when she plunges into the crystalline waters of the aria caro nome from verdi s rigoletto , ms kaye executes the aural equivalent of a belly flop , the twoton kind that empties a swimming pool the brutal sound that has just erupted from her has no discernible relation to this woman s matronly , carefully groomed mien the noise is so loud , so abrasive that it is remarkable that the audience s stunned boom of laughter comes close to drowning it out and there you have the entire artistic career of florence foster jenkins in a single sound bite \( or sound chomp , if you prefer \) mrs jenkins , who died in her mid70 s a month after making her carnegie hall debut to a soldout house , exists in the footnotes of cultural history as a perfectly selfcontained walking joke , rather like the american idol reject william hung her appearance was the setup her voice was the punch line that souvenir , directed by vivian matalon and also starring donald corren , emerges as more than a freak show has to do with its author s heartfelt insistence on moving beyond the punch line \( he is not the only writer to have been so inspired another play based on mrs jenkins s life , peter quilter s glorious ! , opened earlier this month in london , starring maureen lipman \) the investigative empathy of mr temperley , ms kaye and mr corren , who portrays mrs jenkins s longtime accompanist , turns the first act of souvenir into an unexpectedly gentle and affecting comedy more s the pity that the second act comes close to erasing its previously accumulated good will as its title suggests , souvenir is a memory play it is framed by the recollections of a tart sentimentalist performing in a piano bar in 1964 that s the implausibly named cosme mcmoon \( mr corren \) , an aging gay blade who spent much of his youth playing the melodies to the songs with which mrs jenkins had her willful way in rehearsals and in concert people used to say to me , 'why does she do it \? , ' says cosme , in a disarming opening monologue , of his employer s selffinanced recitals i always thought the better question was , 'why did i \? ' and it s cosme s changing perspective on mrs jenkins , whom we first meet when he interviews for a job with her , that gives the play its glimmers of breadth and depth for souvenir and this is a kindness turns out to be less a simulation of a fabulously terrible singer than a portrait of a relationship stories about young men receiving lifeaffirming lessons from wacky older women are usually to be avoided \( remember the 2003 broadway flop six dance lessons in six weeks \? \) but in charting the phases of cosme s years with madame flo , souvenir casts a softly illuminating light on the fascination that many gay men have with women classically described as camp it s not the sniggering side of this enthrallment that the play emphasizes , but something more tender an amused but sincere admiration for the valiant excesses of women who refuse to accept their limitations , whether of old age , ugliness or , in mrs jenkins s case , unconditional tone deafness mr corren captures this ambivalent , respectful sensibility with engaging ease as cosme considers his mixed motives for staying with mrs jenkins and his growing acceptance of her absolute faith in herself , mr corren avoids limpwristed caricature and easy laughs seeing mrs jenkins through cosme s clear but loving eyes is an essential optical aid for the audience ms kaye , a tony winner \( for the phantom of the opera \) and longtime favorite of broadway insiders , blossoms nobly within this framework mrs jenkins was a monomaniac , which means that she is essentially a onenote character , however many musical notes she may mangle but ms kaye strikes that single note of personality with a happy mixture of ardor , unblinking obliviousness and \( you should pardon the expression \) pitchperfect period detail as much as the costumes she wears \( by tracy christensen \) , her stance and gestures are exactly of mrs jenkins s time and place \( watch her clasp her throat when cosme warns her of vocal strain \) she also delivers the trademark jenkins voice , which is not so far from what you hear on recordings , with an enthusiasm and conviction that makes her more than an object of rude sport but it s what happens around those bursts of sour song that keeps souvenir on this side of shrillness mr matalon paces the first act with a touchingly graceful restraint that matches mr temperley s writing the scene in which cosme finally loses his temper with mrs jenkins is a winning blend of artifice and earnestness so is the jaunty reconciliation , set to the strains of the 1920 s pop standard crazy rhythm in the second act , most of it devoted to mrs jenkins s appearance at carnegie hall , souvenir turns into what it had previously and mercifully avoided a succession of fragments from arias delivered in bad voice and outrageous costumes this is the stuff of drag shows , though ms kaye remains resolutely true to her character and the postperformance scenes between cosme and mrs jenkins , as well as the final number , feel cheaply and artificially sentimental souvenir , which has already developed a fond following from previous incarnations by the york theater company in manhattan and at the berkshire theater festival , would probably be guaranteed a long and healthy life in a more intimate , cabaretlike space whether it was advisable to throw it onto broadway is questionable it s not that ms kaye and mr corren get lost in a big house they do n't but they and the script wind up having to reach for big comic and tearjerking effects that rip the play s finespun charm for the first 80 minutes or so , they are lovely company but like the obsessed woman it celebrates , souvenir does n't know when to leave the stage souvenir by stephen temperley directed by vivian matalon sets by r michael miller costumes by tracy christensen lighting by ann g wrightson sound by david budries musical supervision , tom helm production stage manager , jack gianino production manager , showman fabricators general manager , roy gabay presented by ted snowdon , in arrangement with the york theater company at the lyceum theater , 149 west 45th street \( 212 \) 2396200 running time 2 hours 15 minutes with judy kaye \( florence foster jenkins \) and donald corren \( cosme mcmoon \)

what may once have been true of a porsche is certainly true of new york city s fleet of subway trains and buses there is no substitute but with a strike possible in just three days , officials of the region s other transit providers are scrambling to fill in some of the gaps commuter railroads and bus services , ferry operators and the port authority of new york and new jersey have drawn up contingency plans to reduce the chaos a transit strike would create but none have the flexibility or the resources to do much more than help out on the margins the port authority plans a special run of path trains from the world trade center station in lower manhattan to 33rd street in midtown but the route would involve looping under the hudson river through jersey city for two stops , then back under the hudson and up the west side the trip would take more than 20 minutes , compared with 10 to 12 minutes on the subway the metronorth railroad is planning to operate shuttles from grand central terminal to its stations in the bronx , charging a oneway fare of 3 the long island rail road , which like metronorth is a subsidiary of the metropolitan transportation authority , plans to run similar shuttles from pennsylvania station to jamaica , queens , stopping at several stations along the way providing the additional service would inconvenience the railroads' regular customers because it would require the cancellation of some trains and the shortening of others representatives of the railroads and the transportation authority declined to comment yesterday , ahead of an announcement planned for today we 're working to utilize whatever existing mass transit there is , said jarrod bernstein , a spokesman for the city s office of emergency management , which is coordinating the contingency plans those proposals were still being pulled together yesterday but some city officials were critical of the response from city hall , saying that it is less robust than the preparations three years ago for the last threatened strike the 2005 contingency plan is nothing more than a 'lite' version of the 2002 contingency plan , said john c liu , chairman of the city council s transportation committee last time , just 15 months after the sept 11 terrorist attack , more of the pieces were in place to help cope with a transit shutdown , mr liu said the city still had limitations on cars entering the city during rush hours and it had increased ferry service it hired new york waterway , the largest ferry operator in the region , to draw up plans to carry commuters from manhattan to docks in brooklyn and queens new york waterway chartered 31 additional boats ferry operators , who have struggled to turn a profit with the increase of gas prices , said that this time the city had declined to add boats at the moment , the only ferry service to manhattan from brooklyn or queens operates during rush hours from the brooklyn army terminal in bay ridge to pier 11 near wall street new york water taxi suspended its service on the east river a month ago , but plans to resume in the spring in late october , the service was drawing only 122 roundtrip passengers on average per day and was losing 800 a day , the company s president , tom fox , wrote in a letter to customers last week if there is a strike , mr fox said yesterday , the company will operate as many boats as it can from the brooklyn army terminal , which has a 500space parking lot , to pier 11 new york waterway does not intend to offer additional service , though it does expect more passengers , said pat smith , a spokesman planned restrictions on driving into the city could cause commuters to switch to buses and trains or join car pools thomas r suozzi , the nassau county executive , is scheduled to announce today arrangements for long island commuters to park and then ride trains or meet to form car pools the long island rail road and metronorth each would cancel as many as a dozen trains each weekday , and some scheduled trains would skip stops in the bronx and queens , to accommodate the shuttles new jersey transit had no plans to provide additional service on its buses or trains , but would redeploy some of its employees to help commuters navigate the system during a strike , a spokeswoman said
san francisco , march 16 the phone lines are seldom quiet for long at the nonprofit identity theft resource center but lately they have been ringing almost continually the calls come from people like warren lambert , who phoned on feb 18 , the same day he received a letter conveying alarming news from choicepoint , a company that compiles data on millions of citizens it was only one of more than 140 , 000 such letters choicepoint has mailed in recent weeks , informing people like mr lambert that computer files containing their names , addresses and social security numbers , among other critical personal data , had been inadvertently sold to several individuals , posing as legitimate business customers mr lambert , a 67yearold retiree living in san francisco , called the identity theft hotline to ask not only what immediate steps he should take but , more important , what i'm going to be exposed to the immediate steps were clear , according to jay foley , who with his wife , linda , runs the id theft counseling center from their home in san diego mr lambert needed to phone the three major credit reporting agencies to find out if any credit cards or other accounts had been opened in his name none had , so far and then place a fraud alert on his accounts , to warn potential creditors not to open additional accounts in mr lambert s name without fuller verification but mr lambert also needed to understand that the privacy breach meant he now had something similar to an incurable virus a chronic condition he would need to monitor for the rest of his life once a person knows your name and social security number , mr foley said , what , short of killing that person or lobotomizing them , is going to prevent them from digging out a file with that information and going to town on you , whether a year down the road or in 10 years \? mr foley says he dreads contemplating the trouble that mr lambert and tens of thousands of other americans may be exposed to as a result of recently disclosed leaks of personal information from choicepoint , lexisnexis and possibly bank of america the foleys have taken too many calls in recent years from the estimated 32 million americans that the federal trade commission says are victims of identity theft in this country each year people who are financially defrauded or even charged with crimes as a result of someone else s assuming their identities the thousands of identity theft victims the foleys say they have counseled include an indiana woman whose bank account was drained by a thief who had somehow gained access to her social security number there was a family in modesto , calif , who learned only months after the fact that someone had taken a second mortgage on their home and there is the nevada man bedeviled by a criminal , presumably still at large , who has used his personal data to take up temporary residence in a 35 million home in boca raton , fla , and buy a ferrari , a porsche and a mercedes in his name statistically , based on the ftc estimate , every 10 seconds another person in this country becomes the victim of an identity theft and privacyrights advocates warn that unless new safeguards are put on the massive consumer databases that have grown up in recent years , the rate of fraud can only increase identity thieves can operate with remarkable efficiency as they work to enrich themselves using the good name and credit of others instead of oldfashioned methods like dumpsterdiving or sifting through the mail in search of credit card applications with people s personal information , sophisticated criminals are taking aim at the trove of personal files that data compilers like choicepoint and lexisnexis , a unit of the reed elsevier group , have amassed on millions of citizens in recent years a day does not go by where i do n't spend time working the phone talking to credit agencies and the like , said mr lambert , the san francisco retiree mainly , he said he had spent a lot of time worrying another recent recipient of a choicepoint letter , mary chapman , has a different reaction to the efforts she taken to check whether anyone has committed criminal mischief in her name i would n't describe myself as nervous so much as angry , said ms chapman , an outofwork former federal employee who lives in yreka , calif i'm extremely angry choicepoint , based in alpharetta , ga , has suspended most sales of consumer information to small businesses and has created an independent office of credentialing , compliance and privacy in an effort to plug holes in its data security system the company has also offered those receiving a notification letter one year of free credit monitoring lexisnexis , of dayton , ohio , which announced its data security problem last week , has said it is notifying all 30 , 000 affected individuals and also offering them a year s worth of credit monitoring the consumer backlash from the recent spate of database security lapses has brought unflattering publicity to an industry that had grown up quietly over the last decade , governed by only a thin patchwork of laws and regulations that mainly let the data compilers police themselves but members of congress have been galvanized and are calling for tighter controls and tougher consumer safeguards , and several bills have been introduced in the house and senate , with more expected in congressional hearings last thursday and this past tuesday , lawmakers grilled witnesses from the federal trade commission and the database industry over the accuracy of the information being bought and sold , and whether enough was being done by data brokers and the government to protect consumer privacy i think that after we hold this hearing , rep joe barton , republican of texas , said at tuesday s hearing before a house subcommittee , we 're going to have to make a decision whether we need to set some national standards about what can be traded when for the foleys in san diego , who scrape by on foundation grants , dispensing free advice and support from a spare bedroom in their house , the problem of identity theft is hardly a new issue the couple , who are in their 50 s , started the identity theft resource center after ms foley grappled with the effects of having her identity hijacked in 1997 by an employer who used her social security number and other vital information to obtain three credit cards in her name and sign a contract with a cellphone provider she was living quite nicely on my social security number , said ms foley , a former restaurant reviewer while trying to sort it all out , i basically crawled into bed and pulled the cover over my head and wished the world would just go away , she said you argue with the credit issuers , she said you argue with the credit reporting agencies , you argue with the collection agencies every time , you 're reopening the wound and telling your story again until maybe eventually they might believe you nowadays , the foleys , a small staff and a team of 75 volunteers around the country help those who learn they are the victim of an identity theft negotiate that same nameless , faceless bureaucracy of credit card companies , banks , law enforcement agencies and collection firms basically i start answering the phone at 6 30 in the morning , and linda joins me at about 9 , said mr foley , who was a salesman before the id theft center became his fulltime job and we basically answer them until 7 or 8 o'clock at night companies that compile consumer data often argue that the threat of identity fraud linked to computer databases and the internet has been overstated a recent survey by the better business bureau and javelin strategy research , which was financed by visa usa , wells fargo bank and checkfree , concluded that a family member , friend , neighbor or inhouse employee was responsible for half the reported identity theft cases but the choicepoint fraud was conducted by thieves who pretended to be legitimate business customers of the data service , who were given login access to the company s online databases so far , only a single person , a nigerian man in los angeles , has pleaded guilty to his role in the fraud , but investigators say they believe others were involved it has still not been determined what happened in an incident involving a bank of america computer tape containing the files of more than a million customers that the bank recently said had disappeared and lexisnexis is still trying to figure out how one or more unauthorized people obtained the passwords that gave them online access to 30 , 000 consumers' digital dossiers regardless of how someone s identity is commandeered , the result can be endless hours trying to clear one s name brent james of mesa , ariz , still has no idea why he started receiving calls from a collection agency in 2000 , hounding him about a student loan in default i 've never even had a student loan , mr james said although he thought he had cleared up the matter years ago , he still receives periodic calls from bill collectors seeking payment for the loan then in october , he learned that these occasional phone calls were the least of his worries someone had entered into two cellphone contracts and bought a car in his name and though mr james and his wife have owned a home since 2000 , he also has multiple personal judgments against me by landlords suing over a broken lease people tell me the civil judgments are the hardest to get off your credit report , mr james said basically you need to hire a lawyer and go to court in each case meanwhile , the phone calls continue to the foleys' hot line , more of them in recent weeks so many , at times , that the couple and their threeperson staff cannot handle the load callers often get a busy signal to those who do get through , mr foley imparts a harsh but simple message there s lots of ways this hurts you that you ca n't even begin to imagine until it happens to you
two american league teams , texas and baltimore , had threefourths of their infields at the allstar game one national league team , st louis , would have had threefourths of its infield there had scott rolen not withdrawn because of a troublesome shoulder none of the infielders had reason to say to any of their teammates , funny seeing you here they are all good players who earned their spots in detroit , whether by the fans' vote or the vote of players , managers and coaches , and they are largely responsible for their teams' presence in division races texas had mark teixeira , alfonso soriano and michael young in detroit only hank blalock was at home baltimore had brian roberts , miguel tejada \( the game s most valuable player \) and melvin mora there only rafael palmeiro was missing albert pujols and david eckstein represented st louis even though rolen was absent , and they sent postcards to mark grudzielanek saying , having a great time wish you were here teixeira and tejada each hit a home run and drove in two runs in the game , which was appropriate behavior because they lead their teams in homers and runs batted in but teixeira is also part of the most productive infield in the major leagues first baseman teixeira , second baseman soriano , shortstop young and third baseman blalock began the postallstar part of the season with 76 home runs and 233 runs batted in the orioles' foursome had 64 homers and 208 rbi teixeira , with 25 home runs , was the american league leader , and his 73 rbi were among the league leaders a switchhitter who spent only one year in the minors , teixeira is in his third major league season and has increased his production each season last year he went from 26 to 38 home runs and from 84 to 112 rbi every year i want to get better as a hitter and as a player , teixeira said i'm only 25 years old each year i want to improve and this is part of the improvement blalock , whose presence prompted the rangers to shift teixeira from third base to first , is 24 years old , young 28 and soriano 29 young switched to shortstop from second base last year after the rangers traded alex rodriguez to the yankees we can be as good as we want to be , teixeira said that infield has as much talent as anyone in baseball we have four allstars we have guys that can possibly win gold gloves the sky s the limit for that infield the infielders feed off each other , teixeira said those guys push me , he said when they go out and have good games , that makes me want to go out and do the same when they make a nice play , it makes me want to go out and make a nice play also i think we definitely feed off each other , especially hitting consecutively in the order young , the lone 300 hitter among the infielders , echoed his teammate s assessment i think we all push each other , he said we take a lot of pride in being productive players for our team it s something we love to do we love to go out there and swing the bat and hit for the most part we all hit in the same four spots in the order we hit back to back to back to back we really enjoy playing with each other young bats second in the lineup , teixeira third , blalock fourth and soriano fifth we never really talk about anything that we 've accomplished , young said we talk about trying to improve there are always ways to get better this year the biggest thing we wanted to improve was defense from the start of spring training until now , that s something we put a great deal of work into we take a lot of pride in our defense , and i think it shows it has shown this season blalock , who last season made 17 errors , made only one before the allstar game break teixeira , with 10 last season , had made two errors young was down to 5 from 19 a year ago soriano , who had 23 last year , had committed 13 guys are working at it , teixeira said , discussing the defense michael young is in only his second year playing shortstop for us he s a great shortstop already this is only my third year playing first base , and i think i'm getting better hank blalock s one of the best defensive third basemen in the game , and alfonso soriano s getting better , so we 're all trying to work at it and it s working out anderson is at his best pinchhitting marlon anderson took a few weeks off from his regular job recently , but when he went back to it , he found he was still the best at what he does because of injuries , the mets had to use anderson at second base , depriving themselves of the national league s best pinchhitter entering the weekend , anderson had not batted for anybody since june 17 nevertheless his 13 hits and 419 pinchhitting average were the league s best why has he become an exceptional pinchhitter \? i think it s an acceptance of the role , anderson said for me , it s accepting my role and what i am and what i need to do for this team at this time not worry about myself in different situations i could do this , i could be playing here , i could be doing this , why is this guy playing \? so what \? you just go out and do whatever you have to do to help the team it s a remarkable view of oneself in a very selfish game , but it has worked for the 31yearold anderson with st louis last season , his first as a pinchhitter , he tied for first with 17 hits and batted 333 \( 17 for 51 \) , second to terrence long s 340 \( 17 for 50 \) i do n't look at it as pinchhitting , anderson said i look at it as an opportunity to help the team nor does he have a problem being a pinchhitter instead of being a regular when you do something good , how can it be bad for you \? he said willie knows what i can do , anderson added , referring to manager willie randolph he understands what i bring to the team when he needs me in different situations , he s going to have me i'm not going to complain about what i do or what i do n't get to do we 're all men and understand the situation , and you just take advantage of the situation you 're given , no matter what that may be milton faster with his homerun pitch the cincinnati reds should be pleased with their signing of eric milton as a free agent in december they gave milton , a 29yearold lefthander , 255 million for three years , and he has given them exactly what they saw him give philadelphia last season homer headaches last season milton led the national league in home runs allowed , 43 this season he leads the league again , having allowed 29 but he has given them up more frequently , one every three and twothirds innings compared with one every four and twothirds innings last year he also has a far worse record , 410 with a 692 earned run average , compared with 146 , 475 for the phillies what a difference a game makes it s all in the perspective a year ago the houston astros reached the allstar game with a 4444 record , and jimy williams was fired as manager this year the astros reached the allstar game with a 4443 record , and they were excited that they were back in the race , at least the wildcard race phil garner , who replaced williams and won the wild card , is n't going anywhere according to elias sports bureau , the astros are one of two teams this season \( oakland is the other \) and five in history to go from 15 games below 500 to 500 or better by the allstar game the astros , whose secondhalf record last season was 4826 , sank to 1530 on may 24 this season , then reeled off a 2913 record before the break the biggest thing is our young players did n't believe we could do it coming out of spring training , said roy oswalt , the team s pitching leader with 12 victories , six in his last six starts entering yesterday s game against st louis we had some big guys out of the lineup , berky and baggy , he added , meaning lance berkman and jeff bagwell the young guys did n't think they could pull the weight but last month , the last two months , the way we 've been playing , the guys believe in themselves once guys believe in themselves , they can do a lot of things recalling the astros' experience a year ago , oswalt said , last year s comeback was amazing because it came down to one game at the end of the year , where this year we can make up the ground before we get to the last day setting the record straight , at last year s break the astros were four and a half games behind san francisco in the wildcard race , and this season they were five games behind atlanta no closing statement for schilling although curt schilling s closing tenure is expected to be far shorter than john smoltz s , which lasted more than three seasons and resulted in 154 saves , smoltz declined to offer advice he does n't need any advice , just like roger clemens would n't , like randy johnson would n't , if they had to do the same thing , said smoltz , who is starting for atlanta again these are pitchers who are prepared to pitch better than most people i think curt takes it to a top level when he talks about starting and the emphasis he puts on everybody s weakness this is an opportunity to do what he thinks is best for himself and the organization to compete for another championship smoltz spoke before schilling squandered his first save opportunity for the red sox against the yankees on thursday night
the players , a jumpy group of 16and 17yearold boys from around the country , arrived at the headfirst baseball camp last month in ruther glen , va , with statistics that stood out it was not just their batting averages these were players who scored , on average , 1 , 300 out of a possible 1 , 600 on the twopart college board exam most of the 165 players were aminus students , and all wore identical white tshirts , with only numbers stenciled on their backs to tell them apart the campers tolerated the cattlecall atmosphere at the virginia sports complex just north of richmond because of the potential payoff 30 college coaches , many representing elite liberal arts colleges and ivy league universities , were scouting players among them was dave beccaria of haverford college , a small liberal arts college outside philadelphia that is one of the most selective in the country and which has agreed to give the new york times access to its recruiting process through the academic year beccaria has been in touch with more than 1 , 000 high school players since the beginning of the year , most of them juniors when the process started he initiated contact with many , but others sent email messages to him , some sent professionally made videos showing them in action and a few hired recruiting services to promote them almost all joined the summerlong tour of showcase camps like the one in virginia by the time the recruiting cycle is complete , beccaria figures six to eight of those players will join his team at haverford , a college that competes in division iii , requires ivy leaguecaliber academic scores and does not offer athletic scholarships as the competition for admission to highly rated colleges like haverford continues to escalate , the playing fields of america are becoming an ever bigger part of that process high school students and their parents are looking for any edge , and an athletic r sum is seen as the extra ingredient that can get a student s name on the precious list that the athletic department gives to its admissions office each year that list can include as few as a dozen names in one sport , with perhaps half expected to be admitted , although there are no guarantees still , with select institutions routinely rejecting 7 of 10 applicants over all , parents and their children relish the odds given listed athletes for coaches , the key is deciding whose names to write on the list haverford is typical of the toptier liberal arts colleges , academically and athletically the college ranked eighth in the liberal arts category of the most recent us news and world report rankings nearly 40 percent of students play a varsity sport and its athletic director , greg kannerstein , said that athletics played some role in the admission of about 15 percent of each recent incoming class years ago , i would go to lunch with someone from admissions with a bunch of names on the back of an envelope , said kannerstein , who has been at haverford for 30 years and served as acting dean of admissions last year we would look at a few applicants' folders and pretty soon we 'd have a team it s a different world now that is true for all haverford varsity sports , for men and women , from soccer to softball the volleyball coach , amy bergin , like beccaria , is pragmatic about her approach to recruiting of 1 , 000 i 've contacted , about half will reply , bergin said about half that reply will be academically qualified about half of them will be truly interested in haverford about half of them will be actually good enough to play volleyball for us about half of that group will apply for admission about half of them will get accepted and about half of them will decide to come here if that happens , that s a really good year that s almost eight girls prospecting via email flipping through a binder prepared for coaches at the headfirst camp the 18th recruiting event beccaria visited this summer he examined the grades and test scores of each player he immediately crossed off about 120 players , or 70 percent , saying that their test scores or grades were too low for the next two days , with a roster that matched names to tshirt numbers , beccaria followed the progress of the other 45 players , paying careful attention to the 8 to 10 he had seen at previous showcases some of these players beccaria had known of for more than a year because they had sent email messages to him as juniors in high school it is a common practice that many coaches appreciate you want someone to show the initiative , beccaria said or , as georgetown university s baseball coach , pete wilk , said in an address to parents and campers at the close of the headfirst camp parents , i'm pretty sure your college eligibility is over so let me hear from your son he s the one who might play for me beccaria s email messages from potential applicants often included a schedule of the showcases the player planned to attend this is important information because beccaria and his coaching colleagues rarely scout individual high school games the image of a weary , grizzled coach driving from one dusty high school ballpark to another is a nostalgic artifact at the dozens of highly orchestrated showcases around the country , coaches can see 150 to 200 players in a day and analyze them in an environment that resembles a professional audition the players perform hours of skill drills fielding dozens of ground balls , throwing to every base , catching , hitting , running and playing simulated games another relic of college recruiting s past is the significance of a high school player s senior season beccaria and the other haverford teams' coaches complete their serious evaluations by the summer after a player s junior season this year , most of the haverford coaches had identified their top 20 players by aug 15 with the push to get applications in for early decision on nov 15 , or by the regular decision deadline of jan 15 , an athlete s senior season can be almost irrelevant when beccaria , who led haverford to 25 victories last season and to its first victory in the postseason , watched prospects this summer , he was continually winnowing his list but he knew he did not need to make it too short coaches from other colleges would do that for him even at the smallcollege level , it is hard to hide a prospect , and the most promising are often looking at ivy league universities and other elite colleges that offer grants as enticements at the headfirst camp , there was a moment in a simulated game when one of the players beccaria was interested in , the sidearm pitcher clay bartlett of washington , was facing another beccaria prospect , outfielder ben sestanovich , also of washington it figured to be a good matchup because sestanovich laced a crisp single in an earlier atbat against another pitcher beccaria leaned forward in his chair as the atbat began , aiming a radar gun in his left hand aligned in rows of chairs alongside beccaria , seated like jurors , were 11 other coaches when bartlett struck out sestanovich with a hard , tailing slider on the outside corner to finish two scoreless innings of relief pitching , beccaria was impressed , though he made sure he did nothing to show it without looking , he also knew that the coaches to his left and right , including those from columbia and cornell of the division i ivy league , were busy taking notes on bartlett s unusual delivery and commanding presence beccaria stood and , with a wry smile , walked to another field to watch another player he would keep bartlett and sestanovich on his list there s a long way to go , he said keeping score of the videos while beccaria was visiting showcases , bergin , the volleyball coach , spent her summer nights caring for her 1yearold daughter and calling potential recruits on the phone she rarely goes anywhere without a printed database of prospects filling two fourinchthick ring binders every time she contacts a player some she has called five times she notes the date of the conversation and what was discussed on the player s file that way she will not repeat herself not make the same pitch about the benefits of haverford s proximity to philadelphia twice , for example and bergin listens carefully to the athletes , trying to gather clues there are the girls who say , 'well , i'm a division i talent , ' bergin said and i think , 'forget it' i do n't need the attitude i 've got to spend four years with these girls i cross girls off my list all the time because i think they 'll be high maintenance bergin , whose threeyear record at haverford is 5933 , cautiously considers the 15 to 20 email messages or mailings she receives from recruiting services every week recruiting services are private enterprises that charge a fee to massmarket a high school athlete to various colleges they have become increasingly popular , even in the more obscure sports bergin finds the services useful , but she thinks parents are spending too much money on them you just laugh at some of the professional videos i get with their hollywood special effects , she said it s so unnecessary just give me a few skills highlights , and then i want to see a simple game tape i 've seen enough girls hitting balls as 'eye of the tiger' plays in the background to last a lifetime giving an honest appraisal on an overcast day in early august , haverford s men s lacrosse coach , mike murphy , stood near the lush , treelined center of campus awaiting his first potential recruit of the day seven months from haverford s next lacrosse game , this was potentially a pivotal day for murphy s program he had stacked appointments to escort four quality prospects , and their parents , around campus three days earlier , meeting with another prospect , murphy had courteously encouraged the player to focus on other colleges or universities because his high school grade point average \( 31 on a scale of 1 to 4 \) and his sat score \( 1 , 120 \) would make him a long shot to be admitted to haverford despite the fact that i like him as a player , i have to be honest , murphy said there should be more dialogue like that kids should ask what are my chances of getting in \? what are my chances of playing \? two years ago , murphy discouraged a top high school goalie from coming to haverford because murphy had a young , promising goalie who was only one year older i told him , 'you can come here , but you 'll probably sit for three years , ' murphy said the goalie went to swarthmore , haverford s chief rival 10 miles to the southwest and of course , he starts in goal as a freshman for swarthmore and when we play them , on the first sequence of the game , he stuffs one of our guys on a pointblank shot , murphy said , rolling his eyes i'm thinking , 'what did i do \? ' but our guys played pretty good so did our goalie we won , 117 now , on this day , murphy s top recruiting priority is finding a goalie so that he is prepared when his current starter graduates he has identified 12 high school and prep school goalies after spending eight weeks traveling from texas to massachusetts attending camps akin to the baseball showcase events for murphy , who has resurrected haverford lacrosse with consecutive winning seasons , recruiting is a meticulous business he does not do mass mailings trolling for recruits a threeyear starter at duke and a former assistant coach at brown , virginia and penn , murphy relies on his contacts and his own eye in june , at a camp at the brunswick school in greenwich , conn , murphy surveyed 150 players over six hours of play he wrote down the name of one player the high school goalie murphy is welcoming to the haverford campus is kevin friedenberg of needham , mass murphy has scouted friedenberg twice seconds after shaking murphy s hand at the student center , friedenberg hands over his transcript , which murphy scans in seconds and offers immediate advice he wants friedenberg to take as many advanced placement courses as he can in his senior year you 're a good student , but that s the first thing that admissions will ask about , murphy said murphy takes friedenberg and his parents on a tour of the campus and athletic facilities , answering questions as he walks , but he makes sure to come back to the advanced placement courses and how important it is for friedenberg to take all that are offered when recruiting at this level , if you do n't take your cues from the people at admissions and use it to guide the prospects on their academic record , you 're just crazy , murphy said that s probably as important as identifying athletic talent in parting , murphy persuaded friedenberg to come for a weekend visit in october , when the haverford campus welcomes its prized recruits in every sport murphy s other visits went similarly , although on one of his campus tours , a player from maryland asked murphy where he might rank among the defensemen murphy was recruiting you 're not in the top five , murphy said you might be in the top 15 but academically you 're more qualified than 80 percent some of those defensemen ahead of you are going to be good enough to go play division i some will go elsewhere in division iii so you can move up you can also improve i 'd like to come watch you play again later , asked if it was hard to be so blunt , murphy said i have to have that conversation with him sooner or later there are coaches , even in division iii , who tell every recruit , 'you 're my top guy' they just stockpile i do n't want to mislead anyone at the end of the day , murphy was back at the campus center , awaiting his last visitor you start this process knowing of hundreds of kids you think you might want to play for you , he said but you know that only a few will actually be on the field at your first practice and none of them will be on scholarship and all of them can walk away at any time they can just quit so you better have made your choices carefully , and they better have come for the right reasons the athlete s edge recruiting for athletes has become competitive even among smaller colleges like haverford articles in this series will periodically examine how haverford coaches decide whom to support in the admissions process , how the athletics and admissions offices interact , and how potential recruits view the system bill pennington discusses recruiting at elite small colleges at nytimescom sports
viacom yesterday named brad grey , one of the most prominent talent managers in hollywood , chairman and chief executive of its troubled paramount motion picture group the move promises further change at an operation that has been among hollywood s weakest in recent years mr grey succeeds both sherry lansing , who earlier announced her planned retirement as studio chief , and jonathan dolgen , who left as chairman of viacom s entertainment group last june as the head of brillsteingrey entertainment , mr grey runs a production and management firm with a long roster of clients that includes big names like adam sandler , brad pitt and lorne michaels he will become only the 10th executive to head the paramount movie studio in its 92year history , when he takes over on or before march 1 a series of underperforming films last year , including the stepford wives , and sky captain and the world of tomorrow , left paramount in seventh place in market share at the box office , after having enjoyed major success in the mid1990 s with forrest gump and titanic \( a coproduction with 20th century fox \) despite more encouraging showings by the spongebob squarepants movie , and lemony snicket s a series of unfortunate events , paramount still finished significantly behind all the other big studios the bottom line has been an equal concern viacom s entertainment division , which also includes the simon schuster book division and theme parks , posted operating income of just 2013 million on revenue of 288 billion in the first nine months of 2004 even viacom s struggling radio division , which is about half the size of the entertainment group , had operating income more than three times as great with its commitment to midrange budgets and cofinancing arrangements , ms lansing and mr dolgen laid a very conservative trail for paramount , making it the studio of last resort for talent and bigbudget projects , said dennis mcalpine of mcalpine associates , an independent research firm once the community became aware of that , they just went elsewhere over the last year or so , paramount has begun reversing course , and mr grey will inherit some highprofile films from his predecessors mr sandler is being paid an estimated 25 million for a remake of the 1970 s burt reynolds s comedy the longest yard charlize theron received 8 million to star in aeon flux , based on the mtv animated sciencefiction show the bigbudget war of the worlds , with tom cruise as star and steven spielberg as director , comes out this summer mr grey also endorsed viacom s intention to exploit its mtv networks empire , which includes cable channels like mtv , nickelodeon and comedy central those are great brands , he said and we should make use of them that may mean releasing more movies that appeal to younger audiences , while also bolstering the studio s specialty division , paramount classics mr grey said he had confidence in paramount s coming slate , specifically mentioning war of the worlds , a coproduction with dreamworks mr grey , 47 , a native of the bronx , said he would personally approve films , meaning he would give the clearance to begin production while most of his production experience has been in television , including the sopranos , mr grey had moved recently into films in partnership with mr pitt and jennifer aniston , two stars his company manages , mr grey formed a company , plan b , which is producing the remake of charlie and the chocolate factory starring johnny depp plan b , which is housed at warner brothers , has more than 20 movies in various stages of development among them is the movie version of the bestselling novel the curious incident of the dog in the nighttime by mark haddon mr grey said none of the details of ending his relationship with warner had been worked out he credited the warner president , alan horn , with allowing me to pursue this career change before settling the details of the plan b deal mr horn , who praised mr grey s abilities , said he was willing to wait to work out such a settlement having a strong personal relationship with another studio head is good for warner brothers , mr horn said in a telephone interview , mr grey said that he had worked out a deal with brillsteingrey s top remaining executives to turn it over to them an announcement about the structure at brillsteingrey , which mr grey owns , will be made next week it was more frankly an emotional issue in leaving because these are people i grew up with , mr grey said he pointed out that numerous previous studio heads had made the jump from talent representation ron meyer , a cofounder of creative artists agency , for instance , left it and has been successfully running universal studios but michael s ovitz , also a cofounder of creative artists agency , had a brief turbulent tenure at the walt disney company he was fired after only 14 months given his new role , mr grey will probably sever his connections to continuing projects mr meyer engineered a similar setup when he left his agency job several industry colleagues cited mr grey s ability to make deals and his handling of talent as skills he will be able to put to use two years ago , mr grey managed to mend what looked to be an irreparable rift between hbo and the actor james gandolfini , the star of the sopranos , and he was instrumental in working behind the scenes to keep the stars of friends on the show critics have said that paramount has suffered because it does not have a strong identity as a studio , avoiding epictype films like warner brothers , which has made major franchises of the matrix and harry potter series , among others thomas d mottola , a friend of mr grey who was a talent manager when he was put in charge of the cbs and later sony music operation in 1988 , said experience at multiple tasks and starmaintenance should serve the executive well in his new job if you have a sense of doing that , you have good instincts , mr mottola said then , after that , you need a crystal ball and a lot of luck
for nearly a week i had been gazing at the caspian sea from my hotel room in ramsar , iran , wondering what an angling session might produce in such exotic waters arguably both a lake and a sea , the caspian sits about 100 feet below world ocean level , receiving the discharge of some 75 rivers but having no outlet all that water vaporizes to the sky , leaving its elevation in a delicate climatic balance but this intense evaporation concentrates salts , making the sea brackish the caspian has gone through major geological changes , its primary feeder , the southflowing volga , once drained the other way , to the arctic this allowed marine creatures to invade , so that today this inland basin is home to seals , crabs , shellfish and an array of unlikely finfish but the caspian is most famous for sturgeons , with five species coexisting , including the coveted beluga , source of the world s most esteemed caviar i was one of the few americans among 600 experts from 24 nations at the fifth international sturgeon symposium in may , a gathering designed to exchange information on the science and conservation of sturgeons ramsar was a fitting site not only is the caspian the producer of most of the world s caviar , but iran is by far the most serious of the five border states in controlling the rampant poaching that has decimated its sturgeon stocks early in the week i had asked mohammed pourkazemi , director of the international sturgeon research institute of iran , if he could set up an angling junket he told me to be ready after the final session of the symposium when that evening arrived , two german sturgeon researchers , joern gessner and gerd arndt , ron bruch of wisconsin and i loaded into a jeep and were taken to meet our hosts at a caviarprocessing facility on the outskirts of ramsar although i had brought along my pack rod and a bag of tackle , none of my guests had any gear and to our dismay , neither did the iranians when we mustered at the beach the tallies were not good we were 12 men with three boats , one fishing rod and no bait someone scraped up a cane pole and an old telescoping rod from somewhere in a shed i showed one of the iranian leaders , afshin oliaee , some spinners and spoons i had packed but he shook his head and uttered toomeh , or bait in farsi i remembered that i had half of a pack of manmade , artificially scented toomeh in my kit for emergencies such as this i showed the tiny pellets to our hosts , they inspected them and shrugged , and we cast off , anchoring a half mile off the beach at last , to drop a line in the caspian ! would i catch a sturgeon , maybe a 10footlong beluga the giant catfish , the wels , which can reach 600 pounds the caspian salmon , cousin to the atlantic salmon or perhaps the aspius , a fierce fisheating carp \? well , one can only catch what bites ron manned the telescoping rod , and he quickly reeled up a goby , a small bottom feeder often used in soup he continued to catch gobies , while i struggled to hold bottom in the strong flow , so my attentive hosts handed me a similar rig i caught a few gobies and then passed the rod around so all would have a turn the evening passing quickly as we joked and swapped stories using a modicum of shared english at dusk , we hauled anchor and went farther offshore to view a sturgeon research net there , we enjoyed fruit cookies along with beer but only the governmentmandated nonalcoholic variety toasting our new friendships later , back at the hotel the longsincedeposed shah s converted palace i thought of how , on a personal level , the sheer humanness of our shared experience had overwhelmed any awkwardness we might have felt over the festering issues among our governments

tehran , april 23 with elections less than two months away , iran s presidential hopefuls are scrambling to lure voters , promising everything from lowering the soaring prices of fruit and vegetables to normalizing relations with the country s longtime foe , the united states but much of the public is deeply apathetic there is no real chance for a candidate who can spearhead the democratic changes once promised by the departing president , mohammad khatami , who proved unable to ward off the encroachment of the guardian council and its repressive agenda over the last eight years , the opposition has been marginalized as the judiciary has shut down more than 100 prochange newspapers and journals and jailed dozens of advocates and intellectuals candidates , will be on the june 17th ballot only if approved by the council , which consists of six judges and six clerics those who are deemed politically undesirable will be forced out of the race but the public seems ever less convinced that the council , created after the 1979 iranian revolution to oversee all government decisions , should have such power when it barred more than 2 , 000 candidates from parliamentary elections in 2004 , widespread disillusionment followed recent freer elections in afghanistan and iraq have made election constraints harder to justify last sunday , president khatami spoke to the council , against a backdrop of rising international pressure over iran s nuclear program the bush administration has even suggested that israel might act preemptively , as it did in 1981 when it bombed an iraqi nuclear reactor if people feel the candidates they want to vote for are banned from running , they will get disillusioned , he said the country is faced with very obvious foreign threats only a large turnout can give legitimacy to the regime and deter the threats such a turnout appears unlikely the student movement , a driving force behind the landslide election of president khatami in 1997 , has been so alienated by his failure to accomplish real change that its leaders say students will boycott the election unless they find a candidate who will support amending the constitution it is obvious that reform within the framework of the current constitution is not possible , said mehdi aminzadeh , a member of the office for consolidating unity , the top student movement it is time to call for a referendum on the constitution so far , about a dozen people are running , and they tend to use the word reform , without specifying any the most discussed possible candidate is former president ali akbar hashemi rafsanjani , 70 , a political heavyweight who has hinted that he might enter the race to steer the country away from crisis analysts say he is awaiting a goahead from the supreme religious leader , ayatollah ali khamenei and for preelection polls to forecast his chances he suffered a humiliation in the parliamentary elections of 2001 when he failed to win enough votes last week , he met with members of the office for consolidating unity and said that if he ran , he would do so with a new agenda that would be more compatible with the conditions and the needs of society the students took this as a suggestion that he might opt for more moderate policies than his own in the past his supporters point to his international standing and flexibility with hardliners and advocates of change we need somebody who has the authority to bring balance among the political factions in the country , and one who can ease relations with the outside world and the united states , said saeed leylaz , a journalist and political analyst in tehran mr rafsanjani cannot fix things overnight , but none of the other candidates can do these two tasks except for mr rafsanjani the other candidates have lower profiles mohammad baqer qalibaf , 42 , a former national police chief , portrays himself as a pragmatist and claims to have cut highway accidents tens of thousands die in iran each year because of bad driving ibrahim asgharzadeh , 50 , who was among the iranians who stormed the american embassy in tehran in 1979 , is running on a mandate to improve relations with the united states i am the one who had the courage to lock the gate of the us embassy and put the key in my pocket , he said in an interview only i can return it and fix relations mehdi karoubi , the former speaker of parliament , is running as a moderate and has promised , if elected , to give about 60 a month , to every iranian over the age of 18
when howard stern crosses over in january to satellite radio and his own payperview cable channel , he will do so from a new midtown manhattan studio loaded with the kinds of accessories that one would expect to find if the playboy mansion were given an extreme makeover at the touch of a button , a rack will drop from the studio s twostory ceiling to reveal a selection of bikinis , for those guests who can be cajoled out of their street clothes a corner of the studio which is located not at a gentleman s club but on the 36th floor of the mcgrawhill building at rockefeller center has been outfitted with waterresistant walls and floors , for any gags that might involve whipped cream and just outside mr stern s reach as well as that of the federal communications commission , which monitored him on commercial radio but no longer will will be a stripper pole while mr stern will also be taking plenty of gadgets with him from his syndicated terrestrial radio talk show including the tickle chair , which is not to be confused with the tickle post he will be leaving one noticeable piece of baggage behind the increasingly tough restrictions imposed on him in recent years by his bosses \( at infinity broadcasting \) and the fcc indeed , executives at sirius satellite radio which is paying mr stern 100 million a year over five years to produce his own morning show and to program two radio channels and in demand networks , which will package excerpts for payperview , said they had placed no limits on what he could do like a teenage boy suddenly set loose in a school patrolled by neither a principal nor teachers , mr stern said in an interview on tuesday that he had yet to rule anything out including that the use of his microphones and cameras to record a sex act in his brandnew 4 , 100squarefoot studio i do n't know where we 're going to go with this thing , he said it s going to be kind of fun to figure that out with the audience i 'll ask them , 'do we want to go there or not \? are we going to cross this line or that line \? ' still , the possibility that mr stern , 51 , might go from rrated fare his current show features interviews with topless guests to softcore pornography could just be a tease he has long been a master barker who can lure listeners under his tent for the sheer thrill of wondering how far he might go to that end , mr stern simultaneously dampened such expectations , saying that while none of his new bosses had drawn any boundaries for his new show , he expected to do so i have my own personal lines where i wo n't go , he said it s funny , the people hear satellite , ' they hear 'on demand , ' they think , 'oh good , there s going to be a beheading every week' that s not it at all this was n't about getting on the air and having the freedom to have sex with a woman , necessarily , he said of his move to satellite instead , he suggested , to talk about human sexuality in a way that s adult , or maybe even really super childish , is my prerogative as a comedian scott greenstein , president of entertainment and sports for sirius , said , howard has a history of knowing where the lines are , and we 're confident he 'll continue to retain that perspective at sirius mr greenstein added , however , we want to make sure he gets to do the show he wants which actually could pose a creative challenge for mr stern to many listeners , he was best when railing against michael powell the former chairman of the fcc , which over the years has levied decency fines of more than 2 million on infinity and the stations that carry his program and his own squeamish bosses just this week , mr stern was reprimanded on the air by tom chiusano , general manager of wxrkfm , his home station , for going too far with a bit that involved the weighing of bodily waste mr stern , who signs off wxrk in middecember , promised an uncensored version on sirius , which is not subject to fcc regulation asked if he was worried that he might lose his edge without having a foil in a position of authority , mr stern said he was not if you know me , there s nothing that will make me completely happy , he said i will find the thorn on the rose every time come on , he continued i'm having this whole love affair with sirius then the other day i started screaming on the air about some of the guys who work there , just because i was blowing off steam for mr stern s fans a national radio audience estimated at about 12 million the transition toward opening their wallets to listen and watch him \( as well as his sidekick , robin quivers \) will be a gradual one beginning nov 18 , viewers in 20 million homes in nearly 300 markets \( including new york and los angeles \) will be able to buy access to a channel called howard stern on demand the introductory price will be 999 a month what they will see initially will not be from the sirius show , but instead will be drawn from the 44 , 000 hours taped during the 11 years that mr stern s program was repackaged for the e ! cable channel mr stern said he retained the rights to that material , much of it originally shown with strategically placed pixilation , if it was ever shown on television at all that material will now be shown uncensored by in demand , a venture of comcast , cox communications and time warner rob jacobson , president and chief executive of in demand , said the company would give sirius three months to broadcast mr stern s new shows exclusively but beginning april 1 , subscribers to the payperview package will have access to those shows , as well as each new show , which will be available the day after sirius listeners have heard it beginning in january \( the exact date has not been announced \) , mr stern s two sirius channels will be available to those willing to pay for a receiver \( models start at 50 \) and a monthly fee of 1295 the same flat fee provides access to dozens of other channels , including those featuring martha stewart and eminem sirius executives have been circumspect about the content of the two stern channels but the host , showing he had not lost his knack for tweaking his bosses , provided the most detailed description yet of his plans he said that one channel would showcase various freeform spinoffs of his morning show , featuring not only his regular cast \( including gary dell'abate , his longtime producer \) but also prominent listeners with nicknames like highpitched eric the other channel , he said , would be modeled on the good guys the lineup of disc jockeys from wmca , the legendary new york pop station of the late 1960 s and 70 s though rather than being good , mr stern said , the hosts he would hire \( some established , some new \) would push the bounds of decency in a manner not unlike his there will , for example , be plenty of cursing from the absurd basement humor , whatever you call it , lockerroom humor , to just riffing about human experiences , he said i ca n't think of a better utopia for me i thanked god today i made this deal a year ago , he said i really did i would have quit radio for good if it had n't been for this deal

philadelphia , sept 26 as dim as the mets' postseason chances have looked over the last two weeks , manager willie randolph has still acted as if they had a shot a small one , he conceded , but a shot he has not rested his regulars , and before monday s game against the phillies , he allowed for the possibility that pedro mart nez would still pitch again this season if the mets had not been mathematically eliminated yet there is still hope after a stirring fourrun comeback in the eighth inning monday gave the mets a 65 victory at citizens bank park they continued their lateseason stampede through the national league east and dealt a blow to the phillies' playoff chances the phillies fell one and a half games behind houston , who did not play monday , in the wildcard standings the mets would be eliminated from playoff contention with one more loss or one more victory by houston , but they have avoided another september collapse by winning 8 of their past 10 games against division rivals they took two of three against atlanta they messed up florida s playoff plans by winning twice in their final atbat and they swept the nationals over the weekend , eliminating them from contention it s satisfying to play well against these teams , like we 're supposed to , not for us to play spoiler , reliever aaron heilman said before the game we have n't packed it in yet , and we 're going to finish up the season strong after a 2hour35minute rain delay , they stumbled through the first seven innings , managing only four hits against the phillies' starter brett myers when ugueth urbina relieved myers in the eighth , the change seemed to energize them marlon anderson , a former phillie , led off with a double jos reyes walked , and miguel cairo followed with a runscoring double then carlos beltran grounded to chase utley , who booted the ball and then made an errant throw that allowed cairo to score the tying run ryan madson , the phillies' third pitcher of the inning , struck out david wright , but mike jacobs hit a sacrifice fly to the center field fence , putting the mets ahead , 65 the phillies , who have not reached the playoffs since 1993 , end their season with three games at washington , and houston plays two games at st louis before returning home for four against the cubs it was only three weeks ago when it seemed the phillies were on their way toward another underachieving season , another above500 record with nothing to show for it they were swept here by houston , falling two and a half games behind in the wildcard chase , but then surged back into contention with a series of lateinning victories the phillies scored 10 runs in the ninth inning sept 17 to overcome dontrelle willis s shutout bid they scored four in the ninth last thursday to break a scoreless tie and defeat atlanta and last friday , they scored five in the ninth to overcome a 106 deficit at cincinnati and pick up a game on houston they have rallied around the firstyear manager charlie manuel , who has wrung out the tension that ruled the clubhouse under his fiery predecessor , larry bowa manuel has an eventempered , relaxed approach that seems to have gotten the most out of veterans and young players ryan howard , a 6foot4 , 260pound behemoth of a first baseman , has offset the loss of jim thome to seasonending elbow surgery by slamming 20 homers , including nine this month , improving his candidacy for the national league rookie of the year utley , in his first full season in the major leagues , is on his way toward supplanting the dodgers' jeff kent as the national league s besthitting second baseman and is an allstar in the making and pat burrell has recovered from consecutive subpar seasons to lead the team in home runs \( 31 \) and runs batted in \( 114 \) but the player who truly ignites the phillies' offense is the leadoff hitter , jimmy rollins , who leads the majors with 45 hits in september and is batting 481 in his past 18 games yet in philadelphia , none of this will matter much unless the phillies make the playoffs and they could derail all the momentum they spent the last three weeks building by stumbling here against the mets , who vowed they had not given up monday night , they proved it we 're aware the end of the season is coming , but the next seven games are for us , heilman said we care about them inside pitch mets manager willie randolph announced before monday s game that victor zambrano will start in place of pedro mart nez on tuesday mart nez was unavailable for comment the phillies are fortunate not to have to face mart nez \( 158 \) when randolph was asked if he thought the wild cardleading astros should be upset that mart nez was not pitching , he said he did not care we do n't tell them how to do their business , and they should n't be concerned with how we do ours , randolph said if you were in their position , you would probably love to see pedro mart nez pitch , but they do n't know our situation
brad paisley is country music s most likable overachiever he s an affable guy who can sing , write , play guitar and , through it all , crack jokes on wednesday night he came to the nokia theater for a show that made most other bigname country shows seem downright lazy one segment how fast can we play \? wisely disguised an impressive display of virtuosity as a silly lark paradoxically , this lighthearted reputation may help mr paisley when the time comes to sing a gloomy song he had a big hit with whiskey lullaby , and during the show his duet partner , alison krauss , appeared on a video screen to sing the second verse she eulogized a lover who put that bottle to her head and pulled the trigger a different country singer might have had a harder time getting country radio stations to play such a morbid ballad but with mr paisley singing , it s easy to remember that this tragic tale is just a story onstage he followed it swiftly with easy money , which strikes a delicate balance between humility and its opposite mr paisley s admission \( or boast \? \) that he ca n't believe how much cash he makes easy money comes from mr paisley s great new album , time well wasted \( arista nashville \) , where he shows how important a light touch can be there are plenty of jokes \( including the albumclosing goof , cornography \) , but mr paisley is even better at his gentlest , as during the falsetto ballad rainin' you despite the title , it is n't goofy in the least the best known song from the new album is alcohol , a sequel of sorts to whiskey lullaby but the tragedy has been transformed into comedy mr paisley sings in the first person , in the voice of his subject since the day i left milwaukee , lynchburg and bordeaux , france been making the bars lots of big money , he sang , and the crowd gleefully finished the line and helping white people dance ! the opening acts were the popcountry group sugarland and sara evans , a likable singer whose voice is both sprightly and strong her new album is real fine place \( rca nashville \) , a strong cd that shows off two equally important things she can belt , but she does n't always the title track , a real fine place to start , is a sublime countryrock song , with big , ringing electric guitars and fans sang along during suds in the bucket , her big hit from her previous album , which starts spry and builds to a single long , high note no you ca n't fence time and you ca n't stop looove ! but ms evans s set lost momentum whenever she was n't singing , which was often between songs she delivered remarks meant to be endearing , pausing after nearly every phrase for applause or laughter , even when none was forthcoming at one point , she started talking about her children and her fans and how blessed she was and how she thanked god every day and one could imagine a voice , infinitely loving but maybe slightly shorttempered , booming down from the heavens , saying , just play the song this tour continues tonight in lowell , mass , and tomorrow in state college , pa
hempstead , ny , april 24 imagine , if you will , the jets playing on the road next season for a trip to the american football conference championship game the only hurdle in their path is a 43yard fieldgoal attempt as time expires the jets' first pick in the nfl draft , mike nugent , has closed his eyes countless times and envisioned this exact situation luckily for jets fans , nugent foresees the kick splitting the uprights you have to imagine yourself in the toughest situation possible so you can come through when it does arrive , nugent said shortly after being drafted saturday doug brien , the jets' kicker , missed two late fieldgoal attempts in the playoffs against pittsburgh in january , including a 43yarder that sailed left at the end of regulation the jets lost in overtime the jets believe their kicking woes are now distant memories nugent made 24 of 27 field goals at ohio state last season and was a firstteam allamerican the jets also feel that they significantly improved their secondary and special teams during the twoday draft , in which they selected eight players , including five on sunday still , there are holes that went unaddressed and will need to be filled through free agency one question regarding the jets' warroom strategy during the draft will linger for months or maybe years did the team draft a kicker too early \? only four kickers have been selected higher than nugent since 1978 , and only one of them , oakland kicker sebastian janikowski , has prospered at the professional level but kickers are responsible for a healthy portion of their team s points and their kickoff abilities \( or lack thereof \) have a significant impact on field position the jets' decision to use their highest selection on nugent , after trading their firstround pick to oakland for tight end doug jolley last week , seems to reveal their frustration at past kicking failures we feel good about what we did , general manager terry bradway said sunday when asked to evaluate his team s performance at the draft we stayed to a plan we were able to fill most of the needs that we had going into the weekend at tight end , corner , returner we wanted to draft a safety position we were also able to address the running back spot he then dismissed the suggestion that kickers should not be selected in the first few rounds of the draft after nugent , the jets selected four defensive players , including cornerback justin miller \( in the second round \) and safeties kerry rhodes \( fourth round \) and andre maddox \( fifth round \) miller also returns kicks and punts , and rhodes and maddox will most likely be used on special teams none of these players were regarded as toptier prospects , but the jets have a knack for unearthing defensive gems in the draft safety erik coleman , now a starter , was taken in the fifth round last year most observers figured the jets would draft a cornerback with their first pick , not their second donnie abraham may retire , ray mickens missed last season with a knee injury , and the jets failed to sign the free agent andre dyson , whom they coveted , last week the safety position is also a priority jon mcgraw has missed 33 of 48 games , and reggie tongue was inconsistent last season the addition of defensive tackle sione pouha , selected in the third round , will help fill the void left by jason ferguson , who signed with dallas as a free agent the jets acquired the former giant lance legree through free agency , but legree s feet might not be big enough to fill ferguson s shoes at nose tackle josh evans was recently resigned , but he missed 15 games last season because of back surgery since the jets did not pick a surefire runstopper in the draft , hammering out a deal with john abraham might become even more of a priority abraham , designated as their franchise player in february , has rejected the team s 1year , 67 million offer we have conversations all the time , but those conversations are private , bradway said , referring to contract negations with abraham jets coach herman edwards was unavailable for comment the jets did not draft an offensive tackle despite the departure of kareem mckenzie , who left for the giants as a free agent so adrian jones , a fourthround pick last season , will be penciled in to start at right tackle even though he did not start last season we would 've liked to have added a couple young guys , and we 're in the process now of trying to get some free agents signed , bradway said , referring to the offensive line but , valuewise , it just did n't work out at the appropriate times we were getting ready to pick we had some better players available to us bradway added that he had no regrets trading for jolley , and he refused to speculate which player he would have selected had the jets held on to their firstround pick he said there was little value late in the first round so , did the jets close the gap on their division rival , the twotime defending super bowl champion new england patriots \?

in the past week , i 've received several email notes from democrats about the iraq elections , or heard comments from various democratic lawmakers always along the following lines remember , vietnam also had an election , and you recall how that ended or , ok , the election was nice , but none of it was worth 100 billion or 10 , 000 killed and wounded or , you know , we 've actually created more terrorists in iraq election or not i think there is much to criticize about how the war in iraq has been conducted , and the outcome is still uncertain but those who suggest that the iraqi election is just beanbag , and that all we are doing is making the war on terrorism worse as a result of iraq , are speaking nonsense here s the truth there is no single action we could undertake anywhere in the world to reduce the terrorism threat that would have a bigger impact today than a decent outcome in iraq it is that important and precisely because it s so important , it should not be left to this administration democrats need to start thinking seriously about iraq the way joe biden , joe lieberman and hillary clinton have if france the mother of all blue states can do it , so , too , can the democrats otherwise , they will be absenting themselves from the most important foreign policy issue of our day here are four things democrats should be excited about what iraq is now embarking on is the first attempt ever by the citizens of a multiethnic , multireligious arab state to draw up their own social contract , their own constitution , for how they should share power and resources , protect minority rights and balance mosque and state i have no idea whether they will succeed much will depend on whether the shiites want to be a wise and inclusive majority and whether the sunnis want to be a smart and collaborative minority there will be a lot of trial and error in the months ahead but this is a hugely important horizontal dialogue because if iraqis ca n't forge a social contract , it would suggest that no other arab country can since virtually all of them are similar mixtures of tribes , ethnicities and religions that would mean that they can be ruled only by ironfisted kings or dictators , with all the negatives that flow from that but but if iraqis succeed in forging a social contract in the hardest place of all , it means that democracy is actually possible anywhere in the arab world democrats do not favor using military force against iran s nuclear program or to compel regime change there that is probably wise but they do n't really have a diplomatic option i 've got one iraq iraq is our iran policy if we can help produce a representative government in iraq based on free and fair elections and with a shiite leadership that accepts minority rights and limits on clerical involvement in politics it will exert great pressure on the ayatollahdictators running iran in iran s sham islamic democracy , only the mullahs decide who can run over time , iranian shiites will demand to know why they ca n't have the same freedoms as their iraqi cousins right next door that will drive change in iran just be patient the war on terrorism is a war of ideas the greatest restraint on human behavior is not a police officer or a fence it s a community and a culture palestinian suicide bombing has stopped not because of the israeli fence or because palestinians are no longer desperate it has stopped because the palestinians had an election , and a majority voted to get behind a diplomatic approach they told the violent minority that suicide bombing for now is shameful what arabs and muslims say about their terrorists is the only thing that will protect us in the long run it takes a village , and the iraqi election was the iraqi village telling the violent minority that what it is doing is shameful the fascist minority in iraq is virulent , and some jihadists will stop at nothing but the way you begin to drain the swamps of terrorism is when you create a democratic context for those with good ideas to denounce those with bad ones egypt and syrianoccupied lebanon both have elections this year watch how the progressives and those demanding representative government are empowered in their struggle against the oneman rulers in egypt and syria if the iraqi experiment succeeds we have paid a huge price in iraq i want to get out as soon as we can but trying to finish the job there , as long as we have real partners , is really important and any party that says otherwise will become unimportant

by many measures , the third annual howl ! festival , in the east village in august , was a success some 250 events involving about 1 , 200 artists were held over eight days , and organizers said that more than 100 , 000 people attended the festival , which was started to celebrate the neighborhood s art and culture for three summers , the festival has sponsored new events and recreated old ones , like art around the park , which first took place in the early 1990 s , when artists painted on a canvas stretched around tompkins square park after the city closed it for renovation but some supporters of howl ! are raising questions about the festival and its role in the neighborhood some critics say the federation of east village artists , formed in 2003 to organize the festival , has failed to act as an advocate for local artists and as a guardian of creative countercultural life others question how the federation manages its money nearly everyone involved with the festival and the group that runs it including the two founders agreed that it began with lofty goals but they also say that achieving those ends has not been easy the federation s mission was lost , said david leslie , an east village artist and a founder of the festival the further we get away from our vision , the more flagrant the mistakes will become mr leslie said that the federation had not been democratic and transparent enough instead , he said , phil hartman who first came up with the idea for the howl ! festival and who has been the federation s executive director has made nearly all of the most important decisions alone or with a board whose members were chosen by him and by two federation employees mr hartman hired and appointed to the board although mr leslie and others said they admired mr hartman for his vision and determination , they also said that he employed a rigid management style some of his choices , like entering into arrangements with corporate sponsors , have jarred federation members who said they feared that the east village s long artistic legacy and spirit of independence might be compromised at the same time , mr leslie and others said , the federation has not taken serious steps toward goals that energized them at first , like providing health care for artists none of us have ever been in it for the money , said penny arcade , a performance artist who is on the federation s advisory board we 've been in it for the glory and the pride and the authenticity mr hartman who said that he had sold parts of his restaurant businesses to finance howl ! , and who said that he decided several months ago to step down as volunteer executive director to make way for a fulltime paid replacement said he sympathized with some complaints i think it s very normal at about this point in an organization s life cycle to reflect back on the mission and the structure and reevaluate , he said , adding that he would remain involved as a board member it s been enormous from the beginning and very difficult to nurture mr hartman said that he welcomed additional opinions and that the federation was exploring ways to provide health care for artists these are huge projects , he said differences have not been limited to the federation s mission michael rosen , a former member of the federation board , said that after he gathered more than 80 , 000 in donations from neighborhood residents and a loan to the federation , mr hartman declined his request to see financial records showing how some of the money had been spent mr rosen also said he was disappointed that the federation had yet to become registered as a nonprofit group mr hartman said he had not been able to immediately show financial records to mr rosen he added that the federation had not acquired nonprofit status because of filing errors , but said the filing would soon be done properly the board will soon expand to 15 members from 9 , mr hartman said , and a committee with people from the board of directors and the advisory board will be formed to oversee the federation s mission despite the disagreements , the future of the federation and the festival is important to many artists in the neighborhood artists gave cultural capital to something that became commercial , said clayton patterson , a photographer , filmmaker and gallery owner who has been on the federation s advisory board we 've lost our soul , and part of fixing howl ! is getting our soul back
the cost of insurance for homes and businesses is expected to rise sharply in the gulf coast states because of hurricane katrina , and even more so with hurricane rita , industry experts said yesterday policyholders far from the battered coastline are also expected to face higher premiums prices for home insurance in new orleans , elsewhere in louisiana and in mississippi could easily jump an average of 15 percent to 30 percent , industry executives and analysts said in other states vulnerable to hurricanes , they said , the increase might be as little as 3 percent to 5 percent , with smaller rises in areas far from the atlantic and gulf of mexico coasts insurance for offices , factories and other businesses , which is less heavily regulated , is expected to rise even more than home insurance it s going to be quite pronounced in the affected areas , said robert p hartwig , the chief economist for the insurance information institute , a trade group in new york insurance companies themselves will have to pay significantly more for the coverage they buy from each other to spread their risk , coverage known as reinsurance , insurance executives said that expense is expected to jump 10 percent to 20 percent , reversing a recent decline of more than 10 percent a year the increase will be passed on to homeowners and businesses , a major reason premiums are expected to rise not only in areas of the united states far from the gulf coast but around the world as well think of this as throwing a rock into a lake and the next thing you have little waves going out in all directions , said kevin lampo , an analyst at edward jones in st louis prices usually jump after a big hurricane as losses reduce the insurers' pool of capital and customers seek to maintain or increase coverage a classic example of supplyanddemand economics the insurers say they do not literally raise their prices to recover losses but , in a process that has the same effect , they factor in the new losses as a potential cost in the future and raise prices to give them enough money to pay those claims if they occur we project out into the future what our loss costs are going to be and we do that with a new set of glasses , said michael trevino , a spokesman for allstate , the nation s secondlargest home and auto insurer behind state farm even before hurricane rita , industry executives said the estimated losses from katrina and two other weaker hurricanes had already made this year the most costly ever for natural disasters many insurance executives expect the industry s cost from hurricane katrina alone to be about 35 billion one storm damage tracking firm , risk management solutions , even calculates a cost of 40 billion to 60 billion as hurricane rita moved toward texas late yesterday , mr hartwig estimated that damage might be 4 billion to 8 billion , down from perhaps 30 billion had the storm churned directly over galveston and houston with their heavy concentration of petrochemical plants and other businesses one computergenerated estimate by eqecat , a storm tracking company , put potential losses at as much as 18 billion , assuming the storm went ashore near port arthur , tex , and the louisiana border as a strong category 3 or weak category 4 hurricane the previous industry record for natural disasters was a little more than 27 billion last year , when four powerful hurricanes hit florida the insurers paid about 35 billion in today s dollars for losses in the world trade center attacks this is going to be the worst hurricane year in terms of costs , and we have n't even seen what rita is going to do , said karen m clark , the chief executive of air worldwide , a boston company that calculates hurricane damage the insurers are hoping that the heavy losses will generate support in washington for a program they have long sought that would provide them federal assistance in dealing with big natural disasters they also hope the storms will increase support in congress for renewal of the government program that promises to pay the majority of insurance losses in a terrorist attack , up to 100 billion that terrorism program is scheduled to expire at the end of the year the storm damage has driven down stock prices for many insurance companies , and industry executives say some smaller companies may be forced into bankruptcy nearly a dozen small insurers collapsed after hurricane andrew , which hit in 1992 and cost the industry about 23 billion in today s dollars andrew was the most expensive single hurricane until katrina the insurers may face an additional estimated 15 billion in costs if they are forced to pay for extensive flood damage from the storm surge caused by hurricane katrina in mississippi , louisiana and alabama their policies specifically rule out responsibility for any kind of flood damage , the insurers say even so , both jim hood , the attorney general of mississippi , and richard scruggs , a plaintiffs' lawyer who was prominent in the 246 billion settlement with the tobacco industry a few years ago , say they are determined to make the insurers pay the mississippi attorney general is seeking a temporary restraining order preventing the insurers from enforcing the flood exclusion in their policies , and mr scruggs said he was preparing to file individual lawsuits on behalf of at least several hundred homeowners this is a big issue for pricing , ms clark said if they are required to pay for flooding , when they reprice their policies , they 're going to have to account for that peril , which they had not accounted for previously the insurers' rationale for price increases for hurricane coverage is being reinforced by meteorologists' predictions that the united states is in for possibly a long period of unusually heavy storm assaults when it turns out that the insurers have overestimated future costs , they are required to reduce their prices to reflect the more favorable experience with claims that has been happening for home insurance customers over the last few years , especially in texas , where many large claims for mold damage pushed prices up the insurers' costs fell sharply after they succeeded in getting texas and other states to permit them to end coverage for mold after the four hurricanes swept florida last year , insurers began pushing up prices for home insurance there by as much as 30 percent , with some homeowners hit with increases of more than 50 percent for some in the most vulnerable areas , the price increases along the gulf coast could run even higher than in florida , experts said even though insurance prices in florida are among the highest in the country , they are being restrained by tough building codes , which reduce damage and risk for insurance companies , and a state fund that pays much of the losses in the worst hurricanes none of the gulf states have these buffers
'reversing the curse' 'inside the 2004 boston red sox' by dan shaughnessy 260 pages houghton mifflin 23 'emperors and idiots' 'the hundredyear rivalry between the yankees and red sox , from the very beginning to the end of the curse' by mike vaccaro 364 pages doubleday 2495 for red sox fans , the approach of opening day of the 2005 baseball season means a chance to replay the miraculous events of last year not just the team s first world series victory since 1918 , but with the sweep of the final four games of the american league championship series , the greatest comeback in baseball history and over their most hated rivals , the evil empire itself the new york yankees for members of red sox nation , 2004 was the year that put an end to decades of misery and humiliation , an end to the curse of the bambino , an end to 86 years of boneheaded plays , bitter losses and buckets of bad luck not to mention baleful memories of babe ruth , bucky dent , bill buckner and aaron boone for those of us who are yankees fans , the approach of this spring s opening day means something very different it means trying to come to terms with the greatest choke job in baseball history , a monumental , mindboggling collapse being up three games to none against the longjinxed red sox and a mere three outs away from the world series it means a crack in the cocky confidence of the ball club known as the team of the century and a recognition that the dynastic hopes of the late 1990 s are truly no more it means , in short , a flashback to the bad acid trip that was 2004 , along with lots of loathing and dare we say it at least a frisson of fear depending on readers' team allegiances , one of these two reactions will inform their take on two new books about the yankeesred sox rivalry agnostic readers , while finding these volumes informative , will probably resent all the further attention being lavished on these two northeast corridor ball clubs , which have already dominated the last two years of baseball coverage in contrast to the youarethere immediacy of stewart o'nan and stephen king s 2004 book , faithful \( a quickly produced and thoroughly partisan account of the victorious red sox season \) , these two volumes provide deliberative accounts of the bostonnew york feud dan shaughnessy , a sports columnist for the boston globe , does so in reversing the curse by chronicling the entire 2004 red sox season , bookended by the sox s devastating loss in october 2003 to the yankees in a game 7 they should have won and their incredible victory a year later mike vaccaro , a sports columnist for the new york post , takes a widerangled look at the two teams in emperors and idiots , intercutting his narrative of the 2003 and 2004 seasons with lengthy historical flashbacks , recounting a litany of famous clashes that fans of both teams by now probably know by heart the rivalries between joe dimaggio and ted williams , thurman munson and carlton fisk boston s loss of the 1949 pennant to the yankees after blowing the season s final two games the sox' s loss of a onegame playoff in 1978 to the yankees \( thanks to bucky dent \) and of course boston s fall to new york in 2003 \( thanks to aaron boone \) while mr vaccaro writes like a good utility infielder in straightahead , serviceable prose , mr shaughnessy writes more like a flashy sinker ball pitcher , putting lots of body language on his words mr vaccaro does a far superior job of situating last year s events in a historical context , while mr shaughnessy proves far more adept at capturing the mood , the emotion , the palpable feel of the bostonnew york showdown both books have their lapses mr shaughnessy s blowbyblow account sometimes goes into detail about earlyintheseason games that only the most rabid sox fan would care about mr vaccaro sometimes allows his writing to devolve into boilerplate sportswriting clich s you really could set your watch by the yankees and the red sox , he writes no matter what , when you threw the two of them in the same building , something was going to happen because something always did what both writers manage to do is capture the intensity of this rivalry the hostility no , make that hate many fans and team members feel toward one another , an enmity that extends in recent years all the way up to the executive suites of george steinbrenner and larry lucchino it s a rivalry that escalated with hotly contested bids for alex rodriguez , jos contreras and curt schilling \( while the yankees landed the first two players , the red sox clearly scored the more productive deal \) and a rivalry that resulted in depictions of last year s two teams as polar opposites the cleancut , corporate yankees versus the scruffy , longhaired sox the richest , most storied franchise versus the perennial underdog the evil empire , in mr lucchino s words , versus what mr shaughnessy calls the laughing gashouse gang , a band of rogues who let their hair down , drove motorcycles , drank shots of jack daniel s before games , wore their shirts untucked , and smeared pine tar all over their helmets of course , as both these books point out , it was also a lot more complicated than that while the yankees did indeed have a payroll north of 180 million , the red sox were in second place with roughly 130 million and while the boston players might have projected the image of slacker misfits , the blueprint behind the team \( engineered by the wunderkind general manager theo epstein \) was , in mr vaccaro s words , to craft success scientifically using lots of numbers and statistics this is how kevin millar , bill mueller , david ortiz and todd walker ended up in boston , along with schilling , the veteran ace , and the closer keith foulke , who had been signed to fill holes in the 2003 pitching staff it was a similarly pragmatic business approach , mr shaughnessy notes , that led mr epstein to trade the team s disaffected star shortstop , nomar garciaparra , last summer a move that many fans believe led to a turnaround in the team s chemistry and fortunes if the red sox were learning , as the yankees veteran bernie williams observed , to play the way we used to play playing the small game , around the cornerstones like manny ramirez and johnny damon the yankees were abdicating the formula that had recently won them four championships in five years management had allowed the homegrown pitching ace andy pettitte to leave it had stripmined its farm system , depriving the team of fresh talent and tradable players and it had chased after allstars like arod , kevin brown , kenny lofton , gary sheffield and jason giambi , who had never really come together as a cohesive team a result , at least in october 2004 , was a stunning reversal of fortune straight out of bizarro world the perennial champions , who used to make all the clutch plays , all the impossible comebacks , blew a threegame lead , while the perennial losers staged a seemingly impossible comeback during an epic and exhausting series that included the longest playoff game in history as these two books make clear , that series had a surreal quality almost as if it belonged in one of those mystical baseball fables like field of dreams or the natural from the red sox getting the sort of lucky breaks the yankees used to get \( like a ground rule double in game 5 that prevented a crucial yankee run from scoring \) to schilling s remarkable comeback from what had seemed to be a seasonending injury to pitch game 6 call it karma , mojo , luck , whatever the achievement of these two books is that they capture the mysterious role played by the inscrutable baseball gods in the outcome of the game and the many fateful intangibles that defined the yankeesred sox playoff series of 2004 the year , as one of the new york tabloids observed , that hell froze over , or as dan shaughnessy puts it , the year that pigs flew and cows jumped over a giant red moon in the late october sky boston fans would say , history starts now yankees fans would say one in 86 years \? we 've got 26
it occurred to me the other day , as someone born , reared and schooled in the bronx , that new yorkers have given the poethumorist ogden nash a pass for far too long everybody thinks he was so clever but this man should be condemned , even if long dead , for having written a most vicious couplet you know the one the bronx \? no thonx ! the insult is intolerable yet many new yorkers smile at it is n't it time to say , enough is enough \? what inspired this thought was the boldness shown by bronx political leaders this week they are not about to remain silent when their borough is slighted , no matter how insignificantly or unintentionally they stood tall after mayor michael r bloomberg went to the bronx zoo and made the smallest of jokes a reporter asked him for his favorite animal why anyone should care is a separate question why the mayor paused to even think about it is another but pause he did they do n't vote , the reporter said mr bloomberg replied this is the bronx i do n't know as jokes go , it was n't much but it was more than enough for the politicians \( none of them from the mayor s party \) a stupid thing to say , the borough president fumed one assemblyman said he was offended another demanded an apology that was when latent resentment against nash took shape here resolve like that shown by the politicians should be emulated something must be done about nash perhaps collections of his work could be removed in protest from bronx library shelves , at least on aug 19 , the anniversary of his birth in 1902 if only he was n't so darn quotable he even wrote something that might apply to a mayor with a knack for utterances that sometimes make audiences wince do we really want leaders who sanitize their every word \? in reflection on a wicked world , nash wrote purity is obscurity still , some officials feel they have to prove their capacity for outrage the queens district attorney demonstrated that on a far more serious matter this week when he charged two teenagers with hate crimes they were accused of beating up another young man who dyed his hair blue and painted his fingernails black he called himself a satanist to some , this might seem like a case of kids assaulting someone they resent or deem an oddball inexcusable , if the charges are true , but something lunkheaded kids have done pretty much since cain took out abel but because of the victim s unusual preference in worship , the district attorney chose to show outrage and make this a hate crime that raised the stakes considerably instead of a possible 7 years in prison , the teenagers could each get 15 years if found guilty james b jacobs , a law professor at new york university , feels that a case of this kind demonstrates the weakness of the entire concept of hatecrimes legislation a prominent critic of such laws , professor jacobs considers them feelgood measures that violate the notion of equal protection under the law by creating separate classes of victims they also punish people more severely for holding thoughts labeled impure , professor jacobs says the actions themselves are already crimes deciding which ones are hate crimes and which are n't seems very arbitrary to me , he said i'm of the old school that holds that all assaults are bad they all reflect some kind of bias , some kind of antisocial values they are also in decline in new york city the police recorded 513 bias incidents in 1996 by 2000 , when the state enacted its hatecrimes law , the number had dropped to 467 in 2004 , it fell to 267 like virtually every other crime , bias incidents are down because we are paying attention to them , police commissioner raymond w kelly said criminal behavior is n't what it used to be as it turns out , holding a grudge against nash seems to be misguided richard magat , a member of the bronx county historical society , brought to my attention a time when nash did penance i ca n't seem to escape the sins of my smartaleck youth , he said in 1964 , seven years before his death here are my amends i wrote those lines , 'the bronx \? no thonx ! ' i shudder to confess them now i'm an older , wiser man i cry , 'the bronx , god bless them ! ' what s there to say after that except thonx \?
baradpur , india in torn clothes , the boys , mostly lowcaste children of laborers , held out their plates to be served from a steaming vat of gruel the image was dickensian , but it represented not 19thcentury england s abdication of responsibility toward the poor but 21stcentury india s seeming embrace of it the children are beneficiaries of an acclaimed program mandated in 2001 by india s supreme court to provide cooked lunches to all primary schoolchildren the program is the signature success of a movement in india that is working to create for the poor an entitlementsbased social welfare system much like europe s but this is india , home to the world s largest concentration of poor , where some 350 million people still live on less than a dollar a day so the effort has inevitably raised questions as enormous as the challenge not least , can poor nations have a social safety net , too \? such questions have divided economists , policymakers and advocates here in recent months , reflecting the uncertain science of poverty reduction , the political and financial pressures tugging at this democracy of more than a billion people , and an india conflicted about the face it wants to present to the world welfare and workfare programs are today taken for granted to assist the needy in otherwise prosperous western industrialized societies but they took centuries of effort and upheaval to take shape how much more staggering the task , then , for india the country ranks 127th out of 177 countries on the united nations human development index , which measures life span , education and living standard nearly half its children are undernourished , a level worse than subsaharan africa as the social welfare movement expands its goals , debate is expanding , too , over the obligations of the state toward the poor , what india s government can do , and whether betterment can or should be left to economic growth alone for example , the movement s latest effort to get a law guaranteeing the rural poor jobs on public works projects has proved deeply controversial as originally envisioned , the employment law would have guaranteed one member of any rural household 100 days' minimumwage employment a year on a public works project near home resisting the costs , the congressled coalition government has since substantially pared back the bill advocates for the poor say the later version would leave vulnerable most of the more than 90 percent of india s labor force that has no unemployment insurance or pension enrollment the weaker version is close to enactment now the competing visions for the law reflect a similarly deep divide among economists one school of thought argues that simply unleashing the economy by allowing more foreign investment , selling off unprofitable stateowned companies and cutting red tape will reduce poverty more than a new government program they point to government estimates that the proportion of people living in poverty dropped from 36 percent to 26 percent of the population in the first decade after economic reforms , which began in 1991 where energy and policy should go is how to accelerate the growth , and not be distracted by these old slogans that really made sense 40 years ago , said surjit s bhalla , an economist who opposes the employment law the finance minister , palaniappan chidambaram , made a similar argument in an interview , saying that while an employment guarantee could keep the pot boiling once a day , it would not end poverty that could be done , he said , only through 7 to 8 percent annual growth and real jobs the counterargument is made by jean dreze , an economist of belgian origin who is now an indian citizen , and the employment guarantee s most vocal champion mr dreze says that even if the povertyreduction figures are valid , which many economists dispute , the economy would have to grow at a much faster rate than even the most optimistic estimates if it were to truly improve the lot of the poor the way we 're going now it is going to take forever to get people to an acceptable living standard , he said even 1 percent of gross domestic product the expected price tag for the employment law was a small price to pay for easing hunger , stemming seasonal migration and reducing child labor , he argued a national employment guarantee would absorb and supplant much of the patchwork quilt of antipoverty programs that the government has financed over the decades most of them offer food for labor on public works projects in many places , those programs have become essential buffers against drought and landlessness but they also have been plagued by waste and corruption , a record cited by those who argue that a nationwide employment program would funnel more money not to the poor but rather to corrupt politicians , bureaucrats and local power brokers mr dreze concedes there are abuses and waste , but says remedies could be made available a strong right to information law , for example that could allow local communities to monitor how public funds are used he was among those responsible for india s most significant social welfare expansion in recent years , the midday meal program , which resulted from a suit that challenged the government to use its vast stores of rice and wheat to alleviate hunger in response , the supreme court ordered the government to provide cooked lunches in all of the country s schools the program has so far reached only about 55 percent of indian children because several large states have lagged in putting it in place but where it has gone into effect , it has had a discernible impact teachers at the government primary school for boys in this town near delhi say the lunch usually a bolstering mix of lentils and rice has brought to school some 50 or 60 children who were otherwise regularly absent a study by the center for social equity in new delhi said the program had especially helped retain girls , who are often the first denied schooling in poor families improved child nutrition and encouraged mixing among castes but even some advocates for the poor question adding a new entitlement , like the proposed employment law , when many current ones , notably public health , are so badly administered public education too is in disarray , and while any schooling is better than none , it still seems odd to ask teachers here how much the midday meal program has improved learning , given how little learning is going on one building is crumbling so badly that it has not been used for five or six years in the other , newly built , all but one classroom is used to lock away benches and tables that the teachers say would be stolen if left outside so on a recent day , three classes of rambunctious boys sat on the sandy ground the teachers , earning about 230 a month , are decently paid by indian standards but on the day a reporter visited , only 5 of 11 teachers were present the rest had taken early leave for coming holidays for some children , then , the meal has taken on more value than their education the boys are supposed to bring their own plates , but many are too poor to do so so they line up with their miniblackboards , notebooks or schoolbooks held out the gruel is slopped on to their learning from the day
the billionaire hedgefund investor steven a cohen likes to keep his shopping sprees to himself but that s pretty difficult in today s gossipy art world , especially when he recently spent more than 100 million on two welldocumented paintings , one by vincent van gogh and the other by paul gauguin when the seller is another highprofile collector the las vegas casino owner stephen a wynn the transaction becomes all the more fascinating the paintings are van gogh s peasant woman against a background of wheat \( 1890 \) and gauguin s bathers \( 1902 \) , and they once hung in the bellagio gallery of fine art in las vegas , which was founded by mr wynn , and were included in a 1999 catalog of the gallery s holdings \( when mr wynn sold mirage resorts to mgm grand in 2000 , mgm transformed the gallery from a place to show mr wynn s art collection to a kunsthalle , a museum without its own collection that presents loan exhibitions \) the sale of the van gogh and the gauguin was brokered by william acquavella , the manhattan dealer who has advised mr cohen and mr wynn over the years mr cohen would not discuss the transaction mr wynn did not return repeated phone calls mr acquavella declined to comment ed tagliaferri , a spokesman for mr cohen , at first said he would not comment , but then said that the 150 million figure mr cohen was rumored to have paid for the two paintings was too high \( people familiar with the negotiations said that they believed the correct amount was around 110 million \) the gauguin , one of that artist s signature tahitian images , is a colorful canvas that depicts a family of bathers in a lush landscape with the ocean in the background mr wynn bought the painting in the late 1990 s it had previously belonged to a member of the goulandris family , greek shippers known for their serious collecting the van gogh , a seated woman wearing a blue dress and straw hat and surrounded by stalks of wheat , was also bought by mr wynn in the 1990 s before his purchase it had had several owners , including the hahnloser collection from switzerland like many collectors , mr wynn is both a steady buyer and a steady seller he has parted with works by modigliani and c zanne , for example , at auction and in private sales mr cohen has sold his share of paintings , too two years ago he auctioned a c zanne still life at sotheby s but to the dealers who as a professional pastime watch mr cohen s transactions , his sales have not been as surprising as this latest round of purchases during the last five years he has spent more than 400 million on art he has snapped up postwar canvases , like a classic jackson pollock drip painting for 52 million , andy warhol s superman for 25 million and an early painting by francis bacon for 165 million he has also bought newer art , like damien hirst s 1991 work the physical impossibility of death in the mind of someone living , a 14foot tiger shark in a tank of formaldehyde , for which he paid 8 million most recently he has concentrated on contemporary art , collecting other pieces by mr hirst as well as prime examples of work by such trendy living artists as richard prince and tom friedman so why is he suddenly buying a van gogh and a gauguin \? when mr cohen began seriously collecting , he purchased several important impressionist and postimpressionist paintings , including one of monet s waterlilies from 1906 and a manet selfportrait from 1878 some dealers say he is once again looking back in time they suggest that mr cohen , ever the trader , may believe the contemporary market has become too overheated others dealers \( particularly those who specialize in cuttingedge contemporary art \) disagree , arguing that he is not abandoning one market for another but participating in both none would speak for attribution , because of mr cohen s importance as a client a double dose of sculpture the art program at madison square park that newly restored 62acre swath of green space between madison and fifth avenues from 23rd to 26th streets keeps growing it began slowly , four years ago , with a video installation by tony oursler now there are plans to show art there yearround and not just one artist at a time on oct 21 , 11 works by the minimalist sculptor jene highstein will join the two monumental sculptures by sol lewitt that were installed may 1 this show marks a big step forward for us , said debbie landau , executive director of the madison square park conservancy , a twoyearold group made up of neighborhood residents and business leaders we 're using the lawn and the planting beds as though they were rooms in a museum mr highstein s installation will consist of sculptures from 1988 to 2004 and made of cast iron , stone and wood i 've been messing around in the space for the last three months , mr highstein said in a telephone interview on wednesday i'm used to putting works in the landscape , but mostly sitespecific pieces mr highstein said that out of respect for mr lewitt , whose works do not address the landscape , he arranged his sculptures so that they circle the park from the northeast corner to the southwest corner , keeping the central lawn empty as a buffer between the two groupings he placed two sculptures fashioned from western red cedar , for example , in the northern end of the park i did n't want them to compete with the trees , mr highstein said but they 're quite architectural and play off the big oak trees there the older , cast iron works low cylindrical forms with slanting tops in smooth and textured black granite are in the park s southwestern triangle three of mr highstein s tornado pieces , funnelshaped forms in quartzite , are just north of the castiron works new at the new museum on tuesday the 28yearold new museum of contemporary art will break ground for its 35 million building at the bowery and prince street the 60 , 000squarefoot , sevenstory museum was designed by kazuyo sejima and ryue nishizawa , in partnership as sanaa of tokyo when the building opens in late 2007 , the museum will have a larger curatorial staff in june , lisa phillips , the museum s director , hired richard flood , chief curator of the walker art center in minneapolis , to be its chief curator this week she announced the appointment of laura hoptman as a curator ms hoptman was most recently curator of contemporary art at the carnegie museum of art in pittsburgh , where she organized the 20045 carnegie international earlier , she was an assistant curator of drawings at the museum of modern art rosenquist at acquavella although william acquavella has built his reputation by dealing in impressionist and postimpressionist art , his east 79th street gallery in manhattan also represents living artists , including lucian freud now the pop artist james rosenquist has agreed to be represented by mr acquavella in his long career , mr rosenquist had been represented by such high profile dealers as leo castelli and larry gagosian a show of his grisaille and monochrome works opened at acquavella galleries this week and continues through nov 11
the research firms that designed the 10 million polling system used by news organizations during last year s presidential election have concluded that the system erroneously showed john kerry to be leading the race not because of a technological breakdown but because of more human variables these included the relative youth of the pollsters , who were more successful securing interviews with supporters of mr kerry as they left polling places than with those of the actual winner , president bush the findings by the two firms , edison media research and mitofsky international , were in a 77page report released yesterday by the consortium of six news organizations five television networks and the associated press that had commissioned the new system the recommendations made by the research firms included the hiring of surveyors from a broader range of ages \( half of those who worked on election day were 34 or younger \) and doing a better job training those pollsters and working with individual communities to ensure that interviews could be conducted closer to voting sites while the consortium members generally praised the firms for the thoroughness of their analysis , representatives for the news organizations said they had not yet decided whether to retain edison and mitofsky for future elections such a decision is expected within the next month or so we are all making up our minds as to what the next move is , said john stack , vice president for newsgathering at fox news , one of the consortium members we know it is an imprecise system but we 're providing an important service for the american public we need to try to get the best product possible while any misimpression created by the flawed projections was corrected using counts of actual votes before newspapers printed the results and the networks broadcast them , some editors and producers have complained that they paid tens of thousands of dollars for a system that produced unusable results and that led them to make wrong decisions about allocating resources and coverage on election day we understand that the impression given by the results during the day did n't meet the results of what happened , an author of the report , joseph lenski , executive vice president of edison media research , said in an interview yesterday in an effort to prevent a recurrence of what was the most visible dissemination of the flawed results leaks of the data , beginning in the early afternoon , to various web logs the consortium , the national election pool , announced yesterday that it would delay the release to news organizations of voter survey results during future elections by five hours until 6 pm , eastern time mr lenski said that none of the news organizations that commissioned the system the three main broadcast networks , cnn , fox news and the ap had asked for their money back as a result of its flawed performance of the dozens of other news organizations that subscribed to the service , mr lenski said that only one , the new york times , had requested a partial refund catherine mathis , a spokeswoman for the times , said that bill keller , the executive editor , had written a letter to the consortium after the election expressing our sense that we were illserved ms mathis said that mr keller s request for a partial refund had been refused and that the paper s editors were reviewing whether to use the service in future elections don frederick , national political editor of the los angeles times , said his paper intended to undertake a similar review before deciding whether to pay for the consortium s results in the future in the end , he said , the polling of voters on election day regarding the presidential race had been of little assistance to the paper s reporters and editors as they plotted their coverage that day as we walk up toward the '08 campaign , the political desk of our paper would want a further debriefing of what went wrong , mr frederick said the new system was constructed after a precursor , the voter news service , contributed to the networks' calling of florida in the 2000 election first for al gore , then for george w bush , then for neither while the new system avoided those pitfalls , the researchers found that their projections overstated the votes won by mr kerry in 26 states , while overstating the votes won by mr bush in four the system was not without its technical glitches on election day for example , the research firms found that at least in the early afternoon , the system overstated the proportion of women in the electorate , a problem apparently caused by a programming error in positing why the overstatements of mr kerry s performance were so pronounced , the researchers said they were convinced that the technical foundation on which their work was based was sound instead , the report concluded that at least some of the breakdown was rooted in the interactions between some pollsters and some voters in general , the surveys appeared to overrepresent younger voters , who tended to vote for mr kerry , and to underrepresent older voters , who tended to vote for mr bush in analyzing the results , the researchers were careful to indicate that there was no evidence that the surveyors had embarked on any conscious effort to skew the vote the researchers focused instead on the median age of the surveyors , 34 , and they hypothesized that perhaps younger voters felt more comfortable than older voters submitting questionnaires to younger surveyors
to prepare for a mammoth role like martha the heavydrinking , husbandbashing , guestmolesting , childinventing termagant wife of a history professor in who s afraid of virginia woolf \? some actresses might train with a boxing coach , consult textbooks on marital abuse or study cockfights kathleen turner had her right knee replaced i wanted to be ready , she said in her whiskey baritone it s inevitably compared to some kind of liquor over lunch one day last month in boston , where the play was trying out \( it opens on broadway , at the longacre theater , tonight \) but really , i 've been getting ready ever since college back then i told myself , when i'm 50 , this is my role and guess what , the week i turned 50 , last june , they gave it to me ms turner s iwasborntoplaymartha routine seems intended to obviate questions about her stepping into a role so famously played by the likes of uta hagen on broadway in 1962 and elizabeth taylor in the 1966 movie when asked what sustained her confidence for more than 30 years , she merely tossed her head back and brayed her big martha laugh , just as she had done when courting edward albee the play s producer , elizabeth i mccann , remembers hearing ms turner emit that overscaled roar at a meeting with the playwright and thinking , i do n't know if that was calculated or not , but she just got the part she was not the first to make the pilgrimage mr albee said that at least six wellknown actresses had read for him in the last six years and that several others , who did not read , were discussed jessica lange , mercedes ruehl , christine lahti , kate nelligan , frances mcdormand , judith ivey , stockard channing , patti lupone and bette midler are among the names in one or the other category none of them was a slouch , mr albee added , but either they were too old or too young or did n't have the right chemistry with the men under consideration among them bill irwin , jeff daniels , jonathan pryce , john lithgow and ed harris to play martha s husband , george not in a hurry , mr albee kept writing new plays until , last june , at the chelsea loft of the director anthony page , he heard in ms turner and mr irwin an echo of the revelation that he had felt years ago when the parts were read by ms hagen and arthur hill mr page said ms turner seemed rather like martha even before she spoke a look of voluptuousness , a woman of appetites , yes , he said but a look of having suffered as well three hours after the reading , ms turner and mr irwin had the parts ms turner had campaigned not only for the role but also for the health to play it it s strange to think of her as in any way handicapped for 10 years , from her jawdropping movie debut in 1981 in body heat until 1990 , when she returned to broadway as a wellreceived maggie in cat on a hot tin roof , she built a career on adventurousness and frank sexuality borne of robust physicality the variety and even athleticism of her roles during that decade \( including romancing the stone , prizzi s honor , peggy sue got married , the accidental tourist , who framed roger rabbit and the war of the roses \) made sense of the fact that she 'd been a gymnast in her teens , running at everything fullforce i 've always been accused of being a little too much , she said , and that was part of her glamour she was a certifiable diva , uncowed by twit costars and smarmy producers she nevertheless maintained the oddball selfconsciousness of the tall and deepvoiced girl she once was , the one who sang in the boys' choir in elementary school and whose accent \( a mixture of spanish inflection patterns , british consonants and american vowels acquired piecemeal as her diplomat father dragged his family from missouri to canada , cuba , venezuela and london \) was deliciously strange and stagy but having aged out of hollywood leadinglady roles at 36 her movie career began to disintegrate , and so did her health there s no question that something went terribly wrong for ms turner , but she has over time expanded her explanation of exactly what it was it s clear that while shooting serial mom in 1993 \( doing a john waters film is almost a sure sign of career trauma \) she began to suffer what she called unbearable pain by the time she was finally diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis , she could hardly turn her head or walk , and was told she would end up in a wheelchair treated with heavy steroids and chemotherapy , she started looking puffy and unsteady rumors began circulating that she was drinking too much she later said in interviews that she did n't bother correcting the rumors because people in show business hire drunks all the time , but not people who are sick keeping her condition a secret was n't easy during the broadway run of indiscretions in 1995 , she managed to walk up a spectacular threestory stairway in high heels at every performance , but needed five minutes alone at the top to cry working , i could ignore the pain , she said offstage i could n't her condition was eventually brought under control by new drugs including one called enbrel , whose manufacturers paid her to appear on television shows discussing rheumatoid arthritis and her recovery from it she never mentioned the drug by name , but did not reveal her ties to the companies either after an interview on cnn in 2002 , the network announced a change of policy requiring full disclosure of such arrangements there is something actorly in her ability to spin new and sometimes contradictory histories with equal conviction in response to those old drinking rumors , for instance , she no longer pretends that rheumatoid arthritis was the only thing wrong instead she confirms what was widely reported at the time that a few weeks after she finished her contract as mrs robinson in the broadway production of the graduate in 2002 , she checked herself into a rehab facility , saying she wanted to quit drinking for my husband , my child and my career \( she has been married to jay weiss , a real estate developer , since 1984 they have a daughter , rachel , now 17 \) i have no problem with alcohol when i'm working , she added it s when i'm home alone that i ca n't control my drinking yeah , that was interesting to me , she reflected , pausing to swirl a glass of iced tea i 'd had a night where i blacked out and stuff a monday , an off night , she hastened to add it scared the hell out of me and i decided that when the play was over i would try well , i believe in preventive medicine so i booked myself to a place i went to learn i learned a lot about denial , about the pressures of a society that s hypocritical about pleasure there s no sin to having a nice glass of wine with a good meal , but you 're forced into a kind of secrecy about it , which i felt i was falling into i felt like i was going that direction , you know \? i was going toward excess i mean , really ! i think i was losing my control over it so it pulled me back mr albee suggests that since the drama of virginia woolf is stoked by alcohol , ms turner s knowledge of its power might be part of her effectiveness in the play i think every experience you can bring to a role helps , he said , as long as you do n't do it in the role and she s been totally sober and on target ms turner said her experiences in rehab did help her understand how martha can so easily cross various boundaries from needling to clubbing , from flirting to mauling , from damaging to destroying without realizing it she has a very thin civilized veneer that s ripped off by drinking , she said but the drinking itself is n't the drama it s the waste of her life there s nothing she can do she sits in this house , day after day after day i 'd go mad you know \? i 'd go out of my mind or turn into a feral alcoholic , you know \? she paused , then went on breezily and at the moment i feel very strongly that i do n't want any confusion between the role and my life , so the best thing to do is to completely abstain because i do n't want to behave like martha and i do n't want to think that s ok i need a real distance here , offstage and on , and the best way to do that right now is to simply not do what she does the woman who once told interviewers that she was not a very kind person \( her indiscretions costar eileen atkins called her an amazing nightmare \) is now universally liked among the virginia woolf company to everyone s surprise , the part of martha she feels she has to work hardest at is the viciousness i do n't like to be that way , she explained mr page said she s had an easier time with the exuberant and maternal side of the character and is learning to be lethal and mr irwin , who called her a tough number but a good soul , suggested that she had deliberately set about , early on , to puncture her reputation for intimidation at one point she said to me , 'you know i get grumpy when i do n't get enough blood sugar , ' which was such a gracious and informative thing to say , he recalled and i found myself sharing news about body functions equally with her , and step by step we grew close when anthony recently said we now seemed married , i found it scary but took it as a compliment however haggard and hippy she looks onstage , offstage she is trim enough to get away with tight jeans , a fitted sweater and sneakers at the ritzcarlton the steroid bloat is gone , leaving behind a pretty but clearly 50yearold face constant physical therapy \( plus the new knee \) keeps her fit enough to withstand the rigors of the show , though she appears to have integrated some lingering stiffness into an aptly tipsy stagger for martha beyond that , whether because of maturity or sobriety i miss wine , she said , i miss good wine she is almost ostentatiously down to earth in fact , according to ms mccann , the producer , ms turner has exerted pull exactly once to insist that david harbour and mireille enos , who round out the company as nick and honey , be given billing in the show s advertisements we 're not contractually obligated to do so , ms mccann said , but she said that was n't good enough despite the ravages of disease and time and hollywood , ms turner still wants to be good enough at all costs when she came down with bronchitis at the end of the boston run and had to miss the final performance , it was awful for her , ms mccann said she was crying because she felt she let everyone down there s also the sense \( as there is in martha \) of a girl still wanting to be noticed by a beloved but remote father my father was of missionary stock , she said , so theater and acting were just one step up from being a streetwalker , you know \? so when i was performing in school , he would drive my mom and sit in the car she 'd come out at intermissions and tell him , she s doing very well ' ms turner s father died of a massive heart attack just after she left for drama school she says her fondest wish in life would be to see him again , and somehow in that longing you understand why she hates to miss shows , why she did not ask the producers of virginia woolf to hire \( as the producers of the original broadway production did \) a separate matinee cast to relieve the burden of the grueling play \( instead , every other week , they 'll reduce the schedule from eight to seven performances \) when asked about this , ms turner reprised her martha roar not to be there feels like cheating , she explained and it just seems wrong not to offer , well , me 'who s afraid of virginia woolf' longacre theater 228 west 48th street , opening tonight
the university club of larchmont , which exists partly to sponsor college scholarships at mamaroneck high school , will soon be awarding this year s supply of cash to qualified students of both sexes and this week , after 78 years in existence , it may also decide to offer membership to women currently , any man over 21 who has completed at least two years of college and resides in the area is eligible for membership approximately 225 residents of larchmont and mamaroneck now belong , says paul massey , who is responsible for membership each member s annual dues , 100 , supports the group s scholarships efforts , though additional voluntary contributions bolster the total the group has no overhead there is no actual clubhouse members pay to attend dinnertime meetings , where speakers have included former cabinet officials like andrew cuomo and harold brown , as well as regional luminaries like district attorney jeanine pirro \( they have spoken free of charge \) although admitting women would be a major change , the university club of larchmont is hardly the augusta national golf club no local women have stormed the meetings in fact spouses and other female guests have long been welcome at the dinners nor are any women s organizations agitating for change instead , says mr massey , the move to go coed arose from the applications of two local women , drawn by the range and prominence of club speakers and what may surprise some , both among the membership and in the community at large , is that the change was brought about in part by two of the club s older members , f \? cien steichen , 78 , and louis del guercio , 76 the men , both surgeons , are sponsoring one of the applicants , patricia loubeau , a professor at iona college , whom dr del guercio described as a wellknown hospital administrator and teacher we put her application in , he said , but it was put in abeyance because there was no authorization for electing women the whole question of sex was a nonissue for the doctors as dr steichen put it , people think surgeons are male chauvinists , but we are not still , the change could have been made on previous occasions about 10 years ago , a similar amendment came up for a vote but did n't pass , said randle carpenter , a past president three years ago , the group s board of governors considered admitting women , because we thought it was the right thing to do , said eric ploumis , president at the time but in the absence of any request by a woman to be a member , he added , we did not put it to a vote of the full membership ms loubeau said she had gravitated toward the club because of the speakers she is a founding member of food and thought , a local group that invites national politicians , journalists and scholars to luncheon meetings , and thought that attending university club dinners would enable her to vet prospective speakers she had not intended to break new ground by applying , but she does n't mind being first i was one of the first women presidents of a hospital administrators' group , she said , adding that in my profession , they respect knowledge and competence , and sex is irrelevant none of the club members interviewed expressed any opposition to the plan the nine men who serve on the board of governors unanimously support the amendment , according to a letter sent out this month announcing the impending vote the governors looked at the club s charter and saw no reason to exclude women , said bruce habig , the current president we thought we ought to make the effort to open it up in accordance with modern times two other local clubs that historically were single sex have already gone coed the league of women voters admits men , says its president , anne herman , who added that chapters throughout the county have had male board members and even presidents the local garden club also allows men , says its president , susan keppler , though it currently has none even the local women s club has no bylaw prohibiting men , said camille odierna , a member as for the university club , expanding the membership will only enhance scholarship efforts the club has no endowment , and no affiliation with the university club in manhattan , said paul winick , who heads the scholarship committee scholarships are awarded on the basis of academic achievement , extracurricular activities and community involvement , although in most cases candidates must also demonstrate financial need the club halved the honorarium a number of years ago to increase amount of scholarships based on need , said mr winick , adding we fill in the cracks in the student s financial aid package our schedule is set up so that other scholarship institutions have acted and we know the complete package so that we can put the money where it will do the most good last year , he said , the club gave out 36 , 000 to 26 students photos from left , paul winick , greg miller and josh klein of the university club interview jonathan alshuler , a mamaroneck high school senior , for a scholarship qualified girls are getting scholarships , too and women may be allowed to join \( photographs by susan farley for the new york times \)
berlin having spent the last 10 days traveling to britain , france , germany and switzerland , i have one small suggestion for president bush i suggest that when he comes to europe to mend fences next month he give only one speech it should be at his first stop in brussels and it should consist of basically three words read my ears let me put this as bluntly as i can there is nothing that the europeans want to hear from george bush , there is nothing that they will listen to from george bush that will change their minds about him or the iraq war or us foreign policy mr bush is more widely and deeply disliked in europe than any us president in history some people here must have a good thing to say about him , but i have n't met them yet in such an environment , the only thing that mr bush could do to change people s minds about him would be to travel across europe and not say a single word but just listen if he did that , mr bush would bowl the europeans over he would absolutely disarm and flummox people here and improve his own image markedly all it would take for him would be just a few words read my ears i have come to europe to listen , not to speak i will give my europe speech when i come home after i 've heard what you have to say if mr bush did that none of the european pundits would be able to pick apart his speeches here and mock the contradictions between his words and deeds none of them would comment on his delivery and what he failed to mention instead , all the european commentators , politicians and demonstrators would start fighting with one another over what to say to the president it might even force the europeans to get out of their bad habit of just saying , george bush , and everybody laughing or sneering as if that ends the conversation , and europe does n't have to declare what it stands for listening is also a sign of respect it is a sign that you actually value what the other person might have to say if you just listen to someone first , it is amazing how much they will listen to you back most europeans , though , are convinced that george bush is deaf that he cannot listen or hear just proving that he is not deaf , and therefore the europeans do n't have to shout , would do wonders for mr bush s standing what would mr bush hear \? some of it is classic eurowhining , easily dismissible but some of it is very heartfelt , even touching i heard it while doing interviews at the pony club , a trendy bar beauty parlor in east berlin and more and more i think it explains why many europeans dislike mr bush so intensely it s this europeans love to make fun of na ve american optimism , but deep down , they envy it and they want america to be that open , foreignerembracing , carefree , goofily enthusiastic place that cynical old europe can never be many young europeans blame mr bush for making america , since 9 11 , into a strange new land that exports fear more than hope , and has become dark and brooding a place whose greeting to visitors has gone from give me your tired , your poor to give me your fingerprints they look at mr bush as someone who stole something precious from them tim kreutzfeldt , the bar owner , said to me bush took away our america i mean we love america we are very sad about america we believe in america and american values , but not in bush and it makes us angry that he distorted our image of the country which is so important to us it is not what america stands for and this makes us angry and it should make every american angry , because america lost so much in its reputation worldwide the bush team , he added , is giving everyone in the world the impression that somebody is coming to kill you stefan elfenbein , a food critic nursing a beer at our table , added i know many people who do n't want to travel to america anymore people are afraid to be hassled at the border we all discuss it , when somebody goes to america we now ask 'are you sure \? ' we had hope that kerry would win and would make a statement , 'america is back to what it was four years ago' we hoped that he would be the symbol , the figure who would say , ' america is the country that welcomes everybody again' but now we have to wait four more years , hopefully for somebody to give us back the country we knew and liked yes , yes , there are legitimate counters to all these points but before anyone here will listen to mr bush make those counterpoints , he will have to really listen to them first
bethesda , md , jan 14 a food and drug administration advisory panel recommended against the overthecounter sale of a merck cholesterollowering drug , saying that while millions of americans could benefit from taking it , they should not begin such a regimen without a doctor s advice the fda typically heeds such recommendations , meaning that the drug industry has been at least temporarily thwarted from creating a new segment of the drug market but merck and its partner in the application , johnson johnson , said they would continue trying to win approval the companies had sought to sell a nonprescription version of mevacor , one of the oldest of the class of drugs known as statins with the support of some cardiologists , the companies argued that overthecounter statins could benefit many of the estimated 39 million people whose blood cholesterol might put them at moderate risk of a heart attack but who are reluctant to spend the time and money getting a doctor s prescription despite the panel s lopsided vote against recommending approval 20 to 3 even several members who voted no said they liked the idea of selling cholesterol drugs over the counter but would need more data an advisory panel rejected similar applications in 2000 for both mevacor and pravachol , by bristolmyers squibb , concluding that the medical management of cholesterol should be done under a doctor s care an approval of overthecounter sale of a statin might have opened the door to companies' being able to extend their exclusive rights to namebrand statins even after their patents expire and generic prescription versions enter the market if a namebrand drug is approved for overthecounter sale , a company has exclusive rights to sell it without competition from generic overthecounter versions mevacor , whose patent has already expired , is no longer a big seller for merck more important to merck would be eventual overthecounter approval for its zocor , which is no2 in the statin market behind lipitor , by pfizer , which goes off patent next year bristolmyers squibb , whose pravachol is no3 in sales and also goes off patent next year , said last month that it was once again planning to seek fda approval for overthecounter sales but if such approval is to come , drug companies would evidently need to make a more persuasive case than merck and johnson johnson were able to muster with mevacor i think the committee was relatively comfortable with the idea that these drugs would reduce risks and would reduce the hazard of this problem , said one of the panelists , alastair wood , a professor at vanderbilt university medical center in nashville but the quality of the data supporting that was inadequate several panel members said they would be more likely to approve a nonprescription statin for behindthecounter sale , in which no prescription would be required but a pharmacist must approve the drug s use such a sales category exists in britain but is not currently used in this country dr charles ganley , head of the fda s division of overthecounter products , said friday at a news conference after the hearing that behindthecounter sales were worth exploring , but cautioned that creating that new category might require congressional approval approval of an overthecounter statin would also represent a departure from the current system of dispensing nonprescription drugs mainly for symptomatic relief only some physicians had predicted that approval of an overthecounter statin would have been the first step toward overthecounter blood pressure and diabetes medications this was the paradigm shift that said we were going to overthecounter drugs to prevent disease , said dr wood , the advisory panel s chairman , who cast one of the three votes for approval the reality is that the vast majority of these patients are receiving no therapy now , and should be the companies , which planned to market overthecounter mevacor 20milligram doses , had said that the target audience was 15 million to 20 million people they would be men 45 and older and women 55 and older , with ldl or bad cholesterol levels of 130 to 170 and at least one other cardiovascular risk factor the company had estimated that three million to five million people would take the drug the panel s decision against the drug was based largely on a marketing study that the two companies submitted in support of their proposal in that study , the companies set up 14 simulated storefront drugstores across the country where 3 , 316 people were given the chance to decide whether to take mevacor without a prescription of those , 1 , 061 decided to buy it the company s analysis concluded that more than 80 percent made the correct decision to purchase the drug , after analyzing their risk factors but the fda analysis concluded that the figure was more like 55 percent some who asked for the drug were too young , according to that analysis , others did not know their cholesterol levels and some had medical conditions that should have prevented its use and others consulted with their doctors even though the drug was supposed to be over the counter of particular concern to panel members was that in these simulated drugstores , some women of childbearing age decided to take the drug in testimony before the panel yesterday morning , a physician from the national genome research institute , dr robin j edison , presented evidence that statins were associated with serious central nervous system birth defects when women took them in the first trimester of pregnancy some panelists said a warning label advising pregnant women not to take the drug would not be adequate if you did n't plan on becoming pregnant , you are taking the medication , and the warning is too late for you , said dr leslie clapp , a buffalo pediatrician none of the panel members said they were worried about serious muscle or liver function problems with mevacor , which is one of the earlier , lowstrength statins the use of some newer , stronger statins has been associated with a potentially fatal musclewasting condition called rhabdomyolysis but several panel members said they were concerned that the availability of a lowdose statin in drugstores would cause some patients to forgo the more intensive therapy they might actually require dr boisey barnes , a washington physician , raised that same issue from the floor during the panel s public testimony session he also voiced concerns that people who buy statins over the counter would not make other , more important changes a healthy lifestyle , lowfat diet and exercise may achieve the same results of otc statins , he said correction january 19 , 2005 , wednesday because of an editing error , an article in business day on saturday about a federal panel s recommendation against overthecounter sales of a merck cholesterollowering drug , mevacor , misstated the patent status of a similar drug , lipitor , made by pfizer its patent expires in 2011 , not next year the patent of a separate merck cholesterol drug , zocor , expires next year
washington , nov 14 top federal drug officials decided to reject an application to allow overthecounter sales of the morningafter pill months before a government scientific review of the application was completed , according to accounts given to congressional investigators the government accountability office , a nonpartisan investigative arm of congress , concluded in a report released monday that the food and drug administration s may 2004 rejection of the morningafter pill , or emergency contraceptive , application was unusual in several respects top agency officials were deeply involved in the decision , which was very , very rare , a top fda review official told investigators the officials' decision to ignore the recommendation of an independent advisory committee as well as the agency s own scientific review staff was unprecedented , the report found and a top official s novel rationale for rejecting the application contradicted past agency practices , it concluded the pill , called plan b , is a flashpoint in the debate over abortion , in part because some abortion opponents consider the pill tantamount to ending a pregnancy in scientific reviews , the fda has concluded that it is a contraceptive the report suggested that it quickly became apparent that the agency was not going to follow its usual path when it came to the pill for example , it said , fda review staff told us that they were told early in the review process that the decision would be made by highlevel management top agency officials denied many of the report s findings , including its conclusion that the top officials' involvement was unusual and that they had decided to reject the application before the agency s own scientific review was concluded julie zawisza , an fda spokeswoman , said the agency stood by its rejection of the morningafter pill application we question the integrity of the investigative process that results in such partial conclusions by the gao , ms zawisza said earlier this month , after senator patty murray , democrat of washington , denounced the agency s decisions on the pill , health and human services secretary michael o leavitt also said the agency had acted appropriately but on monday , dr susan f wood , former director of the agency s office of women s health , said that what she described as the fda s willingness to ignore science in the service of abortion politics has only gotten worse since the events that were the focus of the gao investigation dr wood resigned in august after the agency decided to delay its decision on the morningafter pill once again senator murray and senator hillary rodham clinton , democrat of new york , issued a statement saying that the report has confirmed what we have always suspected , that this was a politically motivated decision that came down from the highest levels at the fda the investigation was requested by 30 house members and 17 senators on monday , 18 democratic house members signed a letter of protest to mr leavitt the letter noted that congressional investigators had been unable to uncover the role in the plan b decision played by the former agency commissioner , dr mark b mcclellan , because agency officials told investigators that all of his email messages and written correspondence on the subject had been deleted or thrown out the democrats charged that these acts contravened federal records laws planned parenthood federation of america , the nation s largest provider of abortion services , issued a statement saying , the gao report confirms the fda has been playing politics with women s health all along wendy wright , executive vice president of concerned women for america , a conservative women s advocacy group in washington , said that the report s finding that top agency officials had overruled staffers was comforting the fda has been making some pretty serious mistakes lately , ms wright said plan b is manufactured by barr laboratories and is now available only with a prescription manufacturers rarely criticize the fda , fearing that doing so might anger agency officials carol cox , a barr spokeswoman , chose her words carefully while we 're disappointed that the fda has not approved plan b for overthecounter use , we continue to seek that approval , ms cox said plan b was originally manufactured by women s capital corporation , which won approval from the fda in 1999 to sell the drug by prescription the pill contains high doses of the medicines present in birth control pills if taken within 72 hours of unprotected sex , plan b generally prevents pregnancy but it is most effective taken soon after sex , prompting the efforts to make it available quickly and without a prescription in april 2003 , women s capital applied to make plan b available over the counter barr bought the rights to the drug and continued to pursue the application an advisory committed voted 23 to 4 in december 2003 to recommend approving the switch within days of the committee s vote , however , dr janet woodcock , the fda s acting deputy commissioner of operations , and dr steven galson , acting director of its drug center , told four top staff members that the application would be rejected , even though the agency s scientific review of the application had yet to be completed , the staff members told congressional investigators that review was completed in april drs woodcock and galson denied to investigators that they had made such statements dr galson told them that although he was '90 percent sure' as early as january 2004 that he would reject the application , he made his final decision only after reviewing the scientific evidence from 1994 to 2004 , fda advisory committees reviewed 23 applications to switch drugs from prescription to overthecounter status plan b was the only one of those 23 in which the agency went against the committee s advice dr galson said in a may 2004 news conference that while he had consulted other top officials at the agency , the decision to reject the plan b application was his alone he decided to issue a nonapprovable letter to barr , he said , because only 29 of 585 participants in a barr study of the drug had been ages 14 to 16 none was under 14 dr galson said younger teenagers might act differently than older ones and might engage in riskier sex if they knew an emergency contraceptive was easily available the company needed more data to ensure that this was not true , he said but the gao called this rationale novel and said it was not in keeping with earlier agency decisions in which the behavior of older adolescents was routinely used to predict that of younger ones the report also noted that the december 2003 advisory committee had voted 27 to 1 that barr s study had demonstrated that consumers , adolescents included , could use the drug appropriately in his rejection letter to barr , dr galson suggested two ways it could receive approval first , it could perform another study that included more young adolescents or it could seek to sell the drug behindthecounter , making it easily available only to women 16 and older , with younger women still needing a prescription barr took the second approach in an application filed in july 2004 although the agency s rules required it to issue a decision in january , it has delayed doing so indefinitely it is unusual for the agency to suggest a means of approval to an applicant only to decide later that its own suggestion might not be appropriate
alfred , ny peter jenkins trudged down a snowcovered country road recently , unconcerned with the frigid cold and wind from the worst storm of the season a group of college students , their heads down except to look out for snowplows , followed quite literally in his footsteps one of the few cars on the road slowed the driver lowered a frosted window to ask if the group needed help no thanks , christopher gordon , 20 , one of the students , shouted gleefully we 're out for a walk a walk across america with a confused and irritated look , the driver sped away no matter mr jenkins , 53 , often got a similar reaction 32 years ago when he began his first epic journey across the country he started that trip as a disenchanted young man , so upset by the vietnam war , watergate and the troubled state of race relations that he was ready to abandon america an older friend urged him to give the country a closer look so he began walking in october 1973 , starting in alfred , which is 300 miles northwest of manhattan , in the foothills of the allegheny mountains , accompanied by his dog , an alaskan malamute named cooper he finished his journey more than five years later , in january 1979 in florence , ore , a muchchanged man and something of a nationally recognized adventurer as he walked , camped , and took odd jobs to earn money for the next leg , mr jenkins lived briefly with some of the people he met and benefited from countless acts of generosity they came from mountain men , hardworking hippies , wealthy ranchers and struggling families a photo editor and a writer for national geographic magazine championed his journey after he and cooper showed up at the magazine s offices while walking through washington , dc they helped him chronicle his trip in two essays in national geographic , the first published in april 1977 , after mr jenkins had been on the road for three and a half years it struck a huge chord , like huckleberry finn , said the writer , harvey alger , who is now retired literary agents and book editors tracked down mr jenkins as he continued traveling later , he wrote two best sellers a walk across america told the first part of his journey from new york state to louisiana and is still required reading in many schools the walk west chronicled the second half through the rockies and the pacific northwest the anger and divisiveness in the country today reminds him of the vietnam war era and is , he said , the sad inspiration for a second journey it s time to take another look and see how americans have changed , he said on jan 22 , he began at the same starting point he chose the first time , his alma mater , alfred university he and eight students with whom he has talked for several months to broaden his understanding of today s youth walked eight miles to a place he described as a hippie hotel , pollywogg holler \( teepees and lodges heated by wood stoves are among the amenities \) they played cards and talked the next day , he escorted them safely back to campus \( the students , despite the boast made to the driver on the snowswept road , would not accompany him past this first leg \) two days later , mr jenkins had to interrupt the trip briefly when a close friend died of a heart attack mr jenkins doubled back for the funeral an experience that reminded him of his own mortality and the unpredictability of life as for the rest of the journey , who knows what may happen mr jenkins has no preset route and is not a man to get hung up on the details of traveling he is openminded about where he might go , how long he might stay and what he expects to find i want to spend more time over here , he said , looking at a map of the united states and sweeping his hand over oklahoma , nebraska , kansas and south dakota he will also revisit the places that profoundly changed him three decades ago , including the former home of homer davenport , a selfdescribed mountain man in chatham hill , va , and a commune farm in summertown , tenn , where his dog cooper died this time , he will not walk the whole way while he might walk for as many as 1 , 000 miles in a journey he expects will last 18 months , he will sometimes drive and also wants to travel using the means popular in some of the places he plans to visit he might venture to alaska and hop on a dog sled he is open to riding a horse through the ranchlands in the west he has a new motorcycle license , as does his son , jedidiah g jenkins , 22 , who will join him to explore parts unknown after he graduates from the university of southern california later this year i imagine we 'll be connecting with people , staying up until 5 am learning their deepest , darkest secrets , his son said nearly everything about the elder mr jenkins has changed since that first trip then , he was a college graduate who had chosen to major in art so he would not have to write many papers today , he is a successful writer then , he was a loner , a vegetarian and a pacifist today , he is the head of a large family , the owner of a cattle farm and a supporter of president bush and the war in iraq then , he had to battle for attention today , mr jenkins , who was in cades cove , tenn , in the great smoky mountains national park yesterday , has to battle against it turning down producers who wanted to make his trip a reality show , perhaps a more serious version of paris hilton and nicole richie s a simple life but none of that really matters mr jenkins has a plainspoken , earnest way about him that will help him connect with people and learn from them just as he did back then , said mr alger , the retired magazine writer , adding he s going to do a good job
over the last four decades , warren e buffett has built berkshire hathaway into one of the world s largest and most successful insurers along the way , he has navigated the stock market with legendary prowess and offered folksy guidelines for proper corporate governance now , with investigators on three continents examining berkshire affiliates and a deadline looming tomorrow to respond to an australian regulatory inquiry , mr buffett s company is in the unfamiliar position of having to defend its integrity berkshire insurance affiliates run by mr buffett s most trusted deputies are involved in what investigators describe as possible financial manipulation at insurance giants like the american international group and the zurich financial services group investigators are examining berkshire transactions that they say helped lead to the collapse four years ago of an insurance company involved in the biggest financial scandal in australian history investigators say they have traced many suspect transactions to a berkshire subsidiary in dublin , where at least two berkshire executives who were recently banned from the australian insurance market for engaging in abusive practices continue to work for the company investigators are trying to determine the extent of mr buffett s knowledge of the deals , which remains unclear the involvement of other senior executives based in the united states , ajit jain and joseph p brandon , and ron ferguson , a retired berkshire insurance executive , is also unclear all three men oversaw insurance operations that sold products at the core of international regulatory scrutiny none of the executives has been charged with wrongdoing the broad investigation into the insurance industry has already brought down top executives of other insurers , including maurice r greenberg , the former chief executive of the american international group aig directors are nearing a decision to cut all ties to him among other transactions , regulators are looking at a deal mr greenberg struck in late 2000 with the general re corporation , a unit of berkshire hathaway while many companies are being scrutinized , one person briefed on the various investigations described general re as at the center of the storm a berkshire spokesman declined to respond to questions about the executives , their business dealings or the investigations , other than to cite a statement from berkshire s most recent annual report operating decisions for the various berkshire businesses are made by managers of the business units investment decisions and all other capital allocation decisions are made for berkshire and its subsidiaries by warren e buffett to the extent that the statement distances mr buffett from mr jain , mr brandon , and mr ferguson all of whom report or reported directly to him it contrasts with mr buffett s description in his 2001 shareholder letter about his interactions with mr jain i have known the details of almost every policy that ajit has written since he came with us in 1986 , mr buffett wrote ajit s business will ebb and flow but his underwriting principles wo n't waver mr buffett has successfully dealt with scandals in the past berkshire invested heavily in salomon brothers in 1987 and four years later , mr buffett agreed to become the firm s interim chairman in the wake of a treasury trading scandal , and he quickly cleaned house although he is best known for multibilliondollar returns on investments in cocacola , the washington post , gillette and other concerns , his company , berkshire , is an omaha holding company that owns major insurers including national indemnity and general re mr buffett , 74 , is a selfdescribed devotee of the insurance business who relishes the challenge of assessing risks and offering policyholders protection from daily mishaps like auto accidents to more exotic catastrophes like hurricanes as berkshire s insurance offerings have evolved , it has crafted ever more esoteric products that in theory exist to help users insulate themselves financially from the world s calamities but in practice , law enforcement officials and regulators say , users have deployed these same products to manipulate corporate earnings or mask underlying financial woes the securities and exchange commission the justice department the new york attorney general , eliot spitzer and regulators in ireland , britain and australia are all shining investigative spotlights on arcane products known as finite reinsurance with general re figuring in each of those investigations fitch ratings , a firm that monitors insurers , criticized finite reinsurance in a recent report , noting that its primary purpose is not true risk transfer in the traditional sense , but financial statement enhancement analysts and regulators said that investigations of the improper use of finite reinsurance were still in their early stages but that in many instances the suspect buck stopped at berkshire s door at the end of the day , in terms of the finite universe that fitch is aware of , berkshire hathaway has deep roots into this market , said michael j barry , a managing director at fitch they 're one of the biggest sellers and it s just not here in the us it s global reinsurance is protection insurers buy for themselves to limit their own exposure to large claims finite reinsurance is used to soften the impact of claims that may have to be paid out over a particularly long period investigators and regulators said that some reinsurers have used finite products as substitutes for bank loans , selling them to companies that want to artificially pump up their books the perils of that game have surfaced in charges of financial manipulation and a number of prominent insurance failures australian regulators said that a troubled company named fai used finite products to feign profitability shortly before hih insurance ltd , a fastgrowing australian conglomerate , bought it in 1998 hih later toppled beneath the weight of illconsidered acquisitions like fai and other problems according to regulators , general re , the berkshire affiliate , sold suspect finite products to fai in 1998 when mr ferguson was the unit s chief executive another berkshire unit , national indemnity , sold a questionable finite product to fai in 1998 , when mr jain was overseeing the unit that transaction included a side letter that required fai not to seek payment on the policy for three years regulators consider side letters red flags because they mitigate the risk transfer in finite reinsurance and essentially repackage the product as a shortterm loan used to spruce up an income statement although berkshire itself acquired general re in 1998 after the first fai transaction , mr ferguson served as general re s chairman and chief executive from 1987 to 2001 he remained as chairman until retiring in 2002 berkshire s mr brandon , who joined general re in 1989 and became the insurer s chief financial officer in 1991 , has been the unit s chief executive since late 2001 when mr ferguson was succeeded as chief executive by mr brandon in 2001 , mr buffett offered praise for both men ron has exemplified integrity , professionalism and leadership , mr buffett said at the time in selecting the people i want to work with and who have run businesses for me , i look for the very same qualities that i would want to see in a man who was going to marry my daughter ron passes this test with flying colors i have great confidence in joe brandon s leadership abilities , mr buffett added , reinsurance expertise and financial skills , and look forward to working closely with him and general re s next generation of leaders insurance premiums accounted for about 21 billion of berkshire s 743 billion in revenue last year general re represents one of berkshire s four main insurance units and contributed about a third of the premiums berkshire booked as revenue last year , but it has been plagued by large underwriting losses in recent years in october , australian regulators barred six general re executives from the country s insurance industry for improprieties related to the fai transaction two of them , john houldsworth and tore ellingsen , continue to work for cologne re , a general re division based in dublin in december , australian regulators barred another general re executive , milan vukelic , for the fai deal , but reinstated him on appeal mr vukelic is now the chief executive of the faraday group , a general re unit based in london mr houldsworth , mr ellingsen and mr vukelic did not respond to phone calls seeking comment regulators and investigators said that most of berkshire s questionable finite products sold in australia and elsewhere originated in a general re division known as the alternative solutions group , which is based in dublin ireland is among the world s friendliest jurisdictions for reinsurers , offering a regulatory environment that some analysts have criticized as overly loose and forgiving ireland established a new monitoring agency , the irish financial services regulatory authority , in 2003 in response to these concerns regulators said the agency is currently investigating general re s operations in ireland mr spitzer was in dublin last week to give a speech on corporate governance mr spitzer s office is investigating a questionable finite transaction between general re and aig that originated in dublin in late 2000 and early 2001 and involved mr ferguson the attorney general s office said the deal artificially increased aig s premium reserves and helped it acquire another company mr buffett and mr greenberg , the former aig chief , have been friendly rivals over the years and they banded together in an unsuccessful attempt to buy the portfolio of long term capital management , a hedge fund that roiled financial markets when it nearly collapsed in 1998 the sec and mr spitzer s office issued subpoenas to berkshire , general re and berkshire s other insurance affiliates in december and january other problems have cropped up for general re it sold a questionable finite product to an australian unit of zurich financial , a swiss insurer buffeted by financial woes , and australian regulators are investigating that transaction a zurich financial spokesman confirmed the investigation but declined to comment other than to say the deal occurred between 2000 and 2002 australian regulators recently told general re that the company has until tomorrow to show cause why it should not face further investigations for finite dealings in australia meanwhile , the justice department is investigating general re for questionable policies it sold to reciprocal of america , a failed malpractice insurer that operated in the south tennessee and virginia regulators have also sued general re for fraud , contending that the company sold finite policies to reciprocal that masked financial problems at the company in addition to fitch , standard poor s , another major ratings agency , has voiced misgivings about finite reinsurance while also pointing out its belief that most finite products have legitimate and important uses a spokesman for the reinsurance association of america , an industry trade group , said that reinsurers were working with state regulators and law enforcement officials to develop a response to the recent round of investigations but that the industry does not believe that its accounting and disclosure practices need repair an individual with direct knowledge of berkshire s finances said finite reinsurance accounts for just 1 percent of the company s overall earnings and that the business does not propel its growth so far , all the inquiries have not been much of a drag on berkshire s stock even so , the legal risks and possible damage to its reputation that berkshire has incurred as a finite vendor may be costly from an investigative perspective we 're probably at the top of the fourth inning , said mr barry of fitch there s a lot more that we expect to happen
santa barbara , calif , aug 24 for half a century , birdwatchers have longed for a glimpse of the ivorybilled woodpecker , a bird long given up for extinct but recently rediscovered in arkansas now they may be able to hear it on wednesday , at the annual meeting of the american ornithologists' union here , a cornell researcher played newly recorded sounds that were believed to come from an ivory bill a toytrumpet call sounding like the word kent and a double knock on wood , made when the woodpecker hammers a tree it was these sounds that persuaded some skeptics this month to withdraw a critical paper and state that they were now convinced of the bird s existence the sounds are online at the web site of the cornell lab of ornithology www birds cornell edu russ a charif , a research biologist at the lab who played the sounds at the meeting , did not claim that they were conclusive proof of the bird s existence there is further analysis to do and more acoustical evidence to gather , mr charif said but together with a blurred , heavily analyzed video , and personal sightings , the evidence for the bird s existence is now conclusive , he said john fitzpatrick , the head of the cornell lab , said after the presentation that the researchers were not retreating from their conclusion that at least one ivory bill existed in arkansas , that it was the weight of the combined evidence that had convinced him the ivorybilled woodpecker , the largest american woodpecker , starkly patterned in black , white and red , had acquired near mythical status as a reminder of lost southern forests until it was sighted twice in february 2004 in the cache river national wildlife refuge although other sightings had been made since the last documented one roughly 50 years ago in louisiana none were confirmed and accepted by ornithologists in 2004 an ivory bill was sighted by timothy gallagher of the cornell lab and bobby harrison of oakwood college in huntsville , ala , as they searched the cache river refuge in a canoe both men had been pursuing the bird for years and had gone to this area because of a report from gene sparling of hot springs , ark , who thought he had seen it while kayaking earlier in the month the sighting by two expert birders led to a extensive but secret search and an announcement in april 2005 at a news conference and in an article in the journal science that the bird had been found serious doubts were later voiced by other ornithologists and birders , including richard o prum of yale and mark robbins of the university of kansas about the evidence presented in the science paper but dr prum and dr robbins were convinced of the bird s existence after they were provided the recordings that mr charif played on wednesday the recordings were from the cache river and the white river national wildlife refuges , and dr prum and dr robbins were still not convinced that the science paper , which had not used the recordings as evidence , was conclusive but since the larger point was moot , they withdrew a critical response to that paper mr charif said after his talk that the kent sounds alone were not conclusive because scientists could not completely rule out a blue jay mimicking the sound of an ivory bill , and that there was no earlier definitive recording of the double rap our interpretation is that they provide suggesting and tantalizing evidence , he said of the recordings we regard the video as being conclusive , he said , even though it was the acoustic recordings that had persuaded skeptics who found the video analysis lacking the recordings were made from december 2004 to may 2005 with remote recording units in the cache river and white river refuges the 18 , 000 hours of recordings were combed , first by computer and then by humans , to pick out more than 50 double knocks and several kent calls these were more thoroughly analyzed and compared to known ivory bill recordings , and double knocks of similar species outside of the united states
andr nico luksic , a chilean billionaire who built one of latin america s biggest business empires , died aug 18 in chile he was 78 years old his death was reported by antofagasta plc , the company where he had served as chairman until his retirement last year mr luksic once controlled a sprawling collection of mining , banking , telecommunications , manufacturing and beer companies most of the companies were in south america , but he also owned beach resorts in croatia , the country his father had emigrated from in the early 1900 s mr luksic claimed his fortune was born from a misunderstanding as a young man , he sold his stake in a copper mine to japanese investors who thought he was quoting them a price in dollars when in fact the amount he had proposed was in pesos mr luksic was too embarrassed to point out the discrepancy , fearing that he would be considered a rube for asking so little i thought for sure they would figure it out , he said in a 2002 interview with el mercurio , the chilean newspaper but they did not , and the mistake meant that mr luksic was paid 500 , 000 , more than 10 times the money he had asked for born on nov 5 , 1926 , andr nico luksic abaroa grew up in antofagasta , then a dusty desert town in northern chile , where his father owned a general store his parents were affluent enough to send their son to the sorbonne in paris but his stint at the famed university was shortlived on the first day of classes , his professor asked mr luksic to stand up and give a brief , impromptu speech about his native chile the young man was so unbearably shy that he fled the room and never returned back in chile , mr luksic studied law to please his parents but his discomfort in publicly arguing court cases led him to renounce the law as a career through a relative , he acquired a ford dealership in antofagasta , which was becoming a boomtown because of copper mining in the surrounding atacama desert an amateur geologist who enjoyed long , lonely walks to collect ore samples , mr luksic later bought a controlling share of a small copper mine whose owners were feuding it was this mine that he sold in 1954 to the nippon mining company for the unexpected windfall i burned 20 packages of votary candles to my three favorite saints pancras , judas and anthony , mr luksic said then i deposited the 500 , 000 in a bank as collateral to finance new businesses over the next 16 years , mr luksic expanded into fishing and mining , and moved to santiago , the chilean capital , where his successful stock market investments helped him gain control of empresas lucchetti sa , a pasta maker , and madeco sa , a leading metal manufacturer a workaholic , mr luksic discovered a novel way to combine business and family obligations when i came home from the office , i would jump into bed and have my five children and wife sit around me , and i would tell them everything i had done that day , in great detail , he said i soon realized that these talks were a way to help me figure out business problems like many chilean entrepreneurs , mr luksic saw his fortunes suffer when president salvador allende , a democratically elected marxist , took power in 1970 and carried out wholesale nationalizations eager to protect his most profitable businesses , mr luksic agreed to sell other companies cheaply to the allende government , much to the displeasure of the chilean business community , which opposed any state takeovers as a result , when general augusto pinochet came to power in 1973 coup , mr luksic was barred from investing in the first wave of stateowned companies put up for auction but events soon moved in his favor in the early 1980 s , a financial crisis set off a recession and widespread bankruptcies in chile as one of the few chilean businessmen with low debts and lots of money , mr luksic was able to buy banco de santiago , a leading bank , and the brewery cervecerias unidas sa , or ccu , at rockbottom prices bought for 7 million , ccu eventually became worth more than 1 billion , making it one of the greatest investments in latin american history i never let successes go to my head , because i always knew there would setbacks down the road , said mr luksic in a 1998 interview indeed , the luksic family conglomerate , qui enco , struggled for a time in the late 1990 s as investments in neighboring countries , such as argentina , peru and brazil , were hit by severe economic crises the family s banking interests also were hurt when a rival , banco santander of spain , merged with another spanish bank but none of these setbacks proved fatal , thanks to mr luksic s strategy of diversifying his investments and remaining cashrich until his retirement , mr luksic continued to show up every day at his office in downtown santiago he entrusted his oldest son , also named andr nico , to manage the family s banking interests , while his middle son , guillermo , led the qui enco companies and his youngest son , jeanpaul , ran the mining operations his daughters , paola and mar a gabriela , oversaw the family s charitable foundations besides his children , mr luksic is survived by his second wife , iris fontbona
when you own part of the yes network , as the yankees do , and you introduce a new acquisition , as they did yesterday with randy johnson , look at what can happen an hourlong show , anchored by two yankees announcers , michael kay and suzyn waldman , that used three cameras , including one on the ceiling above the lectern , and had interviews afterward with johnson and the yankees executives brian cashman and randy levine all we needed were reaction shots of george steinbrenner s checkbook the event was preceded and followed by the television simulcast of wfan s mike and the mad dog radio show , bookends of live discussion about johnson s signing and other sports topics this is control , the advantage of having a network whose first initial stands for yankees control is the reason the mets are starting a network in 2006 a metsrun tv channel will be more devoted to team news , like the introduction of a star free agent like carlos beltran it is called propaganda but such devotion was not exhibited by the msg network , which carried the beltran news conference yesterday and splits mets telecasts with fox sports new york the show leading into the news conference was a repeat of the previous night s sportsdesk , which looked ahead to the next morning s event from a 12hoursold perspective our deb kaufman will host the second blockbuster announcement of this interesting offseason at shea , steve cangialosi , the coanchor of the show , said kaufman offered a brief , live introduction from the msg studio , which lacked the immediacy of being at the diamond club at shea the halfhour production \( which appeared to use only one camera \) was probably too little for met fans matt loughlin , msg s reporter , interviewed beltran , but not omar minaya , the team s general manager , or anyone else then it was time to return to sportsdesk , which looked ahead to a news conference that had already happened beltran was less the news conference star than johnson , who has greater career stats and who awakened to headlines like pitching a fit and big jerk for his altercation on monday with a channel 2 cameraman who tried to film him in manhattan notoriety sells , and beltran has none so johnson s news conference was dominated by questions about the incident and how he would handle pressure he apologized often to the news media \( promising them time , but not on his surly days \) , then engaged in stiff repartee with channel 2 s duke castiglione , who had sought an interview with johnson before the incident with the cameraman on madison avenue you seem to forget that when we were leaving the hotel that i said i was going to allocate some time after my physical , johnson said after castiglione introduced himself am i right about that \? no , castiglione replied , you just said , 'not right now ' johnson complained that castiglione s report said that he had refused to talk , not that he had deferred the request for the interview on his first day as a yankees newbie johnson was a beneficiary of yankees stagecraft he stood before a banner with the classic batandtophat yankees logo \( beltran stood in front of one that alternated the mets' name and delta airlines' \) , having been draped in pinstripes before he started speaking , letting viewers watch him wear the longest yankees jersey since steve hamilton s for a full 18 minutes the mets chose a less effective route , having beltran don the mets' home top after he finished taking questions another interesting difference that crystallized on television was the way the team families presented themselves throughout his session , beltran stood side by side with minaya , as if they were outfielders their camera time as a twosome \( 12 minutes 25 seconds \) exceeded the amount of time msg zoomed in on beltran \( 5 58 \) minaya has become the executive face of the mets the wilpon family has moved to the background by contrast , at yankee stadium , after introductory remarks by cashman , levine and rick cerrone , the yankees' publicity chief , johnson stood alone later , when johnson was flanked by kay and waldman , he must have felt a peculiar vibe coming from waldman , the new yankees analyst on wcbs radio she began a question by referring to johnson s winning relief stint for seattle in game 5 of the 1995 divisional playoffs against the yankees if we can go back to that day in 1995 , she said michael and i had one of the worst days of our lives when you came in from the bullpen well , at least she is his fan now

a plan by intelsat , announced yesterday , to purchase panamsat holding for 32 billion is the largest takeover in recent years in the fastconsolidating commercial satellite industry but it is unlikely to be the last there are still about three dozen satellite providers operating worldwide , which means there are too many players in a market that is no longer growing fast enough to sustain them all increasingly , a global network matters , too programmers like disney , cnn and others are expanding into asia , the middle east and beyond and need satellite operators that can beam their signals to all points on the globe panamsat had this in mind last month when it bought a satellite and two orbital slots from alcatel to help it expand further into europe , the middle east , africa and asia then there is the big threat from the operators of the world s transcontinental and transoceanic fiber networks these companies can zip bits and bytes around the world , often for far less than satellite operators to combat these lowcost providers , satellite companies need the size and scale to drive prices lower they also need to focus on their unique ability to offer highspeed data connections , video programming and phone service to developing countries where markets are just opening and where fiber networks are scarce to do that , they need a constellation of satellites that blanket not just wealthy markets in north america , europe and parts of asia , but also africa , the middle east and south america i think this is just a normal step going forward , said joseph r wright jr , the chief executive of panamsat we 're kind of following a normal evolution in our industry consolidation is not only necessary , but inevitable if intelsat s purchase of panamsat is approved , the new company would become the industry leader with 53 satellites , surpassing ses global of luxembourg , which has 35 satellites the only other company with more than 10 satellites is eutelsat , the european operator , which has 23 satellites the remaining companies are far smaller , which makes the likelihood of another large deal doubtful yet many smaller companies could help one of the big operators expand into new regions loral space and communications , which has four satellites across the globe , is likely to be involved in future mergers and acquisitions , according to industry analysts the company expects to come out of bankruptcy around oct 1 and be relisted on the nasdaq stock exchange immediately afterward it will also reemerge with little debt , something bernard l schwartz , the chairman of the company , said could be a big selling or buying point without significant debt on our balance sheet , and having equity , i'm hoping to actively participate in the market , he said intelsat and panamsat will not be out there to expand for quite a while that leaves opportunities for the rest of us new skies satellites of the netherlands is another company that some industry analysts say could become a takeover target the company has five satellites and , like panamsat and intelsat , is owned partly by private equity investors the blackstone group , in this case who want a return on their investment many small , regional operators are governmentowned and are unlikely to be spun off or sold but these companies are good candidates to form joint ventures , industry executives say still , none of the merger talks would be in earnest if demand for satellite services were not on the upswing growth in highdefinition broadcasting , internetbased programming and ondemand video services have buoyed satellite providers in north america , asia and europe the larger satellite providers expect demand for video services to grow as much as 10 percent this year the fundamentals are improving and it s being driven by things like highdefinition televisions , said todd mitchell , an industry analyst at kaufman brothers equity research the programmers are putting these products out there and you need more capacity for that telecommunications companies in developing countries are also expanding their phone and internet services and need ways to transport signals around the globe cheaply and the biggest client of them all , the united states government , is also leasing more satellite space to provide communications to afghanistan , iraq and elsewhere as always , the key to consolidation lies in the hands of regulators but in the united states , satellite companies are likely to face little resistance , industry analysts say the justice department has approved several large deals between wireless and landline companies in recent years , and they are likely to approve most satellite deals , too
washington , may 18 republicans and democrats drew new lines on wednesday in the battle over john r bolton , issuing rival reports to stake out their positions for the next stage of the senate debate over his nomination to become ambassador to the united nations the reports reflected the deep divisions on the foreign relations committee that prevented mr bolton from winning its endorsement last week the panel s republicans , who took the unusual step of voting to send mr bolton s nomination to the senate without a recommendation , submitted only an eightpage brief that described him as a highly qualified nominee who had not sought to manipulate intelligence , despite the claims of his critics the democrats , who were united in opposition to the nomination , used their own 64page report to present a case against mr bolton as someone whose conduct toward subordinates and intelligence analysts should disqualify him for the post the democrats also cited what they described as new evidence that mr bolton , in testimony to the panel , had vastly understated his role in seeking to oust a top central intelligence agency analyst in a dispute over cuba the senate s republican leaders have said they hope to hold a vote on the nomination next week , before the memorial day recess , and the white house and the state department have urged quick action but the timing remains highly uncertain , with the senate seeking first to resolve the bitter dispute over judicial nominees , and democrats calling on the state department to hand over more documents that might shed light on mr bolton s conduct in another dispute , over syria , in 2003 the republican report acknowledged that mr bolton had a reputation for being an aggressive and blunt negotiator but said that should not disqualify him for a post that historically has included a number of blunt , plainspoken individuals , including jeane kirkpatrick and our former colleague pat moynihan in fact , president bush has cited john bolton s direct style as one of the reasons that he has picked him for this particular job , the republican report said it said the committee s investigation had found no evidence to support the most serious charge that mr bolton had sought to manipulate intelligence he may have disagreed with intelligence findings , the report said , but in the end he always accepted the final judgment of the intelligence community the democrats portrayed mr bolton as someone who bullied others and sought to use his power to shape intelligence reports to reflect his policy views their report called new attention to his role in the dispute with the cia analyst , fulton armstrong , who was the national intelligence officer for latin america mr bolton testified last month that he had sought to have mr armstrong transferred , but said his effort had been limited to one part of one conversation with one person one time , in july 2002 with mr armstrong s supervisor , stuart cohen but the report cites previously undisclosed internal email messages suggesting that mr bolton s efforts began before the conversation with mr cohen and did not end until four months later none of the new email messages cited appear to have been sent by mr bolton , but they include at least five messages sent by aides to mr bolton and a state department ally , otto reich , which the democrats cited as evidence that the two offices actively discussed their joint effort to seek the removal of mr armstrong from his post one message circulated by a bolton aide on june 7 , 2002 , contains a still classified draft letter from mr bolton and mr reich that is addressed to george j tenet , then the director of central intelligence the draft urged the immediate replacement of mr armstrong and indicated that mr bolton and mr reich would take several measures on their own , including excluding mr armstrong from official meetings at the state department and official travel in the western hemisphere , the democratic report says it cites a reply by a state department official who reported that he had discussed the matter with mr bolton , and said that mr bolton would prefer at this point to handle this in person with tenet all eight democrats on the panel voted against sending mr bolton s nomination to the full senate the republicans , with 10 votes , hold the majority on the panel , but could agree only to let the senate work its will , as one of them , senator george v voinovich of ohio , put it in breaking ranks with the party to oppose the nomination
town leaders in preston are expected to begin negotiations soon on the final land and development deals with utopia studios of new york , the investment firm proposing a 16 billion entertainment complex for the former norwich state hospital property utopia studios promises to create 22 , 000 jobs and 150 million in annual state taxes and , at 52 million total square feet , the complex will be larger than the neighboring foxwoods resort casino and slightly smaller than mohegan sun casino the complex will feature movie and television studios , a performing arts college , four theme parks , an entertainment and retail plaza , and waterfront hotels with up to 4 , 200 rooms on march 22 , the project received a big boost when voters in a referendum approved a memorandum of understanding between the town and utopia by a 6to1 margin the memorandum , which called for a negotiation deadline of no later than july 22 , outlines the terms of the final development deal members of the town s norwich hospital advisory committee , which negotiated the memorandum , said they were pleasantly surprised that utopia conceded so much to the town the agreement calls for utopia to bond the cleanup cost an expense estimated at 25 million to 40 million and put 4 million in escrow at closing utopia s project would generate at least 10 million in annual revenue to the town , including 7 million in development fees , but not including taxes utopia would have four years to complete the project and would face penalties for defaulting after the twoyear mark the memorandum will require approval at another referendum before preston can profit from utopia , it first has to buy 419 acres from the state in september , the state offered the hospital property to the host municipalities of norwich and preston for 1 each with the condition that the municipalities assume responsibility for the cleanup last monday , norwich leaders said the time was right for the city to accept the state s offer the city has not actively sought developers for the site preston , meanwhile , reviewed a copy of a state environmental report of the site last sunday that showed asbestos and lead paint in the 60 buildings on its portion of the land and pesticide in the ground immediately surrounding the buildings there were also isolated environmental concerns , including oil and chemical leakage near a building that housed a drycleaning operation but none of the problems were deemed significant and could easily be addressed , said robert congdon , preston s first selectman mr congdon and the advisory committee spent nearly a month in negotiations with the office of gov m jodi rell before settling on the terms of the property transfer before both parties sign the final agreement , the state must act on a petition asking whether an environmental assessment of the undeveloped portion of the land is required before the transfer utopia studios , led by joseph gentile and his wife , cathy moriartygentile , remains active in its bid to build the largest development in eastern connecticut s history the company recently hired james sullivan of norwich , a former congressional candidate , as a fulltime consultant he will lobby for utopia and help the development team with its plans for norwich and other parts of the region outside of preston money follows good ideas , mr sullivan said i am extremely confident that this proposal is well on its way to fruition photo the proposed site for a 16 billion entertainment complex \( photo by mj fiedler for the new york times \)
jersey city diners of a certain age , says a note on porto leggero s firstrate web site , will surely need to be reminded that this is jersey city there s an understatement this 110seat restaurant inhabits a soaring , woodbeamed atrium on the ground floor of the 34story harborside plaza 5 , one of many steelandglass office towers built atop the wreckage of the brawny shippingandwarehouse industry that flourished on jersey city s docks in first half of the 20th century seated in its lushly padded lounge or on one of its tall banquettes , eating bountiful portions of highend italian food , you have to strain for any sense of place at all not that the sensation is unpleasant far from it it s just incongruous especially at night , when the harborside complex is nearly deserted through the restaurant s spectacular floortoceiling windows you look out on still more office towers , their lighted windows staring blankly back at you every 10 minutes or so the retromodern trolleys of the hudsonbergen light rail line glide by between all that and the restaurant s highconcept d cor \( exposed bricks , iron scrollwork , ranks of chandeliers , a mirrored bar that resembles a huge stainedglass window \) , the net effect is almost surreal medieval times meets maurice sendak s in the night kitchen the guiding genius here is none other than michael cetrulo , the ruler of a small restaurant empire whose crown jewel is the revered scalini fedeli in chatham for porto leggero s debut , last summer , mr cetrulo imported scalini s veteran souschef , angelo stella they have created a foursquare , masculine bill of fare that needs to be executed a bit more consistently to be worthy of its surroundings and its financialdistrict prices some of those prices are found not on the regular menu but on a list of specials that require prodigious feats of memory by diners and servers alike on one of our visits , a monster veal chop topped the charts at 3895 like all the meats here , this one came from the reliable j vrola inc in south amboy , and it had flavor to match its heft the accompanying mashed potatoes were alluringly dosed with truffle oil , and the whole production would have been perfect if not for a slight excess of oil in the winy brown sauce the regular menu is evenly divided between traditional and signature dishes , matched on facing pages each main ingredient pastas , lamb , red snapper and so on can thus be prepared in either of two formats , at identical prices , with the signature dishes a little less standard but still very much in the mainstream the signature lamb , for instance , is a rich , slowroasted shank with a chewy saffron risotto the traditional counterpart , which we did n't try , is marinated lamb chops over saut ed mushrooms the meal starts off generously , with an appetizersize giveaway bruschetta that delivers a powerful jolt composed of olive , onion , tomato and vinegar and the appetizers continue in this energetic vein portobello mushrooms , chopped and saut ed , with a great heap of flawless arugula and thick shavings of parmesan , all bound by a vibrant freshthyme vinaigrette diver scallops over white beans in a plumtomato sauce fragrant with rosemary slightly bland buffalo mozzarella , redeemed by its capresestyle topping of roasted red peppers and sweetsour tomatoes the rich flavors in a special appetizer incorporating saut ed shrimps and a small , tender lobster tail were nicely offset by the tang of white wine most of the main courses delivered at similarly high levels , making the

at 12 05 am yesterday , moments into the earliest store opening on the busiest shopping day of the year , the beleaguered employees at the compusa on 57th street in manhattan laid down some ground

, speculating that higher gas and home heating prices , combined with the upheaval wrought by the three hurricanes that swept through the gulf coast and florida , would pinch consumer budgets on what has become the biggest shopping day of the year \( a title held , until 2003 , by the saturday before christmas , according to shoppertrak , a market research firm \) so to ensure a respectable season

to the editor we take issue with your statement in our terroristfriendly borders \( editorial , an insecure nation series , march 21 \) that suspected terrorists have long been entering the country from canada you suggest that none of the sept 11 hijackers entered the united states through canada and in fact , none did , as was acknowledged in late 2001 by attorney general john ashcroft , who has also referred to help of canadian authorities in the apprehension of the millennium bomber ahmed ressam in 1999 since then , our two countries have implemented a smart border action plan as well as national security policies , including almost 10 billion in security investments and the creation of a department similar to the department of homeland security , that help keep north america closed to terrorists and open for business earlier this month , michael chertoff , the new secretary of homeland security , visited canada and stated that together we are keeping terrorists out in open societies such as ours , we all know that no security arrangement can be 100 percent effective but between canada and the united states , the record is clear our cooperation has reduced the threat of terrorism in both our countries frank mckenna ambassador of canada washington , march 21 , 2005

jackson , miss , nov 15 the federal emergency management agency moved tuesday to nudge victims of hurricane katrina toward selfsufficiency , announcing that it would cut off financing for most of the 60 , 000 families in governmentpaid hotel and motel rooms by the end of this month the deadline , three months after the hurricane struck , will bring the agency s assistance packages more into line with the customary array of federal disaster aid there are still too many people living in hotel rooms , and we want to help them get into longerterm homes before the holidays , the agency s acting director , r david paulison , said in a statement across the country , there are readily available , longerterm housing solutions for these victims that can give greater privacy and stability than hotel and motel rooms the cutoff will come in two phases in the first , payments for hotel rooms occupied by about 50 , 000 of the families will end on dec 1 in the second , an apartment shortage in louisiana and mississippi has led the agency to give the 12 , 000 families living in hotels in those two states until jan 7 to move out , or assume the cost on their own assuming that their permanent homes still cannot be occupied , fema will offer people in both of those groups temporaryhousing rental assistance worth an average of 786 a month that is less than half what hotels have been costing the government in a typical month nicol andrews , a fema spokeswoman , said the agency s caseworkers , as well as charities that it is helping to finance , would assist these families in the search for housing we are just trying to help people move on , ms andrews said but representative barney frank of massachusetts , the ranking democrat on a house panel that oversees housing issues related to the hurricane , said fema was not giving the families enough warning two weeks' notice is outrageous , mr frank said these are not people who can easily find alternative accommodations the agency has also notified state and local governments that it plans to end financing on march 1 for a program , set up in about two dozen cities , through which apartments have been rented on behalf of storm victims houston alone has issued 39 , 500 vouchers for evacuee families , costing the federal government more than 100 million the goal of this program was to speed the move from shelters or motels into more stable housing but fema wants to get out of the business of directly financing the rental of apartments the agency has told state and local governments that as of this week , they can no longer sign leases of more than three months as of dec 1 , they will no longer be able to sign any new leases and finally , as of march 1 the government is to stop paying for all outstanding leases , although fema officials said tuesday that state and municipal authorities would be permitted to apply for extensions it remains unclear what will happen in cities like houston , where officials have signed many yearlong leases for evacuees from the storm none of this prevents victims from using direct aid from fema the 786 a month on average to rent apartments or assume control of leases that the state or local government has initially rented on their behalf housing aid for these families will last up to 18 months a total of 12 billion in such aid has been given to more than 500 , 000 families so far
fort bliss , tex , aug 4 in a small courtroom at this vast army training base , military prosecutors have been moving briskly to dispense with the cases they have filed in the brutal deaths in 2002 of two afghan prisoners at the american military detention center in bagram , afghanistan on thursday , a 24yearold military intelligence sergeant pleaded guilty to assault and dereliction of duty for abusing one of the prisoners during an interrogation another interrogator , accused of tormenting the same detainee , agreed to plead guilty two days before military lawyers said that a plea deal was being negotiated with a third interrogator and that two reservist military policemen who received lesser punishments were cooperating with the inquiry military officials said they hoped the prosecutions would send a message that such abuses will not be tolerated , even in the country s fight against terrorism but whatever their longterm implications , the cases have so far tended to illustrate how unprepared many soldiers were for their duties at bagram , how loosely some were supervised and how vaguely the rules under which they operated were often defined along with other information that has emerged , trial testimony has underscored a question long at the core of this case what is the responsibility of more senior military personnel for the abuses that took place \? many former bagram officers have denied knowing about any serious mistreatment of detainees before the two deaths but others said some of the methods that prosecutors have cited as a basis for criminal charges , including chaining prisoners to the ceilings of isolation cells for long periods , were either standard practice at the prison or wellknown to those who oversaw it none of the nine soldiers prosecuted thus far are officers the 18 others against whom army investigators have recommended criminal charges include two captains , the military intelligence officer in charge of the interrogation group and the reservist commander of the military police guards in the first interview granted by any of the accused soldiers , a former guard charged with maiming and assault said that he and other reservist military policemen were specifically instructed at bagram how to deliver the type of blows that killed the two detainees , and that the strikes were commonly used when prisoners resisted being hooded or shackled i just do n't understand how , if we were given training to do this , you can say that we were wrong and should have known better , said the soldier , pvt willie v brand , 26 , of cincinnati , a father of four who volunteered for tours in afghanistan and kosovo in interviews and statements to investigators , soldiers who served at bagram have at times echoed the defenses offered unsuccessfully by the soldiers charged with abuses at the abu ghraib prison in iraq , saying they were acting on instructions from military intelligence personnel or on the authority of superior officers but documents from the bagram investigation and interviews with military officials suggest that at least some soldiers implicated in the two deaths may be able to make such arguments more forcefully than their counterparts from abu ghraib , who were unable to prove any authorization for their actions witness statements and interviews , for example , indicate that there was a longrunning conflict at bagram between military intelligence and military police units over the interrogators' use of guards to keep awake detainees whom they wanted disoriented for questioning the statements are among nearly 2 , 000 pages of documents from the criminal investigation that the army began after the two men , a brother of a reputed taliban commander and a young taxi driver , died six days apart in december 2002 the new york times obtained a copy of the case file from a person involved in the inquiry who was critical of the military s response to the abuses last october , a final report by the criminal investigation command of the army recommended charges against 27 soldiers and officers it said both deaths were primarily caused by severe trauma to the men s legs , which led to a blood clot and a pulmonary embolism in one and heart failure in the other the report added that sleep deprivation at the direction of military intelligence soldiers was also a direct contributing factor in the death of the taxi driver private brand , the guard who has faced the most serious charges , was perhaps the most open and selfincriminating in his sworn statements to investigators in three interviews , he said he repeatedly struck the two shackled detainees above the knee with blows intended to incapacitate the leg by hitting the common peroneal nerve private brand said he struck the first detainee who died , mullah habibullah , about four times so he could force a hood over his head he said he struck the taxi driver , a slight 22yearold known only as dilawar , somewhere in the area of 37 times , less than 40 for sure , after becoming frustrated with his recalcitrance in a court hearing in march , one prosecutor noted that private brand also told investigators that the guards were also instructed to use the knee strikes for selfdefense and not for mere resistance but in an interview at fort bliss , where he is awaiting trial later this month , private brand insisted that the knee strikes were taught at bagram as a basic way to gain the compliance of prisoners other soldiers have said the blows were also part of training overseen by sergeants in the reserve unit , the 377th military police battalion , before it deployed overseas private brand said that when his platoon took over the night shift at the detention center , he was told that prisoners would often resist when military intelligence soldiers ordered hoods pulled over their heads so you just give them a common peroneal strike and yank it down and be on your merry way , he said it just seemed like the way to control people private brand , a security guard who dreamed of joining the regular army , had more experience than many of his fellow reservists one of his former sergeants testified that he had been regarded as a model soldier in recommending the dismissal of an involuntary manslaughter charge that army prosecutors initially sought against private brand , the investigating officer who oversaw his pretrial inquiry , col stephen b pence , wrote that there was no evidence that the accused knew or should have known that the knee strikes could mortally injure a detainee , or that the blows would be anything other than temporarily disabling a lawyer for another military policeman who has been charged , specialist anthony m morden , said in a pretrial hearing that witnesses he hoped to call would testify that the guards were specifically authorized to use force to gain compliance the lawyer for one of the former military intelligence soldiers , sgt selena m salcedo , pointed to her lack of preparation as she entered a guilty plea , saying she had no prior training in interrogations and learned that she would be questioning prisoners only after arriving in afghanistan sergeant salcedo , 24 , said she became frustrated with mr dilawar when he refused to look at her during an interrogation , a problem she said she faced as a woman dealing with afghan and arab detainees she admitted kicking mr dilawar in the knees and thighs , grabbing him by the ears when he looked away , and pulling him up repeatedly when he was unable to hold stress positions against a wall because of his injuries she knew that she did n't have the training or experience as an interrogator , said her lawyer , capt mario j derossi she never once said , 'i ca n't do it ' the judge in the case , lt col mark p sposato , appeared to be persuaded by those arguments , along with testimony that sergeant salcedo , too , had otherwise been a model soldier , finishing first in her training class , volunteering for duty in iraq and being recommended for several awards he brushed aside the prosecution s request that she be imprisoned for eight months and dishonorably discharged , and sentenced her instead to a onegrade demotion , a written reprimand and a 1 , 000 fine but like colonel pence , colonel sposato has thus far entertained few questions about the wider responsibility for abuses at bagram , denying requests by private brand s lawyers to call a string of witnesses who they said could shed light on the orders and training the guards received the senior military intelligence official at bagram , brig gen theodore c nicholas ii , who was then a colonel , told investigators last year that the interrogators were restricted to methods codified long before the sept 11 attacks in army field manual 3452 general nicholas said he did not recall detainees being shackled with their arms overhead to deprive them of sleep , as other officers said was commonly done general nicholas said he once saw shackles dangling from the metal bars above a holding cell but was told they were reserved for the temporary punishment of combative detainees i recall saying they better ensure the individual s feet could touch the floor , he told the investigators last year an intelligence officer beneath general nicholas who dealt more directly with the interrogation group , lt col ronald r stallings , told investigators that he , too , had no idea that prisoners were being chained overhead for more than 24 hours at a time but lt col john w loffert jr , who took over as the intelligence operations officer shortly before the deaths , said he saw the practice being used as soon as he arrived at the detention center i know they were forced to stand , handcuffed to chains that extended from the ceiling , colonel loffert told investigators their hands were approximately chestlevel it was plainly visible and discussed as a technique during an inquiry ordered by the american military commander at bagram after the deaths in their final report , the investigators recommended that prosecutors charge the junior officer who led the interrogation group , capt carolyn a wood , with dereliction of duty , saying she was clearly informed the techniques documented within fm 3452 were the only approved interrogation techniques to be used at bagram but in a statement given in the commander s inquiry , captain wood asked for additional legal guidance about techniques like stress positions and sleep deprivation in interviews , other former interrogators said she and the staff sergeant who was her deputy had for months been seeking clarification from their superiors about the interrogation methods they could use they asked many , many times , said one former bagram interrogator who agreed to speak only on condition of anonymity because of the continuing investigation the lack of guidance was a source of frustration for them my own feeling is that it was never given because nobody wanted to put themselves on the line
with great fanfare , fidelity investments announced recently that it would revolutionize how it paid wall street for research and trading by separating the cost of research from the cost of trading traditionally , trading and research costs have been tied together , making regulators and some fund directors nervous because it is not clear what exactly is included in an allincluded price because it was fidelity the mutual fund behemoth that pays about 1 billion in commissions to the street that announced the deal , it was assumed that such a deal would be trendsetting and industryrattling it has not been and it probably will not be for a long time in october , fidelity acknowledged that it had brokered a deal with lehman brothers to separate the cost of trading and the cost of research , with the latter cost to be borne by fidelity previously , shareholders of its funds paid for research through the bundled commissions higher commissions that included all sorts of goodies analysts' reports suggest fidelity will pay 7 million for research and 2 to 25 cents for every share of stock traded \( none of the parties are commenting on the economics \) this week , deutsche bank announced that it was entering a similar deal with fidelity according to wall street rumors , two more deals are in the pipeline sounds like a quiet stampede but the deals are all with fidelity , the onetrillionpound gorilla that can afford such a deal because of the amount of trading fidelity does and the huge amount of commissions it pays , fidelity subsidizes smaller players by paying for everything from technology to research fidelity apparently wanted to stop that others are unlikely to follow for a simple reason most mutual fund and hedge fund managements want to make more money , not less , meaning the demand to have them bear the costs of research will be underwhelming there are other compelling reasons the financial services business would like to avoid unbundling wall street does not exactly strive for transparency also , the street has long held that it cannot price research never mind that wall street can price the effects of weather in jakarta , it does not seem able to price one of its primary products regulators do not want to require full unbundling for fear of hurting the smaller funds and hedge funds wall street s favorite clients , along with private equity funds pay rich commissions to stay in the information flow , a symbiosis neither wants to upset so can the genie of unbundling be put back in the bottle \? not quite many mutual fund managers are preparing to unbundle internally they will account for what part of the commission goes to trading and what goes to research , and they will show their directors that breakdown mutual fund board members may eventually take note that it is their fiduciary responsibility to act on behalf of fund shareholders , who would probably prefer that the fund management company , with all those high fees , should pay for research and wall street , noticing these unusually alert board members , will respond they will determine a cost for research that will hopefully show that research has value by valuing it , mutual funds will be far more selective in what they get and research will improve or disappear the cost of trading which varies from about half a cent to 5 cents to execute the sale of one share of stock will also become more transparent wall street could be in for a surprise on another front it is possible that unbundling will lead to more volume , which in an age of electronic trading , means more money if a 50 billion mutual fund gets research from 50 firms , it has to pay for that research by trading with those 50 firms if it pays for research with cash , it will trade with a smaller number of firms who are better positioned to get the fund the best deal so there are arguments for unbundling but they will not carry the day until fidelity is not alone until someone else steps up , every mutual fund company can look at fidelity and make excuses , citing fidelity s size it will be the next to bat that could release the floodgates so , who s up \?
the state of new jersey has offered 10 million to settle a lawsuit filed on behalf of three children who were starved by their adoptive parents , a spokesman for the department of human services said yesterday it would be the largest settlement in the history of the department of youth and family services , said the spokesman , andy williams the revelation came as a federal judge ruled that three of the children had the right to sue the state for damages , a move the state had fought in court the case involves keith jackson , 15 tyrone jackson , 11 and michael jackson , 11 , the three minor sons of vanessa and raymond jackson of collingswood mr and mrs jackson were arrested in october 2003 and charged with child endangerment and aggravated assault after a neighbor found their 19yearold son , bruce , rummaging through the garbage for food none of the boys weighed more than 45 pounds when they were removed from the jackson home raymond jackson died in november , and his wife is awaiting trial we have made an offer that would provide in excess of 10 million to the kids , structured in a way to ensure that most of the money goes toward the kids' needs , minimizing the amount going to lawyers' fees , mr williams said he said the offer was made last month and would cover all four sons we do n't want to give up any responsibility here , mr williams said we are committed to settling the lawsuit that has n't changed in rejecting the state s efforts to have the children s lawsuit dismissed , judge stanley s brotman of federal district court wrote that the possibility of civil damages serves as the most effective enforcement mechanism for the child placement bill of rights act , which granted children placed outside their homes the rights to adequate food , shelter and medical care and to a reasonably safe environment marcia robinson lowry , executive director of children s rights , a nonprofit advocacy group , and the minor children s legal guardian , said that she would not comment on any settlement offer , but she said the judge s decision strengthened the children s position regarding any future settlement after the decision today , it may be a whole new ballgame , she said my legal position is onehundredfold stronger today than it was yesterday bruce jackson s lawyer , michael critchley , did not immediately respond to a phone message last evening a report last year by kevin m ryan , the state s child advocate , found that child welfare workers had failed to make the most basic checks on the jackson children over a dozen years in a statement yesterday , mr ryan said he disagreed strongly with the state s motion to dismiss the suit the boys deserved better from us than a court fight , he said that is shameful if there is any justice in the world , this case should settle in favor of the boys quickly and finally
in that pretzel twist of a thriller memento there s an irresistible scene in which the amnesiac hero played by guy pearce runs at breakneck speed first , the amnesiac wonders what he is doing and then he decides he s chasing another man , only to realize just before the other guy squeezes off a round in his direction that he is being chased in turn in the rather less twisty , if nicely kinked belgian thriller the memory of a killer , the title character faces his own dangerous adversary , except that here the enemy hot on his heels is dementia originally titled the alzheimer case , this mnemonically minded film opens as two separate stories one involving an idealistic young cop , the other an older hardbitten assassin that clue by clue , break by break , eventually twist together directed by erik van looy and adapted by carl joos and mr looy from a novel by jef geeraerts , the story takes place in 1995 , in antwerp , beginning with a showdown between the cop , eric \( koen de bouw \) , and a pimp selling his daughter for sex child prostitution is only one part of a puzzle that encompasses a range of good guys and bad , including the hit man , angelo ledda \( jan decleir \) , whose sense of morality and world weariness seem straight out of a jeanpierre melville film soon after ledda signs on for a job in marseille , he travels to belgium to fulfill his contract and extinguish two people stirring up trouble for a government power broker fluent in french , flemish and dangerous weaponry , partial to hard drinks and pliant women , ledda registers as a thoroughly oldschool villain with eyes like slits and a body as thick and hard as a punching bag , he is as formidable a presence as the actor playing him from certain angles mr decleir , who has been kept busy by the belgian film industry for decades , looks like bruno ganz s tougher older brother \( mr decleir is actually a few years younger \) more important to the dirty business at hand , he imparts to ledda , like melville s bob le flambeur , a fine hoodlum face after ledda completes the first half of his contract , dispatching a government official who seems like a good family man , he moves onto the second yet when he realizes who the next target is ledda recoils and refuses to finish the job unsympathetic to his moral qualms , his employers respond as might be expected and turn their lethal sights on him the hunter becomes the hunted , not only for the cops who are slowly picking up his scent , but also for a confederacy of perverts , murderers and bureaucrats all these create headaches for ledda , but none has the lethal , stubborn force of the disease wiping away his memory , thoughts and very identity i can hear your blood flowing , a woman says one night as she rests against him it s my head emptying , he answers ledda s dilemma and mr decleir s exceptionally fine performance give the memory of a killer its twinned points of interest the rest of the cast , in particular mr de bouw and werner de smedt , as his hotheaded colleague , freddy , hold their own , but the cops are generally familiar , stock players from television procedurals and lack the psychological complexity that makes ledda so intriguing an amnesiac killer is an inherently rich conceit , and it s no surprise that an american movie company has already snapped up remake rights still , without mr decleir and the director s careful attention to character and detail , not just guns and ammunition , the conceit could feel like a gimmick instead , here is a thriller that asks , are men essentially good or do they just sometimes forget to be bad \? the memory of a killer is rated r \( under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian \) the film contains gun violence , a deadly explosion , adult language and themes , and female nudity the memory of a killer opens today in manhattan directed by erik van looy written \( in flemish and french , with english subtitles \) by carl joos and mr van looy , based on the novel the alzheimer case by jef geeraerts director of photography , danny elsen edited by philippe ravoet music by stephen warbeck art director , johan van assche produced by erwin provoost and hilde de laere released by sony pictures classics running time 120 minutes this film is rated r with koen de bouw \( eric vincke \) , werner de smedt \( freddy verstuyft \) , jan decleir \( angelo ledda \) , hilde de baerdemaeker \( linda de leenheer \) , geert van rampelberg \( tom coemans \) , jo de meyere \( baron henri gustave de haeck \) and patrick descamps \( gilles resnais \)
taipei , taiwan , tuesday , may 3 taking a chapter from chineseamerican diplomacy during the nixon administration , china announced tuesday that it would give a pair of giant pandas to taiwan , the latest step in an evolving d tente in gestures to mark the end of the weeklong visit to china by lien chan , chairman of taiwan s opposition nationalist party , chinese officials also said they would increase imports of taiwanese fruit and allow more chinese to visit taiwan the moves , announced by the official new china news agency , are clearly intended to appeal to public sentiment here and force president chen shuibian to improve ties many here have been pining for pandas taiwan has none now and local media have been engaged in sometimes frenzied speculation that taiwan s chance might have finally arrived the chinese willingness to import more fruit is a direct appeal for moderation from some of the strongest advocates of taiwanese independence , the farmers of southern taiwan they are also a cornerstone of the political base of president chen , who grew up in a farming village there the chinese decision to liberalize tourism could , if permitted by taiwan , make the island s travel industry almost as dependent on the mainland as hong kong s , and turn hoteliers and restaurateurs into advocates of closer relations with beijing president chen and his democratic progressive party have risen to power by confronting china , emphasizing a separate taiwanese identity and flirting with independence but mr lien s visit , the first by a nationalist leader since the end of china s civil war in 1949 , has put pressure on president chen to show he can also work with china s leaders the pressure is especially acute because elections will be held on may 14 for the national assembly , an obscure body that has a role only in constitutional decisions and is separate from the legislature the elections will be an indication of public sentiment , and president chen wants to push through constitutional changes during his three remaining years in office
where are the natives the nativest \? that question , in not quite that form , has been on my mind ever since i got to southern california in midjanuary it s easy enough to find examples of all the familiar stereotypes here , if only because attitudes , like automobiles , do not rust in this climate but what i 've been looking for is the place where southern californians seem most instinctively at home is it doheny beach , where a young girl skims and swirls in a pool of saltwater left behind by the tide \? is it the courtyard of the norton simon museum , where an elderly couple sits watching the water irises \? is it the drivethrough line at the innout , where a pair of cops in their cruiser feel as burgerish as the rest of us \? the answer , i 've decided , is the carwash , especially on a sunday afternoon but saying the carwash in southern california is a little like saying the pub in england it raises important questions of class , identity and belonging you can , of course , find carwashes here that resemble those in the rest of the country quarterfed doityourself highpressurespray washes but what i mean is the 100 percent handwash joint on the corner , the one with a line backing onto the street on weekends for weeks , i drove past our local carwash without turning in , certain , as only a new yorker can be , that i would be ignorant of some secret protocol and make a fool of myself but the secret of southern california is that , except in a few circles , there are no secret protocols the only trick question the attendant asked me when i turned my car over to him was what kind of air freshener i wanted the answer , of course , was none he handed me a ticket to take to the cashier , and a team of men armed with vacuum hoses fell upon my vehicle this moment of surrender is a more powerful version of what happens when you give your car over to valet parking in , say , brentwood or santa monica i think , in fact , that it may be one of the most profound psychological moments in a southern californian s week a car is many mythic kinds of creature in this automad part of the world , but it is also a burden , a load that is very hard to lay down to drive into a carwash and surrender your car is an almost celestial release it is the mechanical form of an outofbody experience you are with your car and without it at my carwash this is how i think of it now the real point is to accentuate that feeling , while scrubbing the freeway grime off the side panels and brushing the painted ladies , a suddenly plenteous butterfly , off the grille i stand at the long viewing window , waiting for my car to come around the corner and onto the track that guides it through the wash a few people sit in booths , eating burritos or hot dogs from the carwash cafe , while they watch their cars go past two men scrub the windshield with longhandled brushes another team soaps down the tires and rocker panels then comes a rinse , and the wax spray begins it looks as if the cars are being frosted in birthday cake colors , green and pink and blue the walls near the front of the carwash are crowded with small automotive adornments for sale steering wheel covers and licenseplate frames and , unaccountably , an enormous selection of greeting cards here , too , is the cashier and a door leading out to a tented terrace with benches and tables and chairs nearly everyone who comes to the carwash knows that timing is everything you watch your car go down the automated interior washandspray track for a minute or two then you pay your bill and take a seat outside on a sunday afternoon , the terrace is crowded one man reads the new york times a pair of young women in white dresses look as if they 've come to the carwash directly from church most people simply spend the time watching the work at hand no one looks impatient it s a beautiful day the mountains gleam in the distance , and a ceramic fountain a peasant boy and girl flirting near a well gurgles nearby soon a man drives my car out of the building and over to the men who will finish the job by hand he drives with the driver s door open his left foot hangs outside the car it looks like a matter of convenience , but it s really another way of signifying the special state of being my car is in the casualness that dangling left foot is a way of saying that my car has never belonged as wholly to me as it does to him at this moment this , too , is somehow gratifying in the lot , perhaps two dozen cars are being spritzed and handrubbed by some two dozen men an arm goes up out there in the lot a red rag twirls in the air my car is ready
he saw seabirds , after seeing none for days , then a blue irregular outline , which became an island with streams spilling into a bay with a great commotion , canoes appeared , then women , sparkling with savage vivacity , swam out from shore herman melville , or rather the protagonist of his polynesian roman clef , typee , had arrived at the marquesas islands even by pacific standards , the marquesas are remote , thousands of miles from south america and 800 miles from tahiti if you were seeking the middle of nowhere , you might land here that s probably how things looked to the 16thcentury spanish explorers who first came across the 12island archipelago and quickly moved on , leaving only a name behind two centuries later , capt james cook dropped anchor long enough for the artist william hodges to sketch some of the inhabitants in 1842 melville , fed up with whaling , jumped ship and stayed a month in 1900 paul gauguin , sociopathic and syphilitic , traveled to the marquesas from tahiti , built a house and settled down to him , the middle of nowhere was home , and he died there in 1903 it was also home , of course , to the indigenous artists who produced most of the 78 objects in adorning the world art of the marquesas islands at the metropolitan museum of art and while this may be the first art museum show devoted to such material , some of it seems oddly familiar the first thing you see in the installation , set in the michael c rockefeller wing , is a threefoothigh wooden figure with a flat outsized head , big circular eyes and an eartoear slash of a mouth called a tiki , it was meant to embody a deity or deified ancestor , though for some viewers it may evoke less exalted associations namely , trader vic s a cartoon rendition of this sculptural type was popularized by the polynesian craze that swept the united states in the 1950 s and 60 s but such references soon drop away at the met with its crouched , asexual body and features in delicate low relief , the tiki is a potent presence , and it keeps recurring in an effigy painted on bark cloth stretched over wood , in a squat devotional statue carved from volcanic stone , in tiny figures bristling from decorative earplugs of ivory and human bone flattened into a lethallooking wedge , the head turns up as the crowning element in marquesan war clubs and still further abstracted , its features circle the handles of ceremonial fans and spread over the incised surfaces of coconutshell bowls the most sensational display of this image , however , was found in the ephemeral medium of body tattooing the marquesans were known throughout polynesia for their extensive and sophisticated practice of this art , though historical evidence of their skill exists largely in western images one of the earliest is a red chalk drawing attributed to hodges , artist in residence on cook s second pacific tour done from life around 1774 on the island of tahuata , called santa christina at the time , it is a portrait of a local chief wearing ornamental finery , including a feathered headdress and an openwork turtleshell medallion , magnificent examples of which are in the show in addition , the sitter s face is covered with tattoos , though hodges has drawn them in a curious way rather than being imprinted on skin , their patterns seem to float off and above the face , and extend beyond it , like a wispy net or veil the result suggests some tentativeness on hodges s part , as if he was n't quite sure what he was seeing , but it produces a sense of flickering , dematerializing movement that tattoos may actually have been meant to convey other such documentary images follow they range from gawky but scrupulously observed watercolors by clarissa chapman armstrong , an american missionary , which show tattoos on men and women , to wilhelm gottlieb tilesius von tilenau s 1813 engraving of a nearly nude warrior in a pictorial bodysuit of extravagant tracery and a slightly later etching by john shillibeer demonstrates that the process of applying tattoos was an end in itself when every inch of flesh had been covered , new designs were added to existing ones , until the skin turned black with overlays so cosmetic vanity alone was not the issue like much art created outside the modern western context , with its nonsensical separation of art from craft , tattooing belonged to an aesthetics of function it was , you might say , usefully fabulous it could serve as a graphic marker of social status wealth and time , and lots of both , went into having a fullbody workup , though a truly supreme position in the hierarchy might be indicated by the complete absence of tattoos , as if to say , i'm above all that tattooing had political implications withstanding the physical pain of an extensive job required the fortitude of a warrior and the proof of bravery would be right there for all to see , an important factor in determining power relationships at home and on the battlefield then there was an erotic dimension melville , riveted and disapproving , scampers around this which is one reason so many missionaries found the practice abhorrent another reason may be that tattoos carried religious meaning they enhanced and protected the spiritual energy of the wearer and simultaneously they contained and controlled that energy , which , like radiation , could be harmful to others if unchecked or misdirected at death , for the soul to pass into the afterlife , the containment of energy had to be relaxed marking replaced by erasing as part of certain mortuary rituals , according to the cultural historian nicholas thomas , the skin of the deceased was slowly rubbed off of the body , tattoos disappearing with it western contact not only curtailed such traditions , but brought even more farreaching changes a marquesan population that may have numbered about 50 , 000 in the early 19th century was reduced to a few thousand by the beginning of the 20th because of emigration and diseases introduced by europeans typee , written halfway between , remains valuable as a record , however fancifully embellished , of marquesan life already under severe stress and as an ethnographic study of the western culture that transformed it that transformation , though drastic , was neither total nor permanent the catalog , written by the exhibition s curator , eric kjellgren , associate curator for oceanic art at the met , and carol s ivory , professor of fine arts at washington state university , mentions marquesan art traditions that continue , unbroken or revived , into the present , carving and tattooing among them no contemporary work appears in the exhibition , which is , to quote the subtitle of typee , a peep at polynesian life , rather than an indepth look what is there , though , adds up to more than an irregular outline of marquesan art instead , it is a wellthoughtout model of how that art operated , and continues to not as an array of competitively valued artifacts , but as a fabric of images and ideas , at once practical and ornamental , uniting a culture in a network of beauty that may change over time , but is there for life adorning the world art of the marquesas islands remains at the metropolitan museum of art , fifth avenue and 82nd street , \( 212 \) 5357710 , through jan 15
in the first months of 2005 , two of electronic dance music s biggest bands will release what are generally referred to as longawaited albums but what s uncertain is how many people are actually waiting to greet the chemical brothers' push the button , out this week , or daft punk s human after all , due in march if the humiliatingly lukewarm response to last fall s comeback albums by the top dance acts the prodigy and fatboy slim is any measure , neither daft punk nor the chemical brothers ought to bank on teeming throngs at the record stores or a warm radio welcome during the halcyon days of the late 90 s , these groups were the big four of crossover electronica , their music fusing techno s pounding machine rhythms with anthemic hooks and hard riffs that worked as well on rock radio as they did on the dance floor the prodigy s success eclipsed everybody else s \( the fat of the land sold nearly three million copies in america alone \) , but daft punk and chemical brothers enjoyed mtv hits \( da funk and setting sun , respectively \) , while tracks by fatboy slim achieved ubiquity via movie soundtracks and tv commercials in those days , electronica was so trendy that madonna jumped on two different techno bandwagons in swift succession , assimilating the euphoric riffs of trance with ray of light and aping the spangly effervescence of french house on music the bullish mood in the electronic community back then was typified by paul oakenfold , the british superstar dj , who tried to break his moistly emotional brand of trance in america , in the belief that this country was set to be dance music s next big commercial frontier quite the opposite happened in the new millennium , the mainstream profile of dance music dipped alarmingly this downturn occurred on both sides of the atlantic , but it was particularly precipitous in america , where electronica was edged off of the charts by the twin juggernauts of numetal and poppunk , along with the perennial might of hiphop but it was n't just a case of massmedia gatekeepers abandoning electronic music something was ailing at the grass roots of the scene formerly packed superclubs began to close , or move to smaller venues large raves , once the mainstay of dance culture , became nearly extinct rave is dead in the los angeles area , says the west coast scene watcher dennis romero , who is news editor at the dance magazine bpm as recently as 2001 , southern california was still the most vibrant rave scene in america , but according to mr romero , the kids just are n't coming out to big events anymore , partly because of ecstasy burnout the superclubs here are starting to see diminishing numbers as well , mr romero says , with popular nights like spundae taking a hiatus and red closing down altogether not only were sales of crossoveroriented electronica plummeting the underground dance music sold in specialist record stores also declined some of those shops have closed because business is slow and record labels are suffering people i know who run labels keep getting worse and worse news , says william linn , a san franciscobased dance party promoter partly it s because of the internet , people just taking the music for free but it s also because people are n't buying the stuff in the way they were when the music was a really new thing back in the early 90 s during that rave culture heyday , an underground anthem could sell anywhere from 10 , 000 to 50 , 000 copies today , shifting a thousand copies of a 12inch single is considered a good result what happened \? one cause is the continued fragmentation of dance culture into myriad microgenres with narrow aesthetic parameters and niche followings another factor is musical overproduction , which effectively divides the pie into smaller slices but the overall pie also seems to be shrinking as well dance music has simply lost the ear of the floating consumer this may be , in part , a matter of fashion electronic dance music had been around long enough to lose its new kid on the subcultural block status the music had become familiar , and familiarity bred ennui other genres have certainly suffered this kind of problem dance music is going through the kind of midlife crisis that afflicts any genre that s been around a while \( think rock music in the 1980 s \) we 're just waiting for the next big new thing in dance music to come along , says norman cook , the man behind fatboy slim right now we 're between new things , and no one quite knows what the next one will be the central idea of electronic music s unwritten manifesto was always to surge fulltilt into the future but in recent years many creators of dance music have been investigating the genre s own history , reworking ideas from electro , synthpop and italodisco even more oddly , others have been looking to rock music for reinvigoration mr cook s palookaville used rock instrumentation \( guitar and bass \) and more conventional verse chorus song structures last year s biggest dancefloor anthem was alter ego s rocker , whose simple , chugging rhythm and squealing riffs are transparently modeled on heavy metal swaths of daft punk s new album , human after all , resemble an electronicized version of hard rock two highly touted early 2005 albums , the selftitled debut from lcd soundsystem and mu s out of breach , have a roughhewn , live garage punk feel to much of their contents other currently hot outfits like black strobe , tiefschwarz and kiki hark back to 80 s alternative rock genres like goth and industrial kiki s end of the world , for instance , features the finnishborn producer paying vocal homage to the doomy , hollowdrone baritone of andrew eldritch of the gothrock gods sisters of mercy perhaps the most bizarre example of dance music ransacking rock s archives was last year s fad for schaffel \( german for shuffle \) , which involved producers renovating the stomping rhythms of 70 s glam rock artists like t rex and gary glitter it s hard to say whether all these different forms of rockified techno represent a subconscious attempt by the scene to ingratiate its way back into the mainstream , or are simply a case of producers looking for genrecrossing thrills but none of them exactly restake dance music s claim as the music of the future alongside its commitment to constant innovation , another central tenet of dance culture was the idea of being underground , an outlaw scene in the early days , dance culture was oriented around oneoff raves in unusual locations , often involving organizers breaking into warehouses or invading outdoor spaces proper safety codes were rarely observed , drugs were rife and the behavior of the participants verged on anarchy gradually , the thrills and dangers of raves were replaced by the more reliable pleasures offered by superclubs organized by professionals and regularly scheduled but still fairly wild in terms of drugfueled hedonism today , the action is mostly in small clubs like apt \( 419 west 13th street \) and ikon \( 610 west 56th street \) in manhattan in some cases barely more than glorified bars there , the audience exudes a cleancut , metrosexual aura at times it feels as if the room has been teleported to a chic bar in barcelona or berlin , especially as , more often than not , the dj is from europe germany , in particular , is the spiritual homeland for american dance hipsters these days most of the leading labels kompakt , bpitch control , playhouse , get physical are based there in fact , some north american dj s and producers like richie hawtin have moved to germany because the climate for electronic music is more supportive if neither sonic futurism nor underground edginess apply any longer , electronic dance music s remaining raison d' tre is , well , dancing but in recent years it may have been beaten on the shakeyourbooty front by dancehall and southern rap in response , some dance producers have started to draw upon raucously vibrant street beats crunk , miami bass , dancehall , grime and so forth the result is a growing hybrid genre , highlighted on the recent , excellent compilation shockout , known as breakcore purveyed by artists like dj rupture and teamshadetek , the music combines rumbling basslines , fidgety beats and grainy ragga vocals to create a homelistening surrogate for the bashment vibe of a jamaican sound system party others within the breakcore genre , like knifehandchop , kid 606 and soundmurderer , hark back to rave s own early days , their music evoking the rowdy fervor of a time when huge crowds flailed their limbs to a barrage of abstract noise and convulsive rhythm it s a poignant aural mirage of a time when techno music was made for the popular vanguard rather than a connoisseurial elite , as it is today today s sharpest contemporary dance music operators , like tiefschwarz or lcd soundsystem , are roughly equivalent to recombinant rock auteurs of the 90 s like pj harvey and pavement , who generated sounds that were n't strictly innovative but managed to somehow feel original tiefschwarz s brothersinproduction duo ali and basti schwarz and lcd s james murphy have an almost scholarly knowledge of dance music history they 're adept at getting period sounds , but they combine them in fresh ways on lcd s album and tiefschwarz s

portland , ore , jan 14 sasha cohen s porcelaindoll face betrayed few of the emotions that often wreak havoc behind it she glided through her short program at the united states championships on thursday night with the slightest slip , touching her hand on the ice after landing a triple jump , but her face never wavered , her smile remaining stubbornly bright through the rest of the program cohen was in second place behind michelle kwan heading into saturday s long program , putting her close enough to imagine finally beating the woman who seems to own this competition kwan has won the last seven united states championships and eight over all cohen has finished second to her three times only a month after switching coaches and moving back home to try to salvage this opportunity , cohen says she believes she has found the way to silence the doubts of years past i was looking for something or someone to make me no 1 , to make me be able to do what i had n't been doing , to be perfect , cohen said friday and i kind of realized over the last two years , that person is me so cohen said she immediately put thursday night s slip behind her and recovered to finish the second half of the tripledouble combination , all without a crack in the smile this year i really look at it as me going out to enjoy it , cohen said when i skate well , i'm enjoying the art of the skating it takes the nervousness away and helps me enjoy what i'm doing if cohen does win , finally matching her prodigious talent with the ability to chase away her emotional demons , her desperate move in december will have been worth it it was middecember when cohen felt as if everything was falling apart she was working with her coach , robin wagner , the woman who tutored sarah hughes to a gold medal in the 2002 olympics , in hackensack , nj , and nothing was going well cohen injured her back over the summer and battled a stubborn illness that required a series of antibiotics to knock out she was miserable , and her confidence , always wobbly , was shot she was also homesick she asked her former coach , john nicks , if he would coach her again and piece together her ragged routines and she moved back to costa mesa , calif , where she grew up the twist was that she wanted to do it in four weeks and be ready for the united states championships cohen and nicks say the move has been a success the short program she skated on thursday was her first in nearly a year he has given me confidence in my skating , taught me not to worry so much about the jumping , but to really perform the program , cohen said the move reunites one of the oddest couples in skating while cohen was training under nicks leading up to the 2002 olympics , they argued almost constantly nicks often looked like an exasperated grandfather trying to reason with his teenage granddaughter the 75yearold nicks and cohen , who is 20 , now say she has matured significantly , helping the dynamics of their relationship i think i'm able to use a lot more of what he has to offer , cohen said i learned a lot in my two years on the east coast nicks agreed that cohen had grown , more emotionally than physically only one thing has changed , nicks said i was an old man then and she was a young girl , and i'm an old man and she s a young lady that s the only difference kwan and cohen will draw the most attention in the long program , the short program having affirmed their place atop the sport the youngsters behind them showed promise , in particular 15yearold kimmie meissner , but none seemed quite ready to challenge for the top meissner finished fourth in the short program and hoped to move up in the standings by landing a triple axel in her long program no american woman has landed a triple axel in competition since tonya harding in 1991 but jumps are not really the focal point of the women s competition kwan does not do a tripletriple combination , and cohen is lauded far more for her spins and elegance than for the difficulty of her jumps even meissner said that what set kwan and cohen apart was not degree of difficulty the difference between me and michelle and sasha is they skate very big , and they have a lot of emotion when they skate , meissner said i'm really working on that to get that up to their level i have a long way to go having emotions has never been the problem for cohen in her quest to topple kwan controlling them has figure eights the ice dancing team of tanith belbin and ben agosto won their second straight united states championships on friday afternoon , earning perfect 60 s for presentation but they will not be representing the united states at the 2006 olympics , because belbin is from quebec and will not be eligible for citizenship until 2007
aspen , colo , dec 11 she can streak her hair pink and speak in , like , the vernacular of 18yearolds , but then kristina koznick will have a race like the world cup slalom sunday at aspen mountain and feel her age acutely koznick , who turned 30 last month , placed 14th her combined time in the two runs was 1 minute 3824 seconds , putting her 223 seconds behind the winner , anja paerson of sweden janica kostelic of croatia had a seemingly insurmountable lead of 084 after the first run , but she skied too conservatively in her second , giving her a total of 1 3604 , threehundredths of a second behind paerson kathrin zettel of austria was third in 1 3644 koznick , a native of minnesota , has said she is 999 percent sure she will retire at the end of the season , meaning sunday s race was probably her last world cup competition in the united states to train well but not be rewarded with a podium finish is harder to take when one cannot shrug and say , oh , well , maybe next year koznick , who placed third just over a year ago in a world cup slalom on the same hill , said afterward , it s pretty disappointing , because , obviously , i would have liked to have won a world cup in the us , but she laughed ruefully , then stopped to gather herself as tears welled in her eyes koznick wiped her eyes with her sleeve and took a big breath , then said it s pretty disappointing because i 've been training really well i finally feel really comfortable on my skis i know i'm not far off i 've just got to try to keep my head up and keep going by the end of the interview , koznick was smiling and laughing but those few seconds of vulnerability were evidence of the emotional edge she is skiing on as she tries one last time to shed her reputation as a bigtime ski racer who does not ski well in the biggest races she was asked later what had triggered the tears it s because i know that i'm better than 14th place , she said when you 're practicing well and not seeing the results , it s tough to hold them back koznick , a slalom specialist , has won six world cup titles in her 15 seasons with the united states ski team , but none since 2003 in world championship competitions , she has never finished higher than eighth in two olympics , her best finish was 17th , and that was in giant slalom i think that she s probably had a really tough career compared to most people , said julia mancuso , a californian who placed 19th sunday she has n't had the best of luck at the big events she s always right in there , but she ca n't quite dominate for her it s frustrating , but at the same time , you know , she does have those wins so she knows she was the best at one point koznick tried to be philosophical through her tears yeah , for sure i have yet to accomplish all my goals , she said but if you hang on for those reasons , you 're never going to achieve them anyway i just have to keep giving every single race my best and see what happens martina ertlrenz of germany has been showing up for 13 years , and on sunday she was rewarded with a place in history the slalom was ertlrenz s 403rd world cup start , breaking a tie for the record with anita wachter of austria she finished 17th i'm proud of it , the 32yearold ertlrenz said what s also important is i was for four years at the top of the world cup it is a place that is hard to reach perhaps nobody knows that better than koznick the ascent does not become easier with age koznick knows that , too it s a little bit hard to focus , she said , adding , some mornings i wake up totally ready to go , and other mornings i'm not german skier needs surgery maria riesch , germany s most versatile and valuable women s ski racer , will miss the turin olympics after tearing a ligament in her left knee saturday during a crash on her second giant slalom run riesch was taken from the course on a stretcher and has returned to munich , where she will have surgery this week riesch , 21 , won world cup races in the downhill , superg and slalom two seasons ago but sat out most of last season after surgery on her right knee
baton rouge , la , sept 13 confusion and desperation permeated the new orleans hospital system as floodwaters rose , emergency generators failed and dozens of patients died in the three chaotic days after the levees broke , doctors and other witnesses said on tuesday while all of the city s major hospitals had detailed evacuation and emergency plans , officials said , none were prepared for a catastrophic flood and each responded differently when disaster struck at memorial medical center , where 45 bodies were discovered this week , staff members said they could do little more than try to comfort dying patients frightened and exhausted nurses and doctors squeezed handheld ventilators for patients who could not breathe the cook reduced the daily meal ration from three to two to one doctors ranked patients for evacuation by helicopter , taping a number to each patient , with 3 for the sickest and 1 for the least critical charity and university , two public hospitals that are part of the louisiana state university system , did not have the money to hire helicopter companies to evacuate patients , said don smithburg , the system s chief executive as a result , they were among the last to be evacuated the two hospitals relied almost entirely on the military and federal authorities charity and university managed to evacuate their 28 babies 18 of them in intensive care only by early friday morning , nearly two days after the other hospitals twenty bodies were left behind at the two hospitals 12 of the patients had died before the storm at memorial , a private 317bed hospital opened in 1926 , there were patients who were lying on the floor , said dr john j walsh jr , a surgeon who stayed until the early hours of friday , sept 2 , when helicopters finally evacuated the last patients dr walsh compared the scene to the railyard hospital for wounded soldiers in gone with the wind , saying the nurses were basically standing , and giving them food or water there were some medications we could give , but nothing like modern medicine we were back to the 1800 s the hospital s owner , the tenet healthcare corporation , the country s secondlargest hospital chain , said on tuesday that of the 45 dead , 25 were patients in an 82bed acutecare ward run by lifecare holdings , of plano , tex , that was full at the time of the storm officials at lifecare did not respond to three telephone messages a tenet spokesman , harry anderson , acknowledged that the failure of ventilators , dialysis machines and heartrate monitors contributed to the deaths of patients the hospital s generators shut down as part of a general failure of the entire electrical system , not because of low fuel , he said of the 45 bodies , 8 to 11 had died before the storm dr louis cataldie , the state s emergency medical director , said he did not fault the management for the deaths i do n't think it s any reflection on that hospital , he said they did all the right things they ultimately got their own helicopters to come in the suffering at the hospital played out over four anguished days on sunday , aug 28 , as city officials ordered an evacuation of the city , hundreds of residents began streaming into memorial , in the city s uptown section about 260 patients were there , not including the lifecare ward in the early hours of monday , hospital employees awoke with relief the wind had shattered windows and the glass walkways connecting the buildings and parking garages , and water had pooled around the complex , but there was little structural damage around 4 30 am , the main power lines to the hospital were disrupted and the backup generators kicked on by dusk on monday , most of the people who had taken refuge in the hospital had left but hundreds of people stayed behind all of them assumed they would be able to leave within a day or so on tuesday morning , the hospital s chief executive , l ren goux , called an emergency meeting the administrators decided to evacuate the hospital and not to admit more evacuees from the neighborhood the telephones had died , and mr goux began sending frantic email messages to tenet s headquarters in dallas , requesting assistance company officials began calling the coast guard , the national guard and even h ross perot , the investor and former presidential candidate , who is a friend of tenet s chief executive , trevor fetter meanwhile , workers at memorial managed to clear up an abandoned landing pad , on top of the magnolia street parking garage , for use as a heliport they strung together extension cords from the generator to the landing pad and shined lights to guide the pilots getting patients to the helipad was not easy they were passed through a threebythreefoot hole on the second floor , which led from a maintenance room into the parking garage from there , vehicles drove the patients up the ramp then they had to be unloaded and carried up three flights of steps to the landing pad nothing was clear at least two helicopters tried to land on the helipad and deliver evacuees to the hospital , which was trying to clear everyone out some pilots only wanted to take pregnant women , or babies meanwhile , private boats started ferrying away the 1 , 800 residents who had taken shelter at memorial they were taken to dry land on st charles avenue from there , they left on foot or in buses around 1 30 am on wednesday , the generators started to fail lights flickered and died dr timothy allen , an anesthesiologist , was astonished we were told and we believed that our generators would last six days , and of course they died after two and onehalf days , whether because they shorted out or were flooded , he said on wednesday evening , the boats stopped before everyone could be evacuated about 115 patients were left we were waiting , lined up , said mary jo d'amico , a longtime nurse at memorial who evacuated on the night of sept 1 we figured that once a boat came , we 'd be ready to go when nightfall came on wednesday and we still did n't have all our patients out and the boats had stopped , we just brought them in , fed them , gave them more fluids and put them on cots so they could rest and helicopters never arrived that night william p quigley , a law professor at loyola university who was at memorial until that afternoon with his wife , debbie , an oncology nurse , said they did n't have enough food one night , i remember one of the doctors saying , 'if you 've eaten food today , we ca n't feed you tonight' then they passed out little tin cans of vienna sausage by thursday morning , doctors were in crisis mode we said we had to find a way to get these people out faster , dr allen said we could just sense what was coming it was so hot we were down to one meal a day there was no running water or sewage at 9 am , six helicopters chartered by tenet finally started arriving , carrying away wave after wave of patients and evacuees the last living patient left that evening for others , help had come too late as people died , they were wrapped into blankets , said dr glenn a casey , the chief anesthesiologist and one of three doctors who left on the final flight we did n't have body bags to put them in john j finn , president of the metropolitan hospital council of new orleans , said the chiefs of the city s 20 hospitals had realized late last year in a planning exercise that they should come up with a plan to cope with a devastating hurricane we were going to fix those things in our planning , he said we just ran out of time
london , feb 21 five years after britain lifted its ban on gays in the military , the royal navy has begun actively encouraging them to enlist and has pledged to make life easier when they do the navy announced monday that it had asked stonewall , a group that lobbies for gay rights , to help it develop better strategies for recruiting and retaining gay men and lesbians it said , too , that one strategy may be to advertise for recruits in gay magazines and newspapers commodore paul docherty , director of naval life management , said the service wanted to change the atmosphere so that gays would feel comfortable working there while some gays were confident to come out , others did n't feel that the environment was necessarily accepting of them , commodore docherty said in an interview the partnership with stonewall , commodore docherty said , will help make more steps toward improving the culture and attitude within the service as a whole , so gays who are still in the closet feel that much more comfortable about coming out gays in britain have benefited from a number of new laws , including one that makes it illegal for employers to discriminate on the basis of workers' sexuality last year , parliament passed the civil partnership act , which gives marriagestyle rights to british gays who have registered as couples the entire military is subject to the legislation , and starting in the fall , gay couples in the military who have registered under the act will be allowed to apply for housing in quarters previously reserved for married couples the new effort continues a pattern of changing official attitudes in the navy once derided as running on rum , sodomy and the lash , in a phrase usually attributed to winston churchill and while most european militaries have lifted bans on gays , none have been as active as the royal navy in encouraging their service until a european court ruled in 1999 that britain s ban on gays in the military violated european humanrights laws , the navy , along with the rest of the country s military , followed a noexceptions policy of dismissing service men and women who were found to be gay , often after long and intrusive investigations the military had agonized for years over the issue , in the way the united states has , and always concluded that allowing gays and lesbians to serve would prove prohibitively disruptive and would ruin discipline and cohesion but after the court ruling , it had no choice but to reverse its policy beginning in 2000 , the military said gays would no longer be prohibited from serving it also stopped monitoring its recruits' sex lives , saying that sexuality , as long as it did not intrude into the workplace , should not be an issue one way or another recently , gay men and women in the british services have lived and fought in iraq alongside heterosexuals without problems , according to military officials i would say that before the european court ruling , it was difficult to see this policy happening or working , said lt cmdr craig jones , a gay naval officer who often speaks publicly , with the navy s approval , on gay rights issues people were quite hot under the collar about it the admirals , generals and air marshals were really concerned , he added i'm quite sure that these folks look now and think , 'what was all that fuss about \? ' most european countries , including france , germany , spain , switzerland and denmark , have lifted their bans on gays in the military but britain , and particularly the navy , has gone further , said aaron belkin , director of the center for the study of sexual minorities in the military at the university of california , santa barbara in a lot of cases what you have is a legal commitment to nondiscrimination , but a quiet continuation of previous cultural norms , mr belkin said but here you have not only a reversal of policy and a formal commitment to nondiscrimination , but a proactive embracing of the idea that integration is good for the military and diversity is useful for recruiting from the fullest possible pool in britain , stonewall currently advises about 90 employers , some of them big companies , about how better to recruit and treat gay and lesbian workers it is this program that the navy has signed up for increasingly , organizations are recognizing that having welltrained and highly committed staff who feel comfortable in the workplace is highly important , said alan wartle , a spokesman for stonewall it s about having a range of policies and also about the more intangible element , the cultural change commodore docherty said one likely step for the navy would be to begin advertising in gay publications , as part of a general recruitment effort we advertise in a lot of magazines , he said for instance , we advertise in cycling and swimming magazines not because we 're after cyclists and swimmers particularly , but because it s part of our target audience of 16to24yearolds gays in the british military are subject to the same rules of sexual conduct as heterosexuals no touching , no kissing , no flaunting of sexuality since 1991 , women have been allowed to serve with men on ships , which operate under strict no sex rules , and sailors in such close quarters have relied on what one naval official said was common sense and good manners despite the change in policy , relatively few gay men and lesbians in the military whether because of fear of being intimidated , or because of personal choice have come out the services do not keep statistics on the number of gays , holding by the principle , commander jones said , that sexuality is a private matter for the individual he called the announcement by the navy on monday a huge step forward you get folks like me who choose to be out , and there are others who do n't it s up to them , he said we 've come a very , very long way in five years , but we do n't want to be complacent commodore docherty said the navy was trying to send a clear message the fact that we are making this highlevel commitment will hopefully show people that it s not just empty words when we talk about diversity and opportunity , he said , but are actually taking action to do something about it
vintage photographs , 19701980 tibor de nagy gallery 724 fifth avenue , at 57th street through oct 8 the thing squats on the surface of a clear connecticut pond , a monstrous excrescence that suggests a primitive idol or a giant frog mutation the photograph , taken close up from behind at pond level , actually depicts sticking out of the water the upturned face , head and shoulders of the finnishborn photographer arno rafael minkkinen , who since the early 1970 s has been shooting parts of his nude body , mostly in conjunction with natural sites in another , more delicate photograph , mr minkkinen s long , bony leg dangles disembodiedly over the stern of a broadbottomed rowboat against a backdrop of lake , sky and firs in a third the soles of his feet appear magically in the branches of a tree , shot from below , the broad distortion of the feet concealing the body attached to them the amazing thing is that none of these very artful pictures have been subjected to darkroom or other manipulation they are exactly what the lens registers mr minkkinen s interest in the interaction of the nude body it is not always his own and the environment , sometimes witty and tricky , others deeply primordial , intrigues because it suggests the kind of ethereality that earthlings have always longed for , positing the self as a fact of art as well as of nature he has been intermittently inspired by the kalevala , the finnish national epic that tells of the extraordinary feats of three godlike brothers , and some of his photographs , made in journeys all over the world , have elements of fantasy and mythology although mr minkkinen s work is inevitably seen as part of the conceptual mode of body photography practiced by artists like lucas samaras , bruce nauman , john coplans and vito acconci , it has a wizardry that defies categorization grace glueck
alaa altamimi , the mayor of baghdad , happens to be an admirer of rudolph w giuliani with a sheepish smile that concedes the irony of his little revelation , dr tamimi said he liked how mr giuliani , as new york s mayor , touted the broken windows philosophy of policing , which asserts that stopping petty crime can keep big crime from happening but dr tamimi , a civil engineer and relentless secularist who also believes in strict zoning enforcement and trash recycling , has had a tough time using much of that philosophy in his own job , which he has held for 16 months in fact , after returning from exile last year with ambitious plans and a great burst of enthusiasm , dr tamimi seems to move around baghdad under the weight of everything that has gone wrong in a city that he loves with a passion second to none of the bigcity mayors in the united states on thursday , so ill that at times he could barely be heard , dr tamimi sat behind a bank of microphones at a packed news briefing in the dingy municipal building and berated an iraqi reporter for what he regarded as stupid questions about the latest collapse of the city s water system , after yet another sabotage attack the real problem , dr tamimi said , was that he could not run a crumbling city of more than six million people when the central government had decided to give him only 85 million of the 1 billion he had requested he repeated his threat , first leveled at the prime minister a few weeks ago , to resign this summer if he could not get more financial help to make his city function with at least minimal efficiency anyone cannot continue in his post without means , dr tamimi said , switching to english for the benefit of the lone western reporter in the room my means it s my budget money he took a sip of the mixture of apricot , orange and peach juice that veiled attendants repeatedly place in front of him during the ceaseless meetings that make up his day kanan makiya , who was born and raised in baghdad and is the author of republic of fear , a book documenting the terror of saddam hussein s government , said dr tamimi s modern and technically farsighted approach was a remarkable opportunity for baghdad but mr makiya added he s working in almost impossible conditions his budget is just a joke it s a complete joke despite dr tamimi s protestations over the budget , his problems go well beyond a lack of money the city he governs is so treacherous that when he does business outside the municipal building , he tries not to tell anyone where he is going and shows up unannounced , staying in one spot no longer than 20 to 30 minutes as if to drive home the point , his director general of sewage was assassinated six weeks ago and after the euphoria that dr tamimi felt when 51 percent of baghdad s voters turned out for the january elections , he has been saddled with a city council dominated by a shiite clerical party that is threatening to strip him of his authority and fire several of his top managers it is a sore point with the council that dr tamimi himself was put in office last year not by a direct election but by a vote of local leaders who were carefully chosen by the american occupation the disagreement has tried the mayor s patience to such a degree that he has taken to poking fun at the council members' facial hair a sign of their conservative religious allegiances i agree that the election was free and democratic , dr tamimi said in an interview in his home in monsour , a building surrounded by the kind of ugly concrete blast walls he once pledged to remove from baghdad s streets but now accepts as unavoidable but i should tell you that the people who were elected are not representing the people of baghdad i ca n't accept that there are no people without mustaches , said dr tamimi , whose cleanshaven face , despite all his cares , is remarkably younglooking for someone born in 1952 i cannot accept that there are no people without beards his postelection depression is not so different from that of many secular iraqi politicians , including ayad allawi , who as a resourcestrapped prime minister last year was forced to give dr tamimi that skimpy budget i tried to help him , but we were under constraints , dr allawi said regarding the mayor s panoply of troubles , dr allawi said with the slow chuckle of someone who is no longer on the firing line , i know he is on the verge of being quite fed up it was not supposed to be this way when dr tamimi , exuding confidence and democratic idealism , left his wife and son in canada and came back to iraq last year he said that when he fled iraq across the western desert in 1995 , he had told himself that he would return either after his death or after mr hussein s government fell but he got his second chance , and his credentials boded well for success after earning undergraduate and master s degrees from baghdad university and a phd in france , he worked both at the university and in iraq s atomic weapons program , until it was disbanded and largely destroyed after the 1991 persian gulf war although some iraqis believe that dr tamimi is ready to pack it in , others see his resignation threat as a bit of brinkmanship , a way of drawing attention to the plight of the city , said mr makiya , the author most ordinary residents of baghdad have little to say about dr tamimi beyond criticism of the trashremoval services , overflowing sewage mains and chewedup streets i have n't seen any improvement , said bashar aljaleeli , 37 , a sales manager who lives in northern baghdad , speaking of work done by municipal employees and if they try to make progress , it leads to the opposite for instance , if they want to install a water pipe , they dig up the street and leave it like that for a long time , he said the work is sloppy dr tamimi , who says he reads all the local newspapers every day , is extremely sensitive to such criticism at the same time , he feels he has been let down by the americans , who among other things canceled a 15 million project to build what would have been baghdad s first sanitary landfill and are behind on a range of sewage and water projects still , his old idealism was on display at two recent staff meetings in one , he described to a group of city officials his observations of a recycling program during one of his trips abroad glass in the red bag , plastic in the blue , and so on everyone paid careful attention , although it was clear that he might as well have been lecturing on the social habits of martians for all the connection it had to baghdad in another , he pushed his model streets program , intended to build one bright , clean , renovated and repaved thoroughfare in each of 11 baghdad districts so iraqis could see what life might be like if they did not summarily throw their uncollected garbage onto the nearest median , a common practice now even his archrival , mazin a makkia , head of the city council , cannot fault dr tamimi s affection for baghdad he has an ambition to do good things , mr makkia said but he added ambitions are not achieved by dreams i have to move on the ground photo mayor alaa altamimi taking notes during a news briefing in his office his attempts to bring services to baghdad residents are frustrated by a lack of money , and he has threatened to quit and return to canada \( photo by max becherer polaris , for the new york times \)
nothing good really came out of the 199495 strike , but the players' walkout did save major league baseball from one potential embarrassment had the strike not abruptly ended the season on aug 10 , 1994 , baseball could have had a division champion with a losing record when the strike began , the texas rangers led the american league west with a 5262 record had the season continued , the rangers would have had 48 games left on the schedule and a chance to finish with a winning record but that would have meant winning 30 of the 48 games to finish at 8280 , and the team did n't seem capable of such a run the rangers , who lost their last six games before the strike , had led the division since may 30 , a period of 73 days , and they had a winning record on only four of those days that was n't a promising backdrop for them to rally in the final 48 games , which brings us to the san diego padres and the national league west the padres crept back over 500 on sunday with a divisionleading 5655 record , but they had fallen below 500 on july 29 , remaining in first place with a losing record for eight days they improved to 5755 with an 83 victory over the mets last night in san diego no one in the division was able to supplant the padres during that stretch the arizona diamondbacks came closest , tying the padres for first for two days , but the diamondbacks , who lost last night to the marlins , fell four games behind the padres we 're 51 in august , kevin towers , the padres' general manager , said yesterday maybe our august will be like may in may , the padres were 226 they had an eightgame winning streak and a pair of sixgame winning streaks they swept threegame series against colorado , florida , atlanta and san francisco , and they won three of four against st louis but their 3319 record at the end of the month dissolved into a losing record two months later the sixandahalfgame lead they built by midjuly also disappeared they reached the nadir of their season late last month , when they lost eight consecutive games and 12 of 13 , suffering successive threegame sweeps in new york and philadelphia , then another to cincinnati they caught us at a time when we were n't playing well , towers said he could have been talking about all of those teams , but towers was speaking specifically about the mets , who held the padres to four runs in three games offensively we 're a lot better than we were 10 days , 2 weeks ago , he added the mets' series in san diego is part of a schedule this week in which the nl west will primarily play the nl east , matching the league s weakest division against its strongest all five teams in the east have winning records , and four of them , all but firstplace atlanta , make up the wildcard race with houston of the central division the east , i think , has always been strong , towers said going into this year , it was no secret it was going to be a strong division , probably the most competitive division the biggest surprise has probably been the nationals , but atlanta has always been strong and based on what they did in the winter in new york and florida , they were going to be strong would he pick a division winner \? you ca n't bet against atlanta , towers said , adding i still think the wild card will come out of there , too houston s playing great right now , but i think there are too many strong teams in the east however the west teams finish , whether all or none have winning records , one of the five teams will participate in the playoffs commissioner bud selig cannot order a different makeup of the nl playoffs , even though it may be in the best interests of baseball to exclude a team with a losing record from postseason competition or maybe the padres will have a fantastic finish over their final 51 games \( similar to what the rangers might have done in '94 \) and make everyone forget that they flirted with a losing record towers , in fact , believes the division will generally have a strong finish because players whose injuryforced absences have hurt their teams are returning and will make the teams better i think there will be more than one team finishing over 500 , he said i still think it 'll take 8586 games to win the division in the end , winning the division is all that towers cares about we were 14 games over 500 at one time , he said , recalling the team s 3319 record at the end of may we 're one over now i do n't care what our record is , as long as we get into the playoffs once you do that , you never know what s going to happen the wildcard winners of recent seasons can endorse that view the angels in 2002 , the marlins in 2003 and the red sox last year were all wild cards that won the world series but those teams posted good wonlost records during the regular season if any team , division winner or wild card , were to finish the season with a losing record but get hot in the postseason and win the world series , it would be embarrassing for baseball it is no accident , on the other hand , that it has never happened it wo n't happen this year either
foxboro , mass , jan 16 with his silver pants and dark blue jersey covered by a mottled mix of grass stains , paint and mud , new england patriots running back corey dillon sat on an aluminum bench on the sideline at gillette field on sunday , looking exhausted and frozen only a few minutes remained in the patriots' 203 victory over the indianapolis colts , and dillon was resting he stared at the field , snowflakes swirling around his head as the realization of his first playoff victory swirled inside it in seven previous seasons playing for the cincinnati bengals , dillon had never had a winning season , much less a playoff victory so he was stunned sunday on an evening he had always dreamed of , he was the star of the american football conference divisional playoff game , running for 144 yards on 23 carries i'm not even recognizing my last seven seasons , dillon said i 've been through some things over the last seven seasons i 've been through some really hard things but this is what i wanted this is what i'm doing right now everything is pretty good right now the patriots traded a secondround draft pick for the unhappy dillon before this season , plucking him from the perennially bad bengals , where he had six straight 1 , 000yard rushing seasons it was not a secret that dillon wanted to get away from the team that had drafted him in 1997 in 2000 , dillon told a seattle radio station that he would rather flip burgers than play for the bengals again but he stayed with them until landing with the patriots , having won only 34 games in those seven seasons only once , in 2003 , did the bengals not have a losing season even then , they were only 88 on sunday night , though , dillon found himself on a 152 team headed for the afc championship game , thanks to his crafty , powerful runs during the season , he rushed for a teamrecord 1 , 635 yards , playing it down as just his job but after beating indianapolis , dillon said the game was special you can see it in his eyes that he has waited a long time for this , offensive tackle matt light said it s so great to see something like this happen to him , because he s just an amazing player and it s good for us , too when he has a good game , usually good things happen to us dillon thought about none of that in the days before his first playoff game he kept to himself , staying out of the locker room to avoid reporters and steering clear of the pregame hype he laid low amid the ruckus surrounding the matchup between quarterbacks tom brady and peyton manning until the game , that is because , as it turned out , this was not a game of quarterbacks , but a game of running backs and managing the clock and so , after a week of silence , dillon finally spoke up , and spoke loudly , with his legs pumping hard as he ran past grappling defenders on the tornup field the patriots kept their hands on the ball and out of manning s hands for 37 minutes 43 seconds the team ran for 210 yards , and the 68 , 756 fans at gillette stadium appreciated it in the fourth quarter , people in the stands began chanting dillon s name , first as he walked off the field to take a break when they yelled coreee ! coreee ! he turned his head and nodded after the game , though , dillon walked to one end of the field and lifted his arms to the fans , encouraging their cheers how nice it was to be appreciated , he said later , adding that it was so nice to finally be called a winner still , dillon avoided giving himself credit for the victory on a field that became slippery soon after kickoff because of the snow he said it was the entire team that beat the colts it was n't a oneman show , he said it was everyone put together after the game , dillon stood at his locker , surrounded by reporters , television cameras on and microphones shoved in his face he looked uncomfortable amid the attention , answering questions with quick sentences as his giant , diamondencrusted crucifix shone in the camera lights at first , he pushed people back , saying , hey , ca n't a brother take a shower around here \? one locker over , his fellow running back kevin faulk , who had 11 runs for 56 yards , glanced at dillon and laughed he is happy , even if he may not look like it right now , faulk said to be honest with you , i think every game he wins , he is overwhelmed that s what happens when you are used to losing so many games , then suddenly start to win a bunch
washington , april 23 a human rights group issued a report on saturday calling for a special prosecutor to examine the conduct of secretary of defense donald h rumsfeld and the former director of central intelligence , george j tenet , in issues related to the abuse of detainees drawing largely on news reports and publicly available military reviews , the group , human rights watch , concluded that there was overwhelming evidence that us mistreatment and torture of muslim prisoners took place not merely at abu ghraib , but at facilities throughout afghanistan and iraq as well as at guant namo and at secret locations' around the world in violation of the geneva convention and the laws against torture the report found no indication that mr rumsfeld warned those under his command to halt abusive treatment of detainees and said that he should be investigated for abuses under a doctrine of command responsibility mr rumsfeld has said he made it clear to subordinates that he did not condone mistreatment the report found that mr tenet had been responsible for policies that sent detainees to countries where they were tortured , which made him potentially liable as an accomplice to torture mr tenet has not addressed the issue publicly , but cia officials have long said that mr tenet insisted that agency personnel carefully follow the law a special prosecutor was needed to investigate these matters , the report said , because alberto r gonzales , the attorney general , had a conflict of interest because he was himself deeply involved in the policies leading to these alleged crimes the report said that of seven investigations by the pentagon , none had critically examined the role of the civilian leaders with ultimate authority over detainee policy investigations into casebycase abuses have largely focused on lowerlevel personnel bush administration officials have repeatedly said that the government s policies prohibit civilian and military personnel from engaging in torture and that anyone found to have used abusive procedures would be held accountable and would face possible prosecution so far , the government has shown no interest in an independent inquiry republicans in congress have blocked requests by democrats to examine allegations of detainee abuse at the same time , the justice department has ignored requests to appoint a special prosecutor an army investigation has cleared all but one of the five most senior army officers who were responsible for detainee policies in iraq , according to news reports on saturday the central intelligence agency has begun internal inquiries into specific instances of abuse by intelligence officers , but the report noted that none of those inquiries or their conclusions had been made public this pattern of abuse across several countries did not result from the acts of individual soldiers who broke the rules , said a statement by reed brody , special counsel for human rights watch it resulted from decisions made by senior us officials to bend , ignore or cast the rules aside last week , the vice chairman of the senate intelligence committee , john d rockefeller , democrat of west virginia , said that congress had largely ignored the issue and offered an amendment to an appropriations bill that would require an inquiry into the treatment of detainees
we 're in the middle of the world series , once more without a home team to root for new york is so out of it that the series will be played tonight in a city , houston , that does n't even know how to pronounce its name properly you know what this means , do n't you \? it means another year without a tickertape parade along the stretch of lower broadway known as the canyon of heroes granted , this is not the worst fate possible but tickertape parades are a new york tradition going back to the late 19th century we have had exactly 200 of them , by the count of kenneth r cobb , who has researched the matter thoroughly and is an assistant commissioner in the city s department of records and information services the alliance for downtown new york has celebrated the tradition by embedding commemorative granite plaques in the sidewalks of broadway from bowling green to the woolworth building it s kind of a municipal campfire , suzanne o'keefe , the alliance s vice president for design , said of the tickertape parade how many occasions do we have to gather people together \? not very many and lately , none there has not been a parade in five years , one of the longest dry spells ever that may say something about the people we now call heroes , a word so overworked that it has begun to lose all meaning except in regard to a type of sandwich custom dictates that the mayor decides who receives this honor thus far , mayor michael r bloomberg has found no one worthy not to make too much of a factoid , but mr bloomberg is only the second mayor in the last century to skip holding such a celebration the other was abraham d beame , a man who was both paradeless and hapless after an undistinguished single term , he was voted out of office in 1977 no published poll suggests that mr bloomberg is in that kind of trouble quite the opposite still , it rarely does a new york mayor any good to be mentioned in the same breath with abe beame the recent parade drought goes hand in hand with a bleak period for new york sports teams none have won all the marbles since the yankees in 2000 , a year before mr bloomberg was elected in the main , those are our heroes these days overpaid athletes since 1991 , we have had seven parades all but one were for sports figures the exception was a 1998 celebration of senator john glenn , the former astronaut who returned to space that year aboard the shuttle discovery the senator , 77 at the time , was honored as a model for older americans indeed , many aging new yorkers were inspired some might not have been able to afford the medicines they needed but it comforted them to know that they could be shot into the upper stratosphere and beyond even that parade was a faint echo of the exuberant festivities for mr glenn in 1962 , after he became the first american to orbit the earth the reality , for well over a decade now , is that you have to be a professional athlete to qualify as a hero deserving a paperdrenched ride up lower broadway it has to do with the tenor of the times , ms o'keefe said mr cobb talked about the changing concept of the term 'hero ' at the height of paradeomania 130 of the 200 parades took place from 1945 to 1965 cold war politics ruled more than half of those heroes were visiting heads of state important to the state department they included a flock of twobit dictators whose main achievement was knowing how to put on a uniform and a pair of sunglasses some ended up leaving office feet first these days , it seems , washington is hardpressed to come up with a friendly despot a saudi prince , perhaps , or a kuwaiti emir deserving such a tribute could it be that the tickertape parade belongs to the past \? even the name is a relic how many tickers , let alone ticker tape , have you seen lately \? do n't count the parade out , ms o'keefe and mr cobb say times change , and so do attitudes a parade honoring vietnam war veterans was held in 1985 , 10 years after the troops came home korean war vets were not given their due until 1991 , 38 years after the fact at that rate , we might see a parade for veterans of the iraq war in , oh , 2043 when the dust settles , mr cobb said , you never know nyc correction october 28 , 2005 , friday the nyc column on tuesday , about a dry spell for tickertape parades in new york , omitted a couple of celebrations held over the years a fuller explanation appears in the column today , on page b1
pinellas park , fla , march 19 the morning after terri schiavo s feeding tube was removed , lawyers for her parents sought new avenues to keep her alive and protesters were arrested trying to deliver bread and water to the door of the hospice where ms schiavo , a critically braindamaged woman who a judge has ruled would not want lifeprolonging measures , lay in bed just before 11 am on saturday , three men were taken into custody when they tried to force their way past officers guarding the driveway of woodside hospice to take bread and water to ms schiavo as a symbolic gesture the three led by james gritz , a former green beret commander from nevada known as bo were arrested on misdemeanor trespassing charges , police officials said about 30 people prayed outside the hospice on saturday morning and waved signs reading stop renegade judges and colorado loves terri others stood in circles reciting the lord s prayer passersby looked on , drinking coffee the rev patrick mahoney , director of the christian defense coalition , said protesters planned to drive to tallahassee , where they would spend the next few days lobbying the state legislature and gov jeb bush to somehow force the feeding tube s reinsertion mr mahoney , one of several conservative religious leaders trying to rally a national protest of the tube removal on the ground that no life should end prematurely , said he hoped more people would travel here as ms schiavo s condition deteriorated we want a spiritual prayer witness sort of thing in pinellas park and a more political front in tallahassee , mr mahoney said he added that protesters would pressure governor bush to visit ms schiavo at her bedside , as her husband , michael , has angrily invited him to do governor bush might be her last practical hope , mr mahoney said we believe he could take her into protective custody or otherwise use his executive privileges doctors have said that ms schiavo , 41 , who suffered extensive brain damage when her heart failed 15 years ago , could live up to two weeks without the liquid meals that were provided through a gastric tube she has been the focus of a sevenyear fight between her husband , who is her legal guardian and wants her to die , and her parents , who reject court findings that she has no cognition and would not want to be kept alive artificially on saturday , both sides took their fight to television mr schiavo , appearing on today on nbc , said members of congress were trying to intrude into his personal life with lastminute maneuvers , which included issuing subpoenas for the schiavos to appear before congress and trying to move the case into federal court mr schiavo said that he was at his wife s side shortly after the tube was removed friday afternoon and that he knew it was what she wanted it felt like some peace was happening for terri , mr schiavo said in the television interview and i felt like she was finally going to get what she wants , and be at peace and be with the lord ms schiavo s brother , bobby schindler , disagreed when i visit terri , she s very much alert , she s very much alive , mr schindler said on the program as soon as we get into the room with her , she begins immediately to communicate with us mr mahoney and randall terry , the founder of the antiabortion group operation rescue , said they would continue lobbying congress to pass a bill requiring a federal court hearing in cases like ms schiavo s to evaluate whether the state had followed all requirements for judicial due process they also said they still hoped the florida legislature would pass a law requiring the tube s reinsertion or forcing the replacement of mr schiavo as his wife s guardian legal analysts have said none of these options would be likely to stop ms schiavo s death since her case has been thoroughly played out in a series of courts mr terry said that no matter what happened in the schiavo case , religious conservatives would use it to increase pressure on congress and state lawmakers to try to diminish judicial authority when congressional leaders announced saturday that they had reached a compromise on a bill to move ms schiavo s case to the federal courts , mr terry stood outside the hospice and delivered a statement we recognize that even though the house and senate , we hope , will pass this bill and the president has committed to sign it , that it could still sit in the federal judiciary , mr terry said earlier , he said the executive and legislative branches needed to stop groveling at the feet of a judicial oligarchy brandi swindell , 28 , who said she traveled from the midwest to spend the next few days staging a hunger strike in support of ms schiavo s parents , said she would not mind being arrested in an attempt to come to ms schiavo s aid i think this is a grave human rights violation , ms swindell said , and i ca n't just sit by
for years , they competed like the new york yankees and the boston red sox the new york stock exchange , with its floor traders who interact with computers and with each other , and nasdaq , with its fully automated trading system , fought fiercely for trading business , mocking each other s systems as inefficient then electronic upstarts came along , and the battle became more wide open and uncertain now , two deals may leave the field to the strengthened , traditional rivals on wednesday , the exchange announced that it would buy archipelago , an electronic trading network , and , in a reverse merger , become a public company nasdaq is expected to soon announce a deal for instinet , the remaining big electronic system the exchange s deal is the bolder of the two by becoming a public entity as well as creating a business to compete for nasdaq s listings business , the exchange answered the calls of its critics and positioned itself to take on nasdaq and global competitors we are getting back to the focused battle between longtime competitors , said richard repetto , an analyst with sandler o'neill partners , an investment firm based in new york regulators applauded the deal as evidence that their recent efforts to change the rules that govern the trading of stocks had worked the nature of competition is changing , said annette nazareth , director of market regulation at the securities and exchange commission the listed market and the nasdaq market will be competing directly with each other in ways that were n't possible before i think investors will do very well nasdaq executives were not impressed the nyse is adopting a plan to follow nasdaq s lead , said robert greifeld , chief executive of nasdaq his counterpart at the big board , john a thain , was more focused on competition from global exchanges like the deutsche b rse , owner of the german stock exchange , and euronext , the secondbiggest exchange in europe behind the london stock exchange , than on the exchange s traditional rival in announcing the deal on wednesday yesterday , in response to mr greifeld s comment , an executive at the exchange said sarcastically , yes , we always look to bob s lead the battle between the exchange and nasdaq will be fought on two fronts listings and market share in trading exchanges make money from listing fees from companies , from transaction costs on trades and from data about that trading every exchange desperately wants trades because the more trades that go to an exchange , the more offers potential buyers or sellers have before the archipelago deal , the exchange did not trade nasdaq stocks , and the nasdaq had a small market share , about 15 percent , in stocks listed on the big board if the deal is approved by the justice department , the sec , and the seat holders , the exchange will acquire archipelago s business in trading nasdaq stocks , about a fifth to a quarter of that market nasdaq , with its recent acquisition of the electronic system brut and , now possibly instinet , will dominate nasdaq trading and offer more formidable competition for stocks listed on the exchange the exchange and nasdaq will also fight publicly for listings nasdaq began a program in 2003 to allow companies to list on both markets the exchange has much stricter listing standards but through archipelago s nascent listing business , the new york exchange will now be able list smaller stocks , too mr greifeld has engaged in a strategy of cutting transaction costs around trading and focusing on the listings business mr thain s deal could put a damper on that strategy arca would not have gotten any listings , said matt andresen , president of execution services at citadel , a hedge fund based in chicago now they get more than none and it s a zero sum game that s bad news for nasdaq still , there is some concern that the listing of smaller business could cannibalize the exchange s lucrative listing business nyselisted companies pay a lot of money to get that brand the nyse brand if they offer a 'nyse lite' listing , their existing listed companies might put pressure on them to lower their fees , said one competitor who spoke on condition of anonymity the exchange s deal , and the proposed deal between instinet and nasdaq , does not bode well for regional exchanges , like the american stock exchange the strength of the smaller exchanges has been in trading products like exchangetraded funds , trading that archipelago can do faster , and in listings for smaller companies , which will likely be decimated this puts the nyse on the attack and it gives archipelago a growth opportunity and a strong brand to combat the potential nasdaqinstinet combination , said mr repetto of sandler o'neill even fidelity investments , the mutual fund giant and a longtime critic of the exchange , appeared to see merit in the deal we have long advocated that investors are better served through automated market centers and that floorbased trading markets confer unwarranted trading privileges for those on the floor , said anne crowley , a fidelity spokeswoman thus if the nysearca merger leads to greater levels of automated trading in our secondary equity trading markets , yesterday s announcement would appear to be a positive development other major traders lauded the deal from a strategic standpoint this looks like a coup , said larry leibowitz , chief operating officer for equities in the americas at ubs we need to review the details to make sure that as a major market participant this is in the best interest of the market and the best interest of seat holders many of the exchange s own floor traders , who manage trading in particular stocks , seemed confused about the impact of the deal at a quiet membership meeting late yesterday , a person who attended it said , everyone was resigned to the fact that we have to get to the next generation john thain is taking us there
irving , tex , oct 16 one by one , in the solemn voices that accompany disheartening losses , the giants talked about the opportunities that were missed during their 1613 overtime loss to the dallas cowboys the giants were badly outplayed , but they were never out of sunday s game until jose cortez made a 45yard field goal less than four minutes into overtime the cowboys exhaled in relief the giants left the texas stadium field shaking their heads the result was sudden death , but it was more like slow torture for the giants take nothing away from dallas , but we had opportunities and did n't take them , giants coach tom coughlin said one by one , in a locker room crammed with bodies and a foul mood , the giants talked about the three turnovers the cowboys committed in the first half , and how the giants converted them into only 6 points they discussed how their offense had the ball inside dallas s 21yard line three times in the second half and came away with no points , and how they had scraped their way back in the final minutes and sent the game to overtime , only to watch the ball sail between the cowboys' uprights the defeat stung so badly because a victory would have put the giants in first place in the national football conference east , a division that seems destined to be decided by one or two games like sunday s the giants are 32 and are tied for second with the philadelphia eagles and the washington redskins dallas moved to 42 none of the teams appear good enough or bad enough to split appreciably from the pack to have a chance , the giants will have to steal victories on the road , where they are 02 this season they will need to convert opportunities like the ones they had sunday somehow , the giants trailed , 76 , at halftime , despite forcing three turnovers somehow , the giants tied the score in the final minute despite giving up four secondhalf turnovers , including two near the dallas goal line the first came when eli manning threw his first interception in 125 pass attempts early in the third quarter as he tried to find plaxico burress the second , which appeared to put an end to the game , came when brandon jacobs fumbled with 1 minute 18 seconds left the giants' offense sputtered its way through 55 minutes , earning only four first downs on its first nine drives but it resurrected itself in time to spin a fascinating end to an otherwise ugly game with dallas leading , 136 , and dominating every statistical category , the giants took possession at their 26 with 4 34 left in the fourth quarter no one felt like we were out of the game , said tight end jeremy shockey , who more than doubled the team s passing yards the drive before with a 59yard reception , a drive that ended at the cowboys' 21 when manning fumbled as he was sacked given another chance on a day with so many , the giants suddenly moved the ball as they had through most of their first four games , when they became the nfl s highestscoring team manning found shockey for an 18yard gain on the first play the giants moved with short passes sprinkled with a couple of strong runs by tiki barber they connected all the dots until they faced a secondand1 at the 3 jacobs , a 6foot4 , 256pound rookie who had not carried the ball in the game , was given the handoff his legs churned toward the goal line , but he fumbled when hit by cowboys safety roy williams , who fell on the ball to the 62 , 278 fans at texas stadium , it looked like the perfect time to celebrate a victory i'm a running back , it s what i do , first carry or last carry , jacobs said softly as he sat in front of his locker i made a mistake , and that s what it was that will never happen again he was very , very , very relieved to see the giants get another chance after the cowboys picked up no yards and burned only a few seconds in their bid to secure the victory after dallas punted , the giants started at their 48 with 52 seconds left after a 28yard completion to burress , manning found shockey alone on a short crossing route the 24yard touchdown pass and the extra point tied the score with 19 seconds left it only delayed the loss the cowboys won the coin flip to begin overtime and moved 49 yards in 8 plays they then celebrated as cortez kicked the winning field goal you ca n't win football games like that , burress said we 've got to come out and execute and keep our defense off the field a little bit more the giants' offense took the blame , while an elastic defense kept the game close the cowboys gained 385 yards , and drew bledsoe completed 26 of 37 passes for 312 yards the cowboys , in a game of keepaway , held the ball for nearly 41 of the game s 64 minutes although the giants' defense managed to keep the score down , the offense did little to push it up after averaging 34 points a game , the giants mustered just 92 yards of offense in the first three quarters and managed no drives longer than 33 yards they failed to convert their first nine thirddown attempts the giants struggled to explain this somebody s got to make a play , coughlin said we 've got enough playmakers , somebody has to make a play and get us going manning finished 14 of 30 for 215 yards , including 160 in the fourth quarter shockey had 129 yards on 5 receptions we knew we had a chance at the game , but offensively we could n't get anything going , shockey said we tried everything we have to go back and really evaluate this film and see , because a lot of teams are going to take this game and really try to emulate what the cowboys did and try to stop us five of the giants' 11 remaining games are against nfc east rivals they will have plenty more chances to win the division but they now have far less leeway for squandered opportunities extra points the giants fell to 314 in games played after a bye week , the worst mark since the nfl started using byes in 1990 the cowboys , playing without the starting running back julius jones , were held to 92 yards on 38 carries they gained 24 yards a carry giants linebacker carlos emmons played after missing the previous game with a knee injury cowboys coach bill parcells earned his 169th nfl victory ,

there was a time when douglass college was considered a jewel in the crown of women s public education , when graduates like janet lippe norwood went on to advise presidents , janet evanovich became a bestselling novelist , and jaynee lavecchia became a state supreme court justice parents of the privileged in new jersey confidently sent their children to douglass but these days the institution born in 1918 as the new jersey college for women is considered by many to be a struggling secondclass outpost on the state university s sprawling campus here , where college board scores are 100 points lower than at the more prestigious rutgers college indeed , some of the young women confide that they only agreed to attend douglass because they did not get into rutgers college those differences aside , students and administrators alike are reeling from a proposal unveiled last week that would end douglass s tenure as a standalone institution on the new brunswick piscataway campus along with cook , livingston and rutgers colleges and pass from the world as the last public allwomen s college in the nation the fate of the four colleges is now in the hands of the 11member rutgers board of governors , which plans to meet as early as january to adopt all or part of the proposal it s like they 're saying we need to kill it because it s already dead , said kelly brennan , a former student government president who graduated from douglass in the spring but it s not already dead yet the controversial proposal from a 37member task force has raised a much broader question what is the role of an allwomen s college at a time when differences in society are being erased and walls can be seen as an agent of discrimination \? indeed , the proposed changes at rutgers are just the latest indications of a widespread transformation in the landscape of higher education over the last several decades today , only 2 percent of all college women graduate from allwomen s institutions , according to statistics compiled by the department of education moreover , 40 years ago , there were nearly 300 women s colleges , while today there are only about 60 in an effort to survive financially , many schools are turning coeducational or courting older and parttime students to fill their ranks linda stamato , a former acting dean at douglass and a member of the rutgers task force that produced the 178page reorganization proposal , recently said of women s colleges , i think they 're far less necessary that they were before speaking of women today , she said , they used to have few opportunities , and now they have many opportunities ms stamato went on to describe douglass as a reservation situation , and invoked the supreme court decision plessy v ferguson , the 1896 case that affirmed separate institutions for blacks and whites what we have is separate and unequal , and we ca n't seem to do anything about it , she said not surprisingly , there are many women who have entered the debate over douglass and disagree with ms stamato there s something empowering about a women s college that you do n't know about until you get there , said lisa wolfwendel , an associate professor of higher education at the university of kansas and coauthor of taking women seriously lessons and legacies for educating the majority ms wolfwendel maintains that differences that still exist between the sexes make the schools more important than ever i also believe that there are still gender inequities , she said women still make less money than men women do n't hold positions of power as much as men women have made progress in many areas of our society , but there are many areas where women are underrepresented in college in math and science some of those things are subtle and some of those things are more obvious to be sure , there are a host of problems facing the modernday women s college , as ms wolfwendel and others readily acknowledged applications to some of the lowertier colleges have dropped , and consultants and academics say the pool of ambitious and intelligent young women who want to go to allfemale schools is shrinking for a variety of reasons but defenders of the women s colleges come armed with their own sets of statistics and rationales , including faster graduation rates and successful careers for graduates according to a recent study by the women s college coalition , a washingtonbased advocacy group , graduates of women s colleges comprise 20 percent of women in the most recent congress two 1995 studies showed that graduates of women s colleges were oneandahalf times more likely than women at coed schools to pursue a career in the life or physical sciences or math two studies from 2001 and 2003 suggest that women are more satisfied with their experience at women s colleges than their counterparts at coed colleges there is something of a where the boys are conundrum among potential applicants to women s colleges as ms wolfwendel put it , the only negative outcome associated with women s colleges is that they do n't quite have the social life that other colleges have

over the summer , the new york artist zo \? heehan salda \? ook part in a new artistic phenomenon known as shopdropping , or reverse shoplifting the results are on display at real art ways in hartford the project began when the 32yearold artist , whose studio is in brooklyn , ny , bought two outfits \( pants , top and a hat or accessory \) from a local walmart she reproduced the items , in similarlooking material , bought from a fabric shop she then returned to the store and put the copies with price tags , bar codes and all identification markers from the originals on the racks where she had found the originals she did not seek a refund , and , in fact , kept the storebought items on display at real art ways are the originals alongside photographs of the reproductions the photographs were taken in her studio before she returned her version of the items to the store when i first heard about this project , i wondered why would anybody want to create handmade reproductions of generic clothing mass produced in china \? what is more , why would the artist want to risk sneaking the items back into a store and putting them on display for sale \? was she , by stealth , trying to bring couture to the masses \? or was her project a comment on lost manufacturing jobs in the united states \? or maybe even a comment on the art scene s ascendant commercialism \? any and all of these interpretations could be larded onto the work , but none are quite right the trick , it dawned on me , was not to heed what this project seems to say so much as look at what it does ms sheehan salda \? in an era of mass production and hyperconformism , had found a way to assert her individuality and creativity using the infrastructure that serves to suppress it her project was intrinsically subversive \( on the internet , there is a nationwide network of young , gungho proponents of reverse shoplifting just like ms sheehan salda \? meanwhile , i wondered about walmart , and what executives there thought of the project , or if they even knew about it i telephoned the walmart store in hartford , and found the manager and staff unaware of the project for comment , i was referred to corporate headquarters in little rock , ark , where jacquie young , a spokeswoman for the company , did not return repeated calls richard a maloney , director of trade practices , at the department of consumer protection in connecticut , was also unaware of the project he said he believed that the project did not violate health or safety laws , but that it could possibly violate trademark and copyright laws there is an applicable connecticut unfair trade practices implication here insofar as this is a misrepresentation of the original , a fake , mr maloney said in an email message back at real art ways , what is missing from the display is readily available material specifically on the shopdropping project , its genesis and aims , because to get a handle on what is going on here you really need information about the artist and her process a simple wall text might at least have helped orient visitors i spoke with the artist and had access to newsmedia materials at the gallery your first impression , viewed cold , is that this is an exhibition about shopping , or the ascendancy of the commercial in the contemporary art world these days think , for instance , of the recent proliferation of art fairs , those temporary art malls where sensory overload competes with sensory deprivation because everything sort of looks the same but once you move in a little closer and look carefully at the objects , you realize that shopping is just one link in a larger conceptual chain conceptual artists favor ideas over a finished object or image ms sheehan salda \? s a cardcarrying member of this clan , so to some extent it does not matter what the show looks like but then again , it is hard not to escape the feeling that the walmart items themselves are not much to look at cheap jeans , a floralpatterned hat , a summer bag , a blouse and a green camp shirt , among other things so what \? even the photographs , hanging next to them , are sort of bland but , happily , the idea is sort of original , and definitely witty and clever , while pushing boundaries of artistic freedom and expression in an era of rampant conservatism and consumerism , artists like ms sheehan salda \? an be counted on to give voice to our growing collective disaffection zo \? heehan salda \? is at real art ways , 56 arbor street , hartford , through oct 16 \( 860 \) 2321006 or www realartways com photos the items bought at walmart are on the left in each photograph and zo sheehan salda a s reverseshoplifted items are on the right \( photo by real art ways \)

dr clarence dennis , a pioneering developer of the heartlung bypass machine and other mechanical heart devices that have extended the lives of millions , died on july 11 in st paul he was 96 the cause was dementia , his family said dr dennis trained hundreds of surgeons at the state university of new york downstate medical center in brooklyn and at sunystony brook but his career followed a rollercoaster course shared by many other medical researchers whose initial visions turned to failure before being realized dr dennis was one of the true innovators and visionaries in the cardiovascular field , said dr michael e debakey , the trailblazing heart surgeon at the baylor college of medicine , a friend of his on april 5 , 1951 , at the university of minnesota in minneapolis , dr dennis performed the world s first openheart operation to be done with the use of a heartlung bypass machine the apparatus worked well , but the patient , a 6yearold girl , died because her heart defect , far more complicated than the surgical team had realized , was beyond any repair then possible two weeks later , dr dennis s team used the heartlung machine on a second patient , who died because of a technician s blunder during the operation still , dr dennis maintained hope , writing in the annals of surgery later that year that the device provides promise of a useful tool in further cases that promise was fulfilled two years later , on may 6 , 1953 , at jefferson hospital in philadelphia , by dr john h gibbon , who had been trying to develop a heartlung machine since the mid1930 s dr gibbon s success blasted open the door that had been locked for centuries against any medical therapeutic intrusion into the cardiovascular field , dr debakey said for eight years before that blast , dr dennis had been exchanging ideas and information with dr gibbon to avoid duplicating their efforts and speed development of a machine in 1945 , when dr dennis began his research into such an apparatus , surgeons' ability to repair a damaged heart was very limited given its dangers , the leading surgeons of the late 19th century had virtually banned efforts at heart surgery yet along the way , a few defiant leaders repaired certain types of heart defects in procedures that , dr dennis said , fired the imaginations of surgeons what surgeons needed to realize their visions more fully , however , were devices that could perform two critical functions keeping blood from the operative field so they could see what they were repairing , and providing an uninterrupted flow of oxygenrich blood through the body responding to that challenge , dr dennis used grants from the national institutes of health to experiment with dogs , on which his team achieved nearly 100 percent survival before starting on people a few weeks after the two unsuccessful operations in minneapolis , dr dennis moved to suny downstate the move , previously planned , delayed his additional efforts to perform openheart procedures until he could set up a suitable laboratory to improve the heartlung apparatus his first laboratory after arriving at downstate was in an empty funeral home , where the campus s basic sciences building now sits he converted the space to build animal quarters , a chemistry laboratory , an operating room and a small machine shop dr dennis would later say that two cardiologists had helped sway him in his decision to move to brooklyn , by promising to refer more than 160 heart patients in need of surgery but once at downstate , he said , both doctors reneged though he never understood the reason , he said , the fact is that beyond the experimental nature of the surgery , many doctors feared losing their own patients by referring them to others it was a time when cardiologists did not work as closely with heart surgeons as they do now whatever the case , dr dennis went on to perform the second successful openheart operation to use a heartlung machine the surgery took place on june 30 , 1955 , two years after dr gibbon s groundbreaking success doctors at many medical centers then began performing the procedure , though with death rates that were initially high dr dennis also developed a procedure that used a pump to help support a failing heart , and tried it on 12 patients the condition of three of them improved for up to 17 hours , but none completely recovered other researchers picked up on the concept , though , to create the ventricular assist device , or vad , which the food and drug administration recently licensed though the mechanical vad that dr dennis made did not prove to be clinically useful , he deserves a great deal of credit for developing the concept of vad s , said dr debakey , who is among a team testing such a device a platinum blond , dr dennis maintained a youthful appearance well into his later years his second wife , the former mary steinhilper , recalled that on one occasion he had to win over the confidence of a woman who initially refused to let him operate on her son because she thought that dr dennis , then a full professor , was an intern clarence dennis was born on june 16 , 1909 , in st paul , where his father , walter a dennis , was a surgeon clarence graduated from harvard , received a medical degree from johns hopkins and earned a master s degree in physiology and a phd in surgery from the university of minnesota by 1947 , seven years after getting his phd , he was a full professor of surgery at the university of minnesota and the administrative head of surgery at minneapolis general and by 1952 , a year after moving to brooklyn , he was chairman of surgery at downstate he also became surgeon in chief at the neighboring kings county hospital center he and his second wife later endowed a 1 million surgical research professorship at suny downstate , the largest endowment the institution had then ever received dr dennis worked with health officials to raise the standard of care in brooklyn hospitals , complaining that some critically ill patients were transferred to kings county hospital without their medical records and that some other centers held patients several hours until they could arrive with a load to justify the trip problems like those contributed to overcrowding at kings , he said in 1972 , dr dennis moved to what was then the national heart and lung institute , in bethesda , md , where he further helped to develop mechanical heart devices in 1975 , he moved again , to stony brook and the veterans administration hospital in northport there , he continued research on wound closures and ailments affecting the stomach and intestines , longstanding interests of his he retired in 1988 , returned to st paul , came out of retirement in 1991 to become director of the cancer detection center at the university of minnesota , then retired once more in 1996 his first marriage , to eleanor smith , ended in divorce she died about 20 years ago he is survived not only by his second wife but also by a daughter , jane wigertz , a cardiac intensive care nurse in nykoping , sweden three sons , dr richard , of reading , mass dr james , of portland ,

missoula , mont , aug 10 as the summer sun baked the bustling asphalt parking lot at bretz rv and marine , stuart and tippy reid and their little dog , alex , sank into the leather chairs and sofa in their airconditioned motor coach and waited for the paperwork on their new vehicle and their new limited liability corporation though they have lived for years in southern nevada , mr reid says , they drove their old motor home to montana to trade it in because the state has no sales tax and its vehicle registration fees are minuscule by coming here to set up a corporation , the reids estimate they will save about 15 , 000 in nevada sales tax and 3 , 500 in nevada registration fees i was skeptical , said mr reid , a retired elementary school principal i 've seen different kinds of tax dodges and things but the more i read about it , i learned it was entirely legal like an island nation with favorable tax laws that allow corporations to create a headquarters solely to avoid paying united states taxes , montana is a haven for a growing number of retirees who are hitting the road in new motor homes the phenomenon of forming a corporation in montana to skirt sales tax is the talk of rv campgrounds and chat rooms and brings those with wanderlust here from all over california , florida , even overseas to buy a luxury vehicle that typically costs 150 , 000 to 300 , 000 new at bretz or to register one bought elsewhere the reids , happy nomads , sold their house in las vegas and traded in their smaller rv for a highend purchase their new model is equipped with a talking global positioning system receiver , telling them how to get where they want to go wifi for cruising the internet a satellite dish for television reception and xm satellite radio like many other vehicles , theirs will be registered in missoula county , which has a population of just 99 , 000 yet ranks fifth nationally in the number of rv registrations in the last three years , according to statistical surveys inc , a market research company it trails los angeles county , san diego county and riverside county in california and maricopa county in arizona in missoula county alone , the number of registrations rose to 1 , 193 in 2004 , a 59 percent increase from 2002 along with having no sales tax , which can be more than 8 percent in some parts of the country , montana charges a registration fee that tops out at 30550 for a new motor home other states charge a percentage value the reids said that nevada would have charged 1 percent montana also has no vehicle inspection in return , the couple will pay legal costs that typically run 750 to 1 , 000 though montana considers the practice legal , some states take a hostile view it s really tax evasion , said mike gowrylow , a spokesman for the washington state department of revenue it s a sham , set up to avoid paying taxes in your home state states like washington that want to collect what they consider their due first have to track down the roving owners , whose addresses are available only in the corporate paperwork in their lawyers' offices mr gowrylow says that to find the cheats , as he calls them , you have to see them on the road he added , when the state patrol stops someone with a washington license and montana plates , we are going to be very suspicious washington state has identified about a dozen people who have set up limited liability corporations in montana and has ordered them to pay the tax and up to 35 percent more in penalties and interest one case was overturned on appeal none have been prosecuted criminally the california highway patrol also considers the process unlawful and has a cheater s hot line that encourages people to drop a dime on a neighbor if they see an rv with outofstate plates parked for a long time in the driveway dealers in other states tend to rebuke those from montana at industry gatherings we get pistolwhipped pretty badly because other dealers think we 're stealing their business , said denny anderson of gull boats and rv in missoula but john m bennett , a lawyer here who has created limited liability corporations for nine years , defends montana s approach as legitimate there s no fraud going on , he said there s a perception these are n't real companies but they are they meet the minimum requirements of montana law for outofstate buyers , mr bennett researches the laws of their home states to make sure they do everything they can to avoid a use tax when they return home californians , for example , must keep the vehicle out of state the first year avoiding taxes on such bigticket purchases is nothing new people have long taken delivery of expensive items in states with favorable tax laws many states insist that their residents still owe a sales or use tax , no matter where the item is shipped or bought , but tracking down such sales can be difficult in montana , mr bennett has created limited liability corporations for yachts , planes and luxury cars , though state laws typically make it harder to avoid the associated taxes and fees for motor coaches , many people used to travel to oregon , which also has no sales tax and low registration fees oregon has since made it more difficult for outofstate buyers and even helps other states track down people who go there to avoid taxes but in montana , the buyers' names are not disclosed , and limited liability corporation requirements are few it s legal , said brenda nordlund , assistant attorney general for the montana department of justice it s a policy choice we 've made and so the buyers come , to fly the montana flag of convenience mark bretz , president of bretz rv and marine , says up to a third of his business comes from outofstate buyers he often gives away a few free nights at local campgrounds while buyers wait for the paperwork , which can take a day or a week , depending on the complexity , and he sometimes pays for airline tickets mr bennett will not say how much of his business comes from such corporate setups , but allows it is substantial and can be done without even setting foot in montana montana s law is perfectly legal , said walter hellerstein , a law professor at the university of georgia and an expert on the state taxation of interstate commerce it s not fraud to play whatever games the law allows you , mr hellerstein said marcus lemonis , chairman and chief executive of freedomroads , which is based in illinois and has become the largest rv dealer in the country through a string of dealerships , does not agree he refuses to set up limited liability corporations for his clients , and his company hopes to change the montana law plenty of dealers around the country , in and out of montana , advocate this process , mr lemonis said but it seems wrong another complication for states seeking to recover taxes is the peripatetic nature of the nation these days many rv'ers , like the reids , are full timers who no longer have a stationary home the reids have a book called the next exit that describes activities off all the nation s interstates , and they plan to average 150 miles a day , at 6 to 10 miles on a gallon of gas , before someday buying a house in east texas becky and boyd baldwin , who lived for years in montana and recently bought a new coach at bretz rv , said montana license plates could be misleading when they parked at a campground in naples , fla , they noticed two rv s with plates from missoula on them i thought , 'great , montana people , ' mr baldwin said i went to introduce myself , and they had no interest whatever they were llc people 'we 're from new jersey , ' they said someone drove them out for us '
l'affaire cyberonics began a week ago tuesday that evening , cyberonics , a small houstonbased medical device maker , held an invitationonly educational program for psychiatrists the company was in the process of introducing its new product , an implantable device for people who suffer from treatmentresistant depression it was using the event , held simultaneously in 48 cities , to recruit psychiatrists to the cause just about everything about the new device , called the vns therapy system , is steeped in controversy \( vns stands for vagus nerve stimulator \) the data about its effectiveness is muddy the food and drug administration initially declined to approve it for commercial use , then changed its mind and signed off on it in july it is expensive about 15 , 000 and nobody knows whether health insurers will be willing to reimburse depression patients who want to try it or whether psychiatrists will support it for cyberonics , which has only one other product on the market \( a similar device for epilepsy sufferers \) , it is a huge roll of the dice if the vns therapy system fails in the marketplace , it will be a disaster for the company and its stock price that tuesday night , sept 27 , one of the securities analysts who follow cyberonics , alexander k arrow of lazard capital markets , decided to crash the event he wanted to gauge for himself the level of interest among psychiatrists , instead of relying on the company s word he hired college students to go to all the locations , and gave them a list of questions to ask the doctors he went to one of the sites as well , signing in as dr alexander arrow , lazard capital markets mr arrow , 34 , is indeed a medical doctor i should also mention that he put a sell rating on the stock back in june it was a very good call the stock has since dropped around 40 percent and closed yesterday at 2893 but the sell rating infuriated the company when cyberonics realized that its meeting had been infiltrated by dr arrow , it went bananas it tossed out the analyst and all the college students , threatening to call the police to at least one of the sites the next day , the company sent out a scathing email message to cyberonics investors , denouncing mr arrow , and asserting that he had personally attempted to gain unauthorized access to the event we are providing this information so that you can make a wellinformed decision regarding the research methods employed by lazard capital research , the email pointedly concluded and then printed mr arrow s office phone number the notsosubtle message was that cyberonics wanted investors to call the analyst and berate him for what he had done by the end of last week , most of wall street had seen the cyberonics email it was so loopy that traders and fund managers were sending it around to all their friends there were two general reactions the first was that mr arrow should be applauded finally , an analyst is doing primary research , one hedge fund manager said they were surprised that cyberronics was making such a big deal out of the incident how could drawing attention to its feud with an analyst possibly help the company or its share price \? the second reaction , though , came from investors and traders who were more familiar with cyberonics they were n't the least bit surprised their reaction , to paraphrase ronald reagan , was there he goes again ! the he in this case was the company s chief executive , robert p cummins , known to one and all as skip to put it mildly , mr cummins has a history of this sort of thing the modern ceo is supposed to be cool , calm and collected imperturbable in the face of criticism skip cummins is none of these thing mr cummins is , to put it bluntly , a hothead a 6'2 former dartmouth football player , he favors the shavedhead look , which gives him an intimidating mien that he uses to great effect he holds conference calls during which he berates short sellers , and complains about how cyberonics' supposed enemies are leaking information in order to hurt the company when the fda initially turned down the vns therapy system last august on the grounds that the data was inadequate he did n't hold back then , either , even though the agency has lifeordeath power over medical devices during that call , an investor asked him whether his inflammatory language might hurt cyberonics with the agency mr cummins replied that the fda s refusal to approve the vns therapy system was more inflammatory than any language i would use reporters \? last february , after the fda sent the company a socalled approvability letter in which it said was likely to change its mind and approve the device if cyberonics took certain steps mr cummins wrote an email message to a reporter at thestreetcom who had been critical of the company you 've only just begun to eat every word of the garbage you 've written over the last six months , he wrote james j cramer , the hedge fund manager turned television personality \( and founder of thestreetcom \) , told me that he thought the vns therapy system could be a big deal but , he said this company is run by the most combative , most antagonistic ceo in america he is deeply passionate , but he has inflamed a lot of people \( that s right jim cramer is complaining about someone else s overthetop personality \) more than anyone else , though , it is the analysts covering cyberonics who bear the brunt of mr cummins s wrath none of them would talk for the record about mr cummins s antics they did n't dare but they all had stories about cyberonics cutting off their access to the company after a downgrade of the stock and of mr cummins belittling them in private email messages and public conference calls they also talked about how he was n't the most reliable imparter of information about the company promotional was a word i heard more than once which perhaps helps explain why mr arrow decided he had to go to the september event and see it with his own eyes \( lazard s lawyers , alas , would not let mr arrow talk to me for this column \) indeed , most people i talked to said that mr cummins s personality has become a factor in the stock all else being equal , it is quite likely that cyberonics would have a higher stock price if its ceo were n't such a bully he is a polarizing figure , said thomas gunderson , an analyst for piper jaffrey , who has an outperform on the stock but the analysts realize something else that most of the rest of wall street misses all else is n't equal skip cummins , for all his flaws , is the primary reason cyberonics exists when he first stepped in as chief executive in 1995 he had been with a venture firm that financed the company it was in desperate straits he got its first epilepsy device through the fda , and accepted in the marketplace despite plenty of resistance and although it is impossible to know what he did to help change the fda s mind about the vns therapy system , it seems safe to say he left no stone unturned i think he probably just planted a tent at the fda and refused to go away until it reversed itself , said one analyst he was only half joking when i spoke to mr cummins , i quickly got a sense of both his passion and his bluster as he portrayed the situation , he and cyberonics were pioneers , bucking conventional wisdom to bring innovative devices to sick people for whom traditional medicines did n't work pioneering , he told me , is not for the faint of heart he described himself as changing the status quo in the face of all the interests , starting with the big pharmaceutical companies , that wanted to see cyberonics fall flat on its face it was almost as if he needed to believe he was surrounded by enemies it was how he motivated himself he then went on to sling a number of slanders at his latest enemy , mr arrow , including the accusation that the analyst had once secretly photographed propriety cyberonics data during a factory tour this does not appear to be true , but it hardly matters if the vns therapy system is going to be successful , mr cummins will need to lots of enemies , both real and imagined oh , and by the way three days after the cyberonics event , mr arrow put out a lengthy research note , reaffirming his sell rating the man has guts

darien , conn at a morning service on tuesday in st paul s church here , a worshiper read a poem urging his pastor to stand firm against the moral decay embodied by the local bishop and the church s national leadership fifty miles away in watertown , a pastor drew chuckles when he asked his flock to pray for the bishop , who has threatened to silence him for his defiance all told , six episcopal churches have rejected the authority of the bishop of the connecticut diocese and stopped paying their diocesan dues because of the bishop s liberal views on homosexuality and his support for a gay bishop in new hampshire the bishop , andrew d smith , has responded by threatening to remove the pastors of those congregations from their pulpits if they do not rejoin the fold by friday the rev christopher leighton , the rector of st paul s , says a reconciliation will not happen without supernatural intervention it would be a miracle , he said there s no doubt about it the ideological rift in connecticut is only the latest convulsion in a wave of rebellion shaking the episcopal church all across the country , fallout from the consecration of a gay episcopal bishop in new hampshire in 2003 and the church s softening stance on gay marriage in the last year , about a dozen churches have broken with the episcopal church usa , the american arm of anglicanism , and joined anglican dioceses in africa and south america whose leaders still view homosexuality as an abomination many other churches have split in two , or have joined networks of dissenting churches within the national church at the same time , the episcopal church usa faces growing opposition in the international anglican communion for its position on sexuality on wednesday , the american church s executive council decided not to send voting delegates to the annual world meeting of anglicans in june , obeying a request that the global council of the church had made to pacify angry anglican leaders in many countries the global leadership had asked the american church to send nonvoting delegates instead to explain the church s position on homosexuality , and the american church said on wednesday that it would do that voluntarily withdrawing an episcopal representative at this meeting , while it s a difficult thing to do , should be very warmly received , said the rev william l sachs , director of the episcopal church foundation , an independent group that follows trends in the church to address the american church s internal ferment , the global leaders , or primates , also called for the archbishop of canterbury , the church s worldwide head , to create a panel to hear disputes between american churches and their bishops but that panel has not been created yet this has left the six churches in connecticut with what they say is an unpalatable option reporting to an alternative bishop chosen by bishop smith no organization , including the episcopal church usa , keeps track of the number of parishes that split or leave because of theological differences with the mother church but in the last few weeks , members of an episcopal church in tempe , ariz , left to form their own church , the thirdlargest church in alabama split , and on sunday members of the biggest parish in the diocese of eastern kansas are expected to vote to quit the episcopal church usa ronald mccrary , the rector of the kansas church , christ episcopal in overland park , said , from my vantage point it seems like the pressure is building for congregations to act , and therefore the pace and frequency of parishes coming to a conclusion to separate from the episcopal church is picking up in connecticut , as elsewhere , discontent among conservative congregations over what they perceive to be the church s liberal drift both on matters of scripture and on social policy has been building for years father leighton said it crested in 2003 , with bishop smith s ordination of a gay priest , followed by his vote for the consecration of the gay bishop , v gene robinson of new hampshire last year , the six churches sought to be supervised by another bishop but they did not want bishop smith to choose that bishop in addition to father leighton of st paul s , the other priests and churches are allyn benedict of christ church watertown mark hansen of st john s church and donald helmandollar of trinity church in bristol ronald gauss of bishop seabury church in groton and gilbert wilkes of christ and the epiphany church in east haven the two sides spent months trading accusations of bad faith on march 29 , bishop smith notified the six rectors that they had abandoned the communion of this church , a canon offense punishable by removal and possible defrocking he told the priests that if they wanted to reconcile , they needed to do it by april 15 none of the rectors has responded , said leslie jones tollefson , a diocese spokeswoman st paul s is an airy place where prayer is led with acoustic guitars , the worshipers are all bornagain christians and a pamphlet subtitled exposing the 'gay' theology is stacked by the entrance last week , the church s lay leaders wrote bishop smith that they would not let father leighton meet with the bishop until the bishop had spelled out what the rector had done wrong the diocese s director for communication , karin hamilton , said that the dispute is clearly a matter of authority rather than a theological difference the priests , she said , take vows of obedience to their bishop in their ordination , and these priests are essentially not accepting the authority of the bishop father leighton would agree , at least , that the sticking point is an issue of obedience on tuesday , he preached on the apostles peter and john , who are forbidden by the religious rulers of israel to spread jesus s gospel and reply that they answer to god , not to the theocracy eventually , the bible says , many priests of israel became obedient to the faith of peter and john let s pray for that , father leighton told his flock let s pray that large numbers of priests become obedient to their faith
susette kelo s pink 19thcentury victorian cottage stands like a lighthouse against the oncoming storm ms kelo , 47 , was on the losing end of the supreme court case last month that allows the city to buy her home for private redevelopment on the day the court ruled , she sat in her favorite chair on her wraparound porch under a green umbrella and waved at neighbors passing by ms kelo is a deeply sympathetic character , a victim of a city that says it can make better use of her property but she is n't asking people to feel sorry for her it s their own backs they should be watching , she says this has nothing to do with me , she said i'm nothing i'm a nobody this is every us citizen , every american no homes , no properties , no farms nothing is safe anymore the supreme court s decision has indeed cleared the way for more condemnations in states such as connecticut that allow the government to take homes and businesses and replace them with more profitable private developments in connecticut , the law gives cities a broad array of reasons to condemn property , said jeremy paul , a professor at the university of connecticut school of law dana berliner , a lawyer with the institute for justice , which represented the plaintiffs in the new london case , wrote in one report that the state seems eager to use these kinds of condemnations at the same time , for a connecticut city to take someone s land it must go through a complicated process designed to guard against corruption and unnecessary displacement that , some say , keeps cities from using their powers to take property too loosely one of the things to understand is that the process is very extensive , mr paul said the supreme court ruling , mr paul added , does not open any new avenues to condemn a house it simply upholds the way the state has already used eminent domain the way courts have interpreted eminent domain laws has evolved over the last two centuries cities and states have taken private property through eminent domain laws since early in the nation s history , often to build roads or other pieces of public infrastructure that right is enshrined in the 5th amendment to the constitution , which says that states must give private property owners just compensation when they take their property for public use many courts followed that language narrowly that land taken from a private owner had to be used for the general public up through the middle of the 19th century , according to the supreme court opinion on the new london case written by justice john paul stevens toward the end of the 19th century , however , the courts began reading the fifth amendment more broadly , allowing public bodies to take land for private mines and mills more recently , cities have used eminent domain laws to clear out slums while some states have placed tight restrictions on taking private property for private redevelopment , connecticut has not the new london case raised questions about just how far the law could go the city may have fallen on hard times in recent years , with a declining population and tax base , but none of that was ms kelo s fault blighted is not a word anyone would use for her house , with its happy family photographs hung on the walls , its stainedglass chandelier in the dining room and cozy moccasins in a basket at the foot of the staircase ms kelo is a nurse , the kind of professional that many cities hope to attract why take her house , and the 14 other properties that were at issue in the case \? the court gave a handful of answers and its answers , lawyers said , help to clarify the boundaries of eminent domain laws those clarifications may make the process of condemning homes for private development easier in the future , because they show cities how to use their eminent domain powers , said wesley horton , the lawyer who argued new london s case before the supreme court obviously , new london provides a road plan for other municipalities , he said for one thing , the city is poor the city was declared a distressed municipality in 1990 and has had unemployment rates in recent years that were higher than the state average this taking occurred in the context of a comprehensive development plan meant to address a serious citywide depression , wrote justice anthony kennedy in a concurring opinion cities in better economic shape would be hardpressed to prove the need for condemnations , mr horton said it would raise eyebrows if greenwich claimed it needed to condemn property for economic redevelopment , he said it also helped that the city had undertaken a lengthy public process of hearings to present plans and gauge community support , the court noted the city has carefully formulated an economic development plan that it believes will provide appreciable benefits to the community , justice stevens wrote the court also addressed the idea that the ruling would open the door to cities that want to transfer property to a favored developer , perhaps someone with political connections that , the concurring justices said , would be an improper use of the law justice kennedy noted that the identity of most of the private beneficiaries were unknown at the time the city formulated its plans the justices who voted in favor of the city made it clear that courts should handle such condemnations on a casebycase basis but many are concerned that the court opened the door too wide to cities and landhungry developers the specter of condemnation hangs over all property , justice sandra day o'connor wrote in a dissenting opinion nothing is to prevent the state from replacing any motel 6 with a ritzcarlton , any home with a shopping mall , or any farm with a factory ms berliner said the court s decision paves the way for future condemnations benefiting private parties going through newspaper articles from 1998 to 2002 , she found 31 cases in connecticut of private homes' being condemned by governments for redevelopment by private parties the practice is on the rise , she said i think it s increasing because courts are n't putting a stop to it , she said in connecticut , statistics from the judicial branch indicate that the number of contested redevelopment condemnations has increased over the past decade in the fiscal year from 1989 to 1990 , the court system logged 11 new redevelopment condemnation cases ten years later , 146 were filed in the most recent fiscal year , from 2003 to 2004 , 84 cases were filed the majority of socalled redevelopment condemnations consist of cities condemning property to give to another private owner , as in the new london case , ms berliner said mr paul cautioned that that does n't necessarily mean that cities are becoming more zealous in their attempts to get land it could simply mean that property owners thought the law was vulnerable and decided to take more cases to court , he said it s very misleading to attempt to assess the number of condemnations by looking at the number of contested cases , he said as legal issues develop and as homeowners believe they have a better chance of winning a suit , they 're more likely to fight about it some argue that connecticut cities can be trusted with this power they use condemnation sparingly , and when they do it generally benefits the city s residents the connecticut conference of municipalities , which represents 143 towns and cities , submitted a brief to the supreme court supporting new london s case and pointing to the state s past success at using condemnation to improve the economy connecticut s laws allowing eminent domain for economic development had given rise to 62 projects , with 667 businesses employing 32 , 000 people through 1991 , the association wrote in its brief the brief also highlighted success stories , including projects in bridgeport and meriden that had produced hundreds of new jobs the rumors that now everyone s home is at risk is really a great exaggeration , said kevin maloney , an association spokesman but for some people who have been directly affected by condemnations , the process can seem arbitrary and deeply unfair frank bugryn jr s family , for instance , owned about 30 acres in bristol when the city told him in the mid1990 s that it wanted an industrial park on his property ms bugryn s parents had bought the property in 1939 and left it to him and his three siblings in 1970 , he said mr bugryn , 83 , a retired brassmill foreman , planted about 500 christmas trees on the property about 10 years ago and watched them grow 20 to 30 feet high when the government officials came knocking , they told him they wanted to put a distribution center on his property he was totally unprepared i never though that this would happen , he said mr bugryn fought the condemnation in court when he lost , the united states supreme court would hear the case the city paid 18 million for the property , and about 100 , 000 for the fivebedroom house mr bugryn built , and then bulldozed it , he said he now lives with his wife , mary , in a onestory ranch house in bristol my sisters and i were hoping to live there until we passed away , he said i wanted to die there and give it to the kids nothing has yet been built on the property jonathan rosenthal , executive director of the bristol redevelopment authority , said the legal battle with the bugryns delayed the project the anchor tenant , which had agreed to allow the bugryns to live on the property for the rest of their lives as the industrial park was built , dropped out of the project while the fight dragged on , mr rosenthal said the authority received a 12 million federal grant to prepare the property for development and has been showing it to potential tenants , he said mr rosenthal said bristol needed the property to give the city an economic boost we are a distressed city , mr rosenthal said like a lot of places , we need jobs and we need the tax base other eminent domain cases designed to spur redevelopment are pending in connecticut s courts in norwalk , peter morley , the president of maritime motors on west avenue , is fighting a city plan to redevelop the site of his business the city decided it wanted an office park in the neighborhood and needed mr morley s property to build a railroad underpass mr morley , who said he has fought the condemnation for more than four years , lost the case in superior court and state appellate court , but has since appealed to the state supreme court his lawyer is wesley horton , who represented the city in the new london case mr horton said the new london case will not likely affect the norwalk case because he has charged that the city s plan is improper , not that the law is unconstitutional both mr horton and mr morley said the city changed its plans for the site in the late 1990 s after mr morley had acquired the property in the old plan , they contend , the city had included space for a car dealership norwalk mayor alex knopp said the city had planned to redevelop that property since 1983 and mr morley should have known about the plans when he bought the property this was a terribly rundown and blighted area , and the city has focused on redevelopment for 25 years , he said unlike new london , there s no innocent owner surprised by the city s plans

an unusual alliance of corporations , nonprofit groups and universities plans to announce today an ambitious plan to digitize hundreds of thousands of books over the next several years and put them on the internet , with the full text accessible to anyone the effort is being led by yahoo , which appears to be taking direct aim at a similar project announced by its archrival , google , whose own program to create searchable digital copies of entire collections at leading research libraries has run into a series of challenges since it was announced nine months ago the new project , called the open content alliance , has the wideranging goal of digitizing historical works of fiction along with specialized technical papers in addition to yahoo , its members include the internet archive , the university of california , and the university of toronto , as well as the national archive in england and others the digitization of print materials has been a continual effort on the part of various research libraries for the last several years but the potential power of the new collaboration lies in the collective ability of many institutions to compare and crossreference materials , said daniel greenstein , librarian for the california digital library at the university of california this is the kind of platform we 've been looking for for a long time , said dr greenstein libraries digitize their stuff and put it up , but none of the libraries have comprehensive collections of everything now we can say 'we have this particular edition of mark twain , but it s not as good as that one over there , ' and we add it to the collection the library of congress , for instance , has one of the largest library collections in the world , but even that collection is incomplete it s all about gapfilling and collection development , said dr greenstein although the new project will not be a direct source of revenue of yahoo , it could give the company s search feature more visibility the announcement also establishes a new round in the battle between yahoo and google over index size the number of documents that can be found in a search engine s database yet the new project s approach differs from google s in several ways once a book has been digitized , yahoo will integrate the content into its index and provide an engine for the group s web site \( opencontentallianceorg \) as soon as it s made available on the oca web site , we 'll get a feed letting us know , so it can be indexed by us immediately , said david mandelbrot , vice president of search content at yahoo in a departure from google s approach , the open content alliance will also make the books accessible to any search engine , including google s \( under google s program , a digitized book would show up only through a google search \) and by focusing at first on works that are in the public domain such as thousands of volumes of early american fiction the group is sidestepping the tricky question of copyright violation last month , a group including the authors guild , which represents several thousand writers , filed a lawsuit against google the suit contends that the company s program , google print , is engaged in copyright infringement because although only text fragments are displayed , a book must be digitized in its entirety to make it searchable in august , google suspended until nov 1 its plan to scan copyrighted books , to give authors and other copyright holders the opportunity to opt out of the program google refused to give specifics , but said a number of copyright holders had opted out google has defended its practice , arguing that although a copyrighted work is scanned in its entirety , only snippets of text are shown in a search result , falling within the fair use provision of copyright law , which allows limited use of such material we believe what we 're doing is fully consistent with copyright law , said susan wojcicki , a vice president at google when it comes to copyrighted materials , the newly formed group appears to be taking a more cautious approach by seeking permission from copyright holders and by making works available though a creative commons license , whereby the copyright holder stipulates how a work can be used other projects talk about snippets , said brewster kahle , the founder of the internet archive , a nonprofit organization in san francisco that is building a vast digital library we do n't talk about snippets we talk about books dr greenstein said that the university of california , which plans to contribute as much as 500 , 000 to the project in the first year , will scan 5 , 000 volumes of early american fiction at the outset , with the eventual goal of scanning another 5 , 000 to 15 , 000 volumes within the next year the books will be drawn from the 33 million volumes contained in the university s 10 libraries but dr greenstein said he planned to be selective we are n't planning to march through and scan everything we have , he said our approach is very collectionfocused , to seed meaningful collections and get other libraries around the world to do the same yahoo did not disclose the overall budget for the project , although its own contribution has been estimated at between 300 , 000 and 500 , 000 for the first year hewlettpackard and adobe systems are contributing equipment to the project , and the internet archive will do the actual digitizing and archiving of the books the internet archive has set up shop at the university of toronto and has scanned some 2 , 000 volumes at a cost of about 10 cents a page what s so interesting about all of this are the collections that can come forward that are relatively specialized , said carole moore , chief librarian at the university of toronto this will put it together on a global scale , which is really exciting richard terdiman , a professor of literature at the university of california , santa cruz , said the creative commons approach appeared less likely to antagonize copyright holders until the supreme court decides what is fair use and is the google model acceptable , they wo n't have to spend threequarters of their time fighting lawsuits in the meantime , there is no shortage of public domain materials whole chunks of libraries are out of copyright , said dr greenstein , who estimated that some 15 percent of most university library collections no longer have such restrictions peter givler , the executive director of the association of american university presses , who has been an outspoken critic of the google project , was also more sanguine about the open content alliance they want to start working with publishers from the getgo , said mr givler and i certainly like the idea that their index will be searchable by other search engines the new group is calling for others to join and mr kahle of the internet archive said he hoped to recruit google the thing i want to have happen out of all this is have google join in , he said i know we 're dealing with archcompetitors , but if there s room for these guys to bend , by the time my kid goes to college , we could have a library system that is just astonishing
you know that it s a slow news week when two local television stations send cameras to a council meeting in the tiny essex county town of glen ridge to cover an even tinier change in the town s signage ordinance the earthshaking news \? real estate agents will no longer be able to slap under contract signs over the for sale signs on residents' lawns to show off their selling prowess sold signs have already been disallowed the new ordinance , which carries a fine up to 100 a day , merely slams shut a loophole glen ridge is particularly persnickety about signs contractors' signs that advertise painting , paving , kitchens and other improvements common in other towns are forbidden yard sale signs posted on trees or poles will be promptly removed by none other than mayor carl bergmanson you just ca n't beat that personal touch when it comes to law enforcement open house signs erected on the strip of grass between the sidewalk and the street also must come down much to the bitter disappointment of the town s mutts there s a sign in my car right now that was on town property , mr bergmanson said every town has its own little culture we take great pride in the way our streets look and the way our houses look as for the mayor himself , he has a sign on his house that says , attention chat lunatique \( or attention crazy cat \) , which , at 3 inches by 6 inches , is apparently well within the limits of the law if it said chat lunatique vendu , however , that would be another story debra galant
berlin during the german band rammstein s 1998 american debut tour , the lead singer , till lindemann , whipped out a monstrous black appliance in his performance of b ck dich \( bend over \) and employed it to simulate sex with his keyboardist , who lay on the floor with a mask on his face , a chain around his neck and a gag in his mouth when they tried this in worcester , mass , the two men spent the night in jail on obscenity charges this is nothing compared with the uproar they have caused in germany , where people actually understand their lyrics their pyromaniacal stage shows and songs about mass graves , white flesh , screaming mothers and the eroticism of power have made the band members infamous , as much for their neofascist aesthetic as for their assiduous denials that their music has anything to do with what it very much seems to be about whatever the case , the band , six grown men from the former east germany now touring europe for the first time in two and a half years , is the secondmost popular \( after kraftwerk \) in german history hours before rammstein played the berlin velodrome , on dec 19 , thousands of fans crowded the entrance , despite the bitter cold we find it funny how germany talks about the band , said a berlin woman in her late 30 s , staking out her place at the front of the line in germany they 're in a lot of trouble but that s because rammstein is misunderstood people think they 're evil and racist they do n't get the irony some of rammstein s fans had arrived in jeans and anoraks others had come in leather , and one had shown up on a dog leash the crowd was of all ages , from children to an elderly man in a tweed jacket many fans were wearing tshirts with the legend you are what you eat , a reference to rammstein s recent hit about the german cannibal armin meiwes , who in 2002 shared a final meal with his willing victim of the man s severed , flamb ed penis the cold seemed to dampen the crowd s energy the fans only once burst into into the traditional skinhead chant oi ! oi ! oi ! we love rammstein because they make it so hard , so dark , so evil , and that makes it so interesting for us , said another woman in her late 30 s when i told her i was about to interview the band members , she lit up she asked me to tell mr lindemann that his face was tattooed on her body the tattoo was , she said , in a special place i would have told him , but when i ran into him several minutes later , in the corridor backstage , he scowled i do n't speak , he said , nein , and stomped off this colossal former swimming champion looked bloated and unwell he had deep circles under his eyes his dark stagemakeup was smeared the band s second guitarist , paul landers , who was holding court in a small office backstage , was more forthcoming at first , yes , we thought it was our duty to provoke germany , he said , to get germany going in a certain direction that was at first but then we realized , it does n't work that way it takes time what we can do is set a certain example we can show the way blaze a trail that trail , he explained , was toward healthy german selfesteem before , it was deutschland ber alles germany above everything , he said and now germany is below everything rock bottom our problem is that we actually think germany is pretty good but almost nobody thinks that everybody s very embarrassed to be german in the early 1990 s , when rammstein burst onto the scene , resurgent german nationalism had given rise to an efflorescence of politically strident faschorock bands rammstein s innovation was to look and sound very much like faschorock while denying any political opinions at all rammstein s music , said its publicist , has no political content whatsoever their songs are about love rammstein s lyrics and imagery were just close enough to the line a line no mainstream artist in germany would dare to cross to arouse very uneasy emotions , but just far enough that their game could be plausibly denied and the critics dismissed as humorless hysterics perhaps more important , rammstein was also a terrific group of musicians although the band sang only in german , it set sales records in the rest of europe , and even managed to intrigue americans \( among them , unfortunately , the boys who opened fire at columbine high \) the men are enormously popular in russia , too according to authorities there , the organizers of the beslan massacre were rammstein fans as well rammstein s commercial success opened the door for pop music in the german language and inspired scores of imitators but the neue deutsche h rte the new german hardness was , of course , anything but new antidiscrimination groups were appalled critics were none too pleased , either the neue deutsche h rte , wrote the music journalist martin b sser , is playing with fire in many ways , and at the same time is trying to shirk any political responsibility the band and the fans counter with one simple question why should guilt over the events of a previous century prevent germans from enjoying heavy metal along with the rest of the world \? with the release last september of the album reise reise , rammstein for the first time took an explicit political stance the song was amerika , an exercise in gardenvariety european antiamericanism reise reise immediately became the bestselling album in europe i was told by one fan a 36yearold berlin restaurateur who has known the members of the band since they were all boys together that rammstein s antiwar position proved their harmlessness the members of rammstein report themselves puzzled and wounded by the controversy over their music so , too , with the uproar over their use of a clip from olympische spiele a leni riefenstahl documentary commissioned by the nazis in 1936 as a song of praise to the ideals of national socialism in one of their videos they had , they said , used it only because it was so pretty you know , it s funny , said richard kruspebernstein , the band s founder and lead guitarist , before the berlin show i was reading yesterday about 50 reviews of the last shows , in germany and not one of them was any good not one person , not one writer , not one journalist likes the show \? i mean , come on there s something weird there i do n't know i think germany still has a big problem with us i ca n't really figure it out you know , it s almost like a man who would never admit he likes to go to a bordello or something but he still goes the band s handler came in to tell me that my time was up , and hustled me toward the wings of the auditorium , where stagehands were preparing the explosives the evening s schedule , taped to the wall , could have doubled as a battle plan for the song du hast \( you hate \) there would be gas lyco comets grid rockets mortar hits , and for the encores there would be airbursts , flames , and the ominoussounding concussion boat at precisely 8 pm , exilia , the warmup act , began , and the audience suffered it politely then the group left the stage , and a man beside me pulled out a pack of cigarettes and ripped off some filters to stuff in his ears reise reise , now the no 1 german single , began with the sound of lonely waves and seagulls , an ominous warlike pounding , the primitive chanting of sailors on a galley according to the band s official translation , the title means voyage voyage but it can also be translated as arise arise , and that is how the audience took it a huge curtain dropped , revealing a row of massive potemkin amplifiers that flashed with the band s insignia , something like a swastika the guitarists descended from the ceiling like gods , and the audience was steamrollered by smashing drums , violent bass and the sound of a full choir , amplified to unspeakable levels the auditory assault was not , however , merely loud it was thrilling rammstein is popular for a reason its rhythmic craftsmanship , its eerily hypnotic chords , its command of musical tension and release make much american heavy metal seem childish and anemic most compelling is its lead singer dressed in an imperial german military uniform , mr lindemann gave off an air of such brute masculinity and barely contained violence that it seemed that he could have reached into the crowd , snatched up a fan , and bitten off his head he commands a low , powerful bass rarely used in contemporary pop music , untrained but electrifying the audience members , enthralled , began pumping their fists in the air the band then introduced one of its most notorious songs , links , with the sound of metrically precise , marching jackboots links means left , and the band claims this song is an expression of its leftwing sensibilities the jackboots were followed by a furious chorus linkszwodreivier ! linkszwodreivier ! \( lefttwothreefour ! lefttwothreefour ! \) the german language lent itself to the powerful , rhythmic song the keyboardist stomped about in a german military helmet mr lindemann performed an exaggerated goose step the crowd shouted hi ! in unison , which sounded just different enough from heil that the resemblance could be denied the musicians , wearing flamethrowing gas masks , sprayed fire over the stage they burst explosives in the air and shot balls of flames over the audience , generating heat so intense that fans began to pass out medics strapped the fallen germans to gurneys and carted them away as for the survivors , it would not have been hard to direct their furious energy toward a target when , later , the band sang amerika , it seemed quite clear what the target of preference would be i emerged from the concert profoundly relieved that the members of rammstein declare themselves to be against war if this is their pacifism , the mind boggles at what their aggression might look like reise reise has been released in the united states whatever the group thinks about america , rammstein plans to tour it at the end of this year , again bringing its music of brutal ambiguity to its large number of american fans music correction january 23 , 2005 , sunday an article on jan 9 about the german band rammstein referred incompletely to the english translation of the song title du hast while the band translates it as you hate when it performs the song in english , a literal translation would be you have \( the german for you hate is du hasst \) the article also referred incorrectly to the sales ranking of the song reise reise while the album named for the song reached no 1 in european sales , the song itself has not been released as a single

the field across from our neighborhood elementary school was always a little scruffy , the grass patchy in places , the bleachers and fence rudimentary but the locals appreciated it anyway neighbors with lawn chairs spent summer afternoons there , tanning and reading the weekend paper children drifted by for pickup ballgames dogs could chase frisbees without plowing into the street the lack of overhanging trees and wires made the field a perfect site for kite launchings , too but last year , and please pardon my sounding like a joni mitchell song , the bulldozers arrived the montclair board of education turned the field , not into a parking lot , but into an upgraded athletic facility , an expanse of vivid synthetic turf with permanent field markings , a big scoreboard , a new fence and a padlock the 70 or so high school girls who play field hockey can use it , and so can other high school teams , as well as organized sports leagues and camps that carry liability insurance the rest of us are unwelcome i know some neighbors were unhappy about this my husband grumbled that the fence , 10 feet tall , looked more appropriate for a maximum security prison a couple across the street disliked all the officialness we did n't mind the kids romping around out there , the husband said now it s practically an olympic stadium down the block , my neighbor christine used to take her twins to the field to play but the last time they walked over , carefully skirting the edge of the fake turf to sit in the new bleachers and take in a lacrosse practice , some guy a coach \? a parent \? christine was n't sure objected he said 'what are you doing here \? you ca n't be here go away she said i did n't argue i went away interestingly , none of us protested to anyone official we can see how celebrated jock culture has become in suburban towns , where the desire for healthy minds and bodies mingles with the obsession over healthy college applications we did n't have to tune into that summer show on the bravo cable network , sports kids moms dads , to witness consuming commitment to athletics we just had to look around so it seemed futile to protest that , somehow , humans managed to play games on real grass and dirt for centuries if artificial turf has n't invaded your town yet , it probably will soon it s been increasing every year , says boyd sands , executive director of the new jersey state interscholastic athletic association , making it sound like a plague it s moving through central jersey and heading south west essex and livingston and east orange have synthetic fields toms river has three rutgers stadium has swapped its grass for a surface called fieldturf and , because synthetics get hot , installed an accompanying irrigation system watering fake grass ! this is a great country but fake fields are more vulnerable than they look , apparently they can be damaged , the local school business administrator , dana sullivan , tells me soda gum they 're flammable so we lock them , and unfortunately that does cut down on their use by the public but the board felt we needed to protect the investment when the investment hits 653 , 000 , as this one did , you can see her point it seems a bit churlish to complain , anyway do n't we want high school kids to have fine new fields that are easier to maintain , stand up to multiseason use and give field hockey balls a truer bounce \? the benefits of athletic participation are extensively documented , especially for girls i suppose it s a happy development , therefore , that in the past decade the number of kids playing high school sports in new jersey is up nearly 20 percent among boys , and more than 37 percent among girls all those scholarathletes have to practice someplace in fact , the girls' varsity field hockey team that plays on what was once our neighborhood field won the league championship last fall , and then the state sectionals go , mounties ! but while the players and their parents shoulder a lot of the direct costs of sports the shoes and equipment , the lessons and camps , the hours spent shuttling players to practices and games the rest of us also make sacrifices , and not simply in our role as taxpayers we 've lost the easier pace of a time when late afternoons and weekends could be unstructured , when recreation could be spur of the moment , when everything did n't always have to be so terribly organized we 've lost a community where kicking a ball around does n't require filling in paperwork and carrying insurance to reserve a slot on thursday afternoon week after next we 've lost a communal backyard with scrubby , but genuine , plant life we 've lost our field drawing \( drawing by nancy doniger \)
beverly hills , calif it was early november , and john cooper was in his office here , staring as if hypnotized at a bulletin board over the next few weeks , the board , which was covered in colorcoded cards bearing the names of movies , would coalesce into the slate for the 2006 sundance film festival hundreds of filmmakers , agents , producers , acquisitions people and financiers would have dearly loved to get a look at that board not that it would have done them any good even at that late stage in the process , the list was far from set by next week , half of those titles might be gone , said mr cooper , the festival s director of programming , with an air of utter exhaustion others that had not even been considered yet were still to emerge but somehow or other , he knew that they would be winnowed down to a final list of 120 pictures in time for the scheduled release last week mr cooper was n't working all by himself , of course he collaborates with geoffrey gilmore , the festival s director for the past 16 years , and three other programmers , trevor groth , shari frilot and caroline libresco but even so , the task is overwhelming this year , those five people combed through 1 , 004 american and 936 international features \( up from last year s 761 and 843 , respectively \) and 760 american and 448 international documentaries \( up from 624 and 385 \) then there were the shorts 4 , 311 of them \( 3 , 887 last year \) it is all anyone can do just to get through them mr cooper said he had watched seven films the previous day mr groth had been watching films 14 hours a day for two months mr gilmore says that over the course of a year he watches between 800 and 1 , 000 films you become very emotionally elastic if you watch as many films as we do , said ms libresco , a filmmaker and fiveyear veteran of sundance who coordinates the world cinema section i find that right now i'm totally sociopathic i ca n't talk to my friends with so many images coming in , i 've been wanting someone to do dreamtype analysis on geoff gilmore s brain or shari frilot s brain the festival has become so famous it is practically synonymous with independent film , but until now , the process by which films are selected has remained a mystery within the industry in a rare discussion of the festival s inner workings , the programmers said they were suffering not only from the sheer volume of images cascading into their heads , but the pressure of discriminating among them added to that are the expectations of the media , the public and the independent film industry , a field that has both influenced what mainstream hollywood makes and in some ways supplanted it by dint of his position and his temperament , mr gilmore , 54 , is probably the one who takes those burdens most to heart under his stewardship , the festival run by the sundance institute , which robert redford founded has become an international institution yet the director is , by his own admission , a worrier , and the inevitable carping that accompanies an enterprise of this scope drives him crazy mr cooper , a 17year sundance veteran who tends to fly above the fray , likes to joke that the staff takes a scissors to the hollywood trade publications before mr gilmore has a chance to see them among things that might be censored film critics who find the festival too commercial acquisitions people who say it is too arty journalists who offer snap judgments that they later do not amend or correct suggestions that some power brokers , especially the sales agent john sloss , get preferred treatment from mr gilmore this last complaint , which has very little support among independent film executives , is probably the most damaging to the festival even mr sloss distances himself from it , sort of i do n't discourage people from thinking that , he joked recently but geoff keeps his own counsel he will tell me if he likes a film , but not whether it s in the festival when the selections are finally unveiled , he wants to get a bigger bang for his buck , and i do n't blame him , mr sloss added i suppose it makes me sound too selfrighteous to say that integrity is a huge part of sundance s success , mr gilmore said during a september interview at the toronto international film festival , where he was scouting foreign films because if we do n't have integrity , if we do n't program what we think we should program , not what people are advocating us to program , we do n't become the festival we 've become because everybody is trying to influence you , everybody is trying to ask you for a favor , everybody is trying to tell you why you will bankrupt them if you do n't play this film that s pretty tough , especially when it s a friend one of the things i learned is that there is very little value in showing films that do n't work that means brushing aside , say , a plea by the actor samuel l jackson , who called the director s home to lobby on behalf of a film , or the urgings of harvey weinstein , first at miramax and now at the weinstein company of course , there is still a subjective element to deciding what works , mr gilmore acknowledges just not as much as one might think one of the biggest distinctions that i make to my staff is that it s not simply about what you like , it s about what you should play , he said i think trying to be a professional programmer is not being subjective a lot of people think that good programmers have a kind of narrow refined taste , some sort of peak of aesthetic comprehension whereas to me really good programmers are very receptive to a lot of different things to find what is new , the staff casts a wide net , attending international festivals both to see what is being screened and to hear about what is in the works on rare occasions , they will consider and admit a film before the submissions process officially begins , but that is risky because it may not measure up to the films sent in later \( submissions officially close on sept 30 , though they can drag on until the beginning of november the festival is set for jan 19 to 29 in park city , utah \) this year mr gilmore saw early cuts of julian goldberger s hawk is dying , which is in this year s dramatic competition , but that is the exception not the rule the staff will also listen to people whose opinions they trust and who are not simply pursuing their own interest mr cooper said he would also take calls from industry veterans and cineastes like the producers christine vachon , jonathan king and ted hope \( who is an executive producer of the hawk is dying \) or , on the executive side , sony pictures classics' tom bernard , picturehouse s bob berney and the former united artists chief bingham ray agents are a waste of time , mr cooper said , because they are selling a client and often have not seen the film in question but none of these outside voices , programmers said , get a vote instead , what drives the process is the machine , as mr cooper likes to call it and the machine is driven by the sheer volume of films , and when they are submitted the process then is necessarily nonlinear and freeform every film is seen in its entirety by at least one person , often more sundance employs more than a dozen people to go through the features , and then to write a report that rates them on a scale from 1 to 5 \( mr gilmore says he tries to get these screeners to distinguish between the weird and the bad \) in fact , programmers will even review a few of the films rated 1 or 2 , just to make sure nothing has been overlooked and once the debate about the lineup begins in earnest , a complicated dynamic comes into play mrgilmore said he was not looking for a consensus but passion from his programmers if a film gets somebody excited , it is worth considering , even if others disagree discussions take place in mr gilmore s office , where , amid a jumble of chairs , pizza and diet cokes , he moves film titles around mr cooper s bulletin board like chess pieces these meetings occur twice a week for the last month of the process , often lasting three or four hours each time , and increase in intensity and frequency as the hours and options dwindle they are described by mr gilmore as spirited and cerebral , but not bitter sometimes these involve different combinations of programmers , although all sit down together when making a final decision at the end there is no raising of hands mr gilmore makes the final decision before that decision is made , mr cooper said , his colleagues keep one another grounded when they become too enamored of a film he will often give a movie about which he has misgivings to a colleague who he thinks will like it , just so they can argue about it a film that prompted a lot of debate , for instance , was neil labute s in the company of men \( 1997 \) some who saw it thought it was merely sexist others said it explored sexism this year , a film that has story elements outrageous enough to make them nervous they declined to discuss specifics is stay , directed by bobcat goldthwait \( and not to be confused with marc forster s recent film of the same title \) the key , all say , is to keep an open mind , which means overcoming the urge to be critical of films that are often flawed i remember my first year being part of the programming process , said mr groth , who joined sundance in 1989 and handles the shorts program i 'd come to the meetings , and my opinion was there were flaws in everything geoff said , 'i do n't disagree with what you 're saying , but to do this you first look for the good in every film you watch' in a lot of ways it makes it seem like not such a colossal waste of time watching all of these films especially since many of the films are in less than perfect shape frequently they are too long , especially the documentaries mr gilmore said he almost always asks is this the final cut \? if it is not , the busy programmers might ask about proposed changes , or give a filmmaker an extension occasionally they accept a film that is not quite finished , only to have the director end up making it worse the debates do not end with the selections there is also the issue of where to place each film the most coveted categories are the highprofile competitions best american documentary and dramatic , world cinema documentary and dramatic in each , 16 films fight for a grand jury prize , an audience award , and , in the case of the american films , prizes for best direction , cinematography , editing \( in the documentary category \) and screenwriting \( in the dramatic field \) but the programmers sometimes decide to keep promising films out of those categories , lest they get overpowered by more intense critical scrutiny or overheated speculation sometimes a film is excluded from competition because the playing field is tilted the other way the film is too big for example , on the feature side , nicole holofcener s friends with money , which mr gilmore described as one of the best independent films i 've seen in years , is being presented as the openingnight film , rather than part of a competition that is because , he says , ms holofcener is a known quantity , having also directed the film lovely and amazing , and the movie has stars like jennifer aniston it already has a distribution deal with sony pictures classics in the documentary section , debates raged this year over whether or not some of the subject matter was old news mr gilmore and mr cooper championed chris paine s ev confidential who killed the electric car , which castigates corporations that value profit over sound environmental policy this was a big so what \? to some of the staff but mr gilmore and mr cooper thought the film important enough to include , and it will now appear in the spectrum section , a noncompetitive category that represents an array of domestic and foreign dramatic features and documentaries at the same time , ms frilot persuaded the pair to include in the competition ian inaba s american blackout , about the disenfranchisement of africanamericans during the 2000 election , another subject that seemed more important than timely closer to the news , the festival this year has been inundated by films about iraq programmers picked one for world cinema , heidi specogna s short life of jose antonio gutierrez , and two for the american category , james longley s iraq in fragments and patricia foulkrod s the ground truth after the killing ends to counterprogram against these and other seriousminded documentaries , they selected patrick creadon s wordplay , about the new york times crossword puzzle and its editor , will shortz , as an entry in the competition they could just as easily have played shari cookson s all aboard ! rosie s family cruise , about gay family life but instead , that film was put in spectrum clearly , of the two , wordplay is more in need of the exposure that comes with the competition , since all aboard ! has both rosie o 'donnell and hbo behind it but the decision was made less than a week before the slate was announced , so fluid is the lineup those who select the films acknowledge that they have not always made the right choices mr cooper said the festival had mistakenly passed on greg mottola s daytrippers \( 1996 \) and jeffrey blitz s spellbound \( 2002 \) one of his biggest regrets was dismissing carl franklin s muchadmired sleeper hit one false move \( 1992 \) mr gilmore agreed about this last , saying that he bowed to the objections of a programmer instead of going with his instincts for all the anxiety over what goes into the festival , oddly enough , the final lineup is not what concerns mr gilmore and mr cooper the most the two said they could live with the system they have created and the inevitability of passing on an occasional hit i never really care if we missed a film and it found its place , mr cooper said my biggest fear is that a film that i 've never heard of makes it somewhere else selections from the sundance lineup at the end of a long process , 120 films were selected for the 2006 sundance film festival the dramatic feature competition category includes these films , listed with their directors a guide to recognizing your saints , dito montiel come early morning , joey lauren adams flannel pajamas , jeff lipsky forgiven , paul fitzgerald half nelson , ryan fleck the hawk is dying , julian goldberger in between days , so yong kim

san antonio , june 12 manu gin bili began the game with a 3pointer , shot like a flare into the texas sky , and the spurs never trailed again as they started streaking toward victory , and perhaps a place in nba history , the spurs left the pistons unraveling on the court , melting along with their championship memories exasperated , outworked and outclassed , these pistons did not resemble the champions of last season as much as they did their dysfunctional opponent from 2004 , the lakers nearing the end of an uphill game , pistons coach larry brown finally lost his cool after yelling about foul calls so did chauncey billups , the pistons' point guard , and each was whistled for a technical foul with 3 minutes 54 seconds to play and the spurs holding an 18point lead it was as if the pistons , bewildered and befuddled , threw up their hands soon enough , the spurs raised theirs with a thoroughly dominating 9776 victory in game 2 of the nba finals it put them two victories from winning their third championship in seven years if we were in their situation right now , gin bili said , we would be very upset the next three games will be at the palace of auburn hills , and the pistons will have to win at least two detroit won three straight there last year to beat the lakers in five games , but only 2 of 26 teams have rebounded from a 20 series deficit to win a title brown , who declined to talk about the team s technicals , was unsure if a change of site would make a difference i hope so , he said but right now , the way they 're playing and the way they 're executing , the contribution they 're getting from a lot of people , they just dominated two ball games with tim duncan in the middle , and gin bili everywhere on the court , the spurs made the little plays on both ends against a pistons team that suddenly seemed to remember it was in the nba finals too late the spurs led by as many as 23 points in the third quarter when the pistons rallied to within 8 points , gin bili and company made the difference with six minutes to play , gin bili stole the ball and saved it into duncan s hands while falling out of bounds on the sideline bruce bowen then hit his fourth 3pointer of the night , essentially closing the door on detroit i understand that i'm the anchor of the d , bowen said but they feed off of me it s contagious bowen hit 4 of the spurs' 11 3pointers on a night when the team had 24 attempts from beyond the arc the spurs were exceptionally efficient , scoring on 29 field goals and 28 of 34 free throws gin bili finished as the high scorer for the second straight game , with 27 points , and had 7 assists we were just moving the ball so well early , said duncan , who had 18 points and 11 rebounds when we 're playing on that level and hitting shots like that , we 're really tough to beat the pistons , the secondbest defensive team in the league this season , behind the spurs , had no answer to stop the spurs' insideoutside versatility last year in the finals , the lakers never scored more than 45 points in a half against the pistons on sunday , the spurs scored 58 by halftime we got back in the game with effort , brown said but every time we did , they had an answer hopefully with our crowd , we can get out in the beginning , throw the first punch and be aggressive i think we have gotten frustrated and went on our own a little bit too much i think defensively we 've been real soft the pistons left texas demoralized , not knowing if they would return for game 6 the pistons shot only six 3pointers and made none they took just 16 free throws and made 10 i thought we got a little frustrated , billups said every time we made a run , every time we showed we were trying to get back into the game , they made a huge play whether it was a steal or a 3 , they did it when you get into a groove like that , it seems like you get all those kinds of little breaks with gin bili perfect from everywhere on the floor in the first quarter and adding 5 assists , with duncan nearly perfect from the paint , and with parker dashing through the lane , the usually solid help defense of the pistons did not know where to turn the pistons could not find an offensive rhythm , hampered again by tayshaun prince s foul trouble , as the spurs forced them into shooting 364 percent in the first quarter detroit attempted just one 3pointer in the first half and while the guards were able to get the ball inside to rasheed wallace something they did not do in game 1 it was at the expense of the backcourt richard hamilton finished 5 of 15 from the field , unable to deal with the defensive pressure from bowen , but he also missed open shots for the second straight game he finished with 14 points antonio mcdyess , off the bench , led the team with 15 robert horry gave the spurs an immediate lift in the first half known as a clutch shooter , he had three steals in the backcourt in the first half alone , the last steal off a pistons inbounds pass with 167 seconds remaining in the half he dove on the floor , wresting the ball from billups horry called timeout , gin bili got the ball and drove the lane , drawing the foul he knocked down free throws to give the spurs a 5842 lead going into the locker room we had a great game but i do n't think it has been easy , gin bili said game 3 is going to be so tough , with their crowd they will play tough defensively we just got to be patient
washington , feb 25 the justice department inspector general said friday that dozens of subcontractors hired in 2003 to help iraq rebuild its prison system did not undergo thorough background checks into allegations of misconduct by some of them at american prisons however , the report concluded that none of their backgrounds would have disqualified them from working in iraq and that none of them had any involvement in the abuses at abu ghraib prison in baghdad the report , which was made public on friday , was prompted by a request for an investigation last june from senator charles e schumer , democrat of new york he raised concerns that several of the men who had been hired were unqualified because of allegations of serious misconduct in lawsuits when they served as ranking officials in the prison systems of their states mr schumer asked that the inspector general , glenn a fine , review the screening process and explain why some background information might have been disregarded when these individuals were appointed while the lawsuits ended in settlements or administrative findings of no fault , none resulted in findings of misconduct , the report said , describing many of the suits as standard complaints filed by inmates against correctional officials mr fine said in the report that the hiring agency , the international criminal investigative training assistance program , was unaware of the allegations , but that even if officials had known of them , the charges would not have been judged serious enough to bar the men from being hired the report said that inadequacies in background checks should be addressed with a series of new procedures the report includes 11 recommendations for change , including the use of a database that provides information on civil court cases , as well as criminal records of applicants to work in the program mr schumer said he was not entirely satisfied by the report s findings it s very disturbing that the justice department would select subcontractors with checkered pasts to bring 'order' back to iraq s prison system , he said in a statement the only silver lining in this awful incident is that the justice department is finally taking real steps to ensure that the guards and administrators we give to iraq s prison system will help them , not make things worse mr schumer s initial complaint focused on four consultants hired because of their expertise in running prisons lane mccotter , who had been a state prison director in texas , new mexico and utah terry stewart , who had worked in the arizona prison system for 17 years gary deland , who had headed the salt lake county and later utah prison systems and john armstrong , who retired in 2003 as commissioner of the connecticut department of corrections the report said initial background checks found references to controversies and lawsuits involving each , but the information was insufficient to raise any serious concerns further investigations , prompted by mr schumer s letter , generated more information , but still nothing that would have prevented their hiring , the report said as for any links to the abuses at abu ghraib , the report said the subcontractors had either left iraq before the abuses occurred or they did not supervise military personnel stationed at the prison who were accused of abusing prisoners
tehran , june 16 an unusual campaign season for iran wound down thursday , one that was defined by a field of candidates who all emphasized moderate platforms aimed at reforming the system and yet was also marred by extraordinary violence there were 12 bombings in the days before iran s presidential election , killing more than 10 people and wounding dozens more a campaign office was set on fire , seriously injuring at least one volunteer people were beaten while campaigning and posters were torn down , and on thursday , the day before voters were to go to the polls , the departing president warned of a dirty tricks campaign aimed at undermining the race president mohammad khatami said in a letter quoted by the official news media , it seems there is an organized movement to hurt the glorious process of the elections without identifying who was behind that movement , mr khatami said in the letter that he was referring to the disruption of gatherings , beatings , illegal pamphlets and spreading lies to ruin candidates' reputations regardless of political inclination iranians are accustomed to their share of political violence , with clashes between riot police and demonstrators a nearly routine part of this country s discourse but the explosions , which have taken place across the country , have raised concerns that political extremists have escalated their tactics some of the conservatives , who control the allpowerful religious arms of the government , have accused the united states of sending in proxy mercenaries to suppress voter turnout and embarrass the islamicbased government but a rising chorus of reformers have blamed extremist conservative forces for the violence polls show that the conservativebacked candidates are not expected to do well in the elections on friday , and that they may not even make it into a runoff election , if one is required we have never had security issues in the country before the elections , said saeed laylaz , a political analyst and journalist who has written for several reformist newspapers we must see who is losing the game in the last minute it seems that somebody does not like what will happen on friday leaving little doubt who he suspected was responsible , he added , the conservatives have lost the game the bombings have also underscored the tensions that rest just beneath the surface here , where anxiety and fear exist side by side with the images of a democratic election process protesters were beaten by batonwielding riot police on thursday for chanting antigovernment slogans while seated in a public park a witness said the protesters had been chanting about freedom when the riot police roared up on motorcycles and on foot and charged the crowd the witness was a security guard at a shop across the street who looked out the door to see what was happening and was also beaten the police came and beat people indiscriminately , said the man , who did not give his name for fear of reprisal there are seven candidates in the race for president an eighth withdrew wednesday and the frontrunner is considered to be ali akhbar hashemi rafsanjani , a former twoterm president who has run as a moderate pragmatist dr mostafa moin , a reform candidate who was initially barred from the race by religious conservatives , has surged and may have moved into second place , political commentators say none of the candidates are expected to draw more than 50 percent of the vote , the amount needed to win outright , so the contest is expected to be decided in a runoff scheduled for the following week supporters of dr moin say the violence around the country increased as their candidate s prospects improved it is all politically motivated , said issa saharkhiz , an adviser to dr moin , in an interview at his campaign headquarters the situation changed when the polls showed dr moin in second place , and that the conservatives will not go to the second round many reformminded voters , those who turned out in record numbers to elect mr khatami in 1997 and again in 2001 , had been expected to boycott this election , opening a door for conservative candidates but late in the race , dr moin s candidacy suddenly became credible , and his opponents began to fear that those who had been considering a boycott would instead come out to vote the theory among some of dr moin s supporters is that the explosions were aimed at keeping those voters home dr moin s campaign was further unnerved on thursday by a fire it said had been set in a campaign office in the small town of hormoz , near the persian gulf , seriously injuring a volunteer saeed shariati , a reporter with the newspaper iqbal , which supports dr moin , said he had confirmed reports that party officials had said they were sure it was arson the interior minister , abdolvahed mousavi lari , said in a news conference on wednesday that the bombings were not all directly linked and that only the first blasts , in ahvaz , near the iraqi border , were carried out by a professional terrorist group that had contact with people overseas he said there had been some arrests made in that case and that more were expected he did not give any more details as for the rest of the explosions , he said , investigators have concluded there was a political element involved though he did not say who was responsible correction june 18 , 2005 , saturday because of an editing error , an article yesterday about the atmosphere in iran as its presidential campaign ended misstated the location of a fire in a campaign office for a reform candidate , dr mostafa moin it was in the town of khormoj , not hormoz

until very recently , joseph phelps vineyards was a midsize california producer that operated with little glory napa valley oldtimers like beaulieu vineyards , stag s leap wine cellars , heitz wine cellars and robert mondavi got the credit for establishing napa cabernets as worldclass wines , while newcomers like colgin , harlan estate and screaming eagle turned cabernet into a cult , with bottles going for hundreds of dollars apiece phelps , a quiet pioneer , turned out wines that were consistently good and often excellent established in 1972 , joseph phelps vineyards was an early proponent of rhonestyle wines in california le mistral , its southern rhone blend , remains one of america s best phelps was also a leader in producing vineyarddesignated cabernets , like its backus vineyard wine and especially its eisele vineyard wine phelps s flagship wine has been insignia , one of the earliest bordeaux blends to receive a proprietary designation nowadays it s easy to reel off names like dominus and maya , but insignia was there first but it was only in the last month that phelps insignia came to be seen as exalted , when wine spectator magazine selected the 2002 insignia as its wine of the year such an honor comes at a price insignia fans who previously could count on obtaining the wine rather easily are now chasing down stray bottles at 150 apiece , even though insignia is produced in quantity 15 , 000 cases of the 2002 the dining section s wine panel had long planned to taste a dozen vintages of insignia to find out how it compared with other established california cabernets like monte bello , shafer hillside select , stag s leap s top bottles , chateau montelena , beringer vineyards private reserve and perhaps a few others indeed , frank j prial , florence fabricant and i , joined by tim kopec , wine director at veritas , a restaurant in the flatiron district , were highly impressed by the bottles we tasted , covering 12 vintages from 1978 to 2002 i felt the wines were remarkably consistent in quality and style two bottles even earned four stars , our highest score and one we rarely award many napa cabernets , even at the highest level , are made in a very different way than they were 20 or 25 years ago growers plant new clones of grapes on different rootstocks , which can change the flavors and intensity , and they harvest lower yields , which can further concentrate the wine they allow grapes to ripen longer , producing sweeter , more alcoholic wines yet , even though the more recent vintages we tasted showed a tendency toward the bigger fruitbomb style that is so popular today , they still retained the insignia signature of balance , restraint and harmony in terms of alcohol level , the wines were consistent , too through 2001 , the wines we tasted ranged from a low of 133 percent in 1986 to 14 percent in 1999 only the 2002 rose above that , and , at 144 percent , it would most likely be on the low side of most top napa cabernets as good as the insignias were , tim voiced a significant reservation i do n't view them as thoroughbreds , he said there s consistency of winemaking , but not of origin he meant that unlike some top wines , the insignia wines do not come from the same vineyard year after year they lack personality traits derived from the specific site on which the grapes are grown , because the grapes come from a variety of vineyards , some owned by phelps and some not , and the formula has changed from year to year phelps has recognized this issue the 2004 insignia will be produced entirely from phelpsowned vineyards in oakville and the stag s leap district , the winemaker , craig williams , told me in november we need to begin to define exactly where insignia is from , he said nonetheless , like wines that come from great terroirs , the 12 insignias we tasted reflected the qualities of particular vintages , living up to outstanding ones while outperforming bad ones how else to explain the 2000 insignia , one of our favorites , even though the 2000 vintage was regarded as mediocre \?

london , dec 19 more than two years after beginning an ambitious push into investment banking , hsbc is still struggling to win work as an adviser on big deals that is , except in the middle east , where a flood of petrodollars and hsbc s long history in the region have helped the bank win several deals last week , hsbc served as the sole adviser to dubai international capital in its 12 billion purchase of the doncasters group , the scottish engineering company the bank also advised on the dubai group s 15 billion purchase of the tussauds group , the wax museum chain , earlier this year and it was the lead adviser on the recent initial public offering of dana gas , in the united arab emirates , that raised 560 million those deals , said hsbc s investment banking chief executive , john j studzinski , are a sign that the bank s growth strategy is working one of the things that i said early on is that we 'll use our emerging markets platform to advance investment banking , he said that s where we have a competitive local advantage hsbc has operations in 22 middle east countries the bank s business there dates back to 1889 , when one hsbc founder obtained a banking license from the shah of persia and started the imperial bank of persia in contrast , citigroup s presence in the middle east dates back to the 1950 s in pursuit of those petrodollars , many financial institutions have increased their focus in the middle east morgan stanley announced plans to open its first office in the region in november , for example obviously , it s an important market , said guy de blonay , a fund manager with new star asset management there s a lot of cash being generated from the high oil price , and this money needs to be invested hsbc has a dominant position in the middle east among global banks , he said despite its longstanding presence , hsbc is still far from being the leading bank rothschild was the top adviser on middle east deals \( excluding israel \) through monday , according to thomson financial hsbc ranked 14th , up from 19th last year but hsbc s connections do seem to be landing it access last month , the saudi arabia government gave hsbc an investment banking license , which the local capital market authority said was the first ever awarded to a foreign bank saudi arabia is expected to earn about 150 billion from oil sales this year and the government has pledged to diversify the economy the us investment banks have not been there in the same way , and that s where hsbc can add a bit of value , said michael helsby , an analyst with foxpitt kelton in london globally , however , hsbc still has a long road ahead while this year is shaping up to be the busiest year in mergers and acquisitions since 2000 , hsbc continues to lag behind its rivals through the third quarter of this year , hsbc did not rank in the top 25 advisers on completed united states deals , and was no 20 in europe , down from 15th a year ago , according to thomson financial there have been some gains in some areas of equity and debt , for example , hsbc is making inroads still , mr studzinski acknowledges that more work needs to be done in certain parts of the world , particularly north america , the brand name is not associated with equity and corporate advisory business , he said hsbc has about 100 bankers in north america in 2003 it had none mr studzinski said it would take time to build the investment banking business in europe and north america , noting that it took rivals like deutsche bank and ubs several years and numerous acquisitions to be accepted as investment banking names this is a build from scratch , he said give me another two and a half years , and i think we 'll be very credible the question is whether mr studzinski , who was hired to build the business , has another two and half years hsbc is in the process of a change at the top , with stephen k green taking over from sir john bond mr green , who becomes chairman in may , helped orchestrate the current investment banking growth strategy but he was also responsible for the bank s last big push into investment in 2001 , an effort that was abandoned after the bank paid no bonuses to some in the division , causing many bankers to quit mr green is not expected to make any radical changes at hsbc in the short term , analysts said mr studzinski said he was convinced of a commitment to investment banking , at least in the near future stephen green is the architect of the strategy , mr studzinski said he s committed to it as of now , he said , adding whether he s committed to it in five years' time , we do n't know
dubai , united arab emirates , feb 3 saudi and egyptian reformers bristled thursday at president bush s call in his state of the union address for greater reform in their countries , dismissing the speech as patronizing and unproductive the government of saudi arabia can demonstrate its leadership in the region by expanding the role of its people in determining their future , president bush said and the great and proud nation of egypt , which showed the way toward peace in the middle east , can now show the way toward democracy in the middle east mr bush also singled out iran and syria for supporting terrorism , even as he called for a free palestinian state reformers in saudi arabia planning for the country s first elections said his statements would undermine their credibility this kind of talk is always frustrating , said a saudi commentator , khalid alfarm , head of the arab media association and an independent observer for next week s elections in essence he s saying the same thing we are , but all he s doing is putting the government and the reformers in a tight position we certainly know the need for reform here and are working for it , said dr khalil khalil , a professor at the imam muhammad bin saud islamic university who is widely regarded as a saudi moderate dr khalil dismissed the call as pandering to domestic politics it seems we know america very well , but america does not know us well it needs to understand us better in order to find its appropriate role when it pushes these kinds of issues saudi arabia s elections on feb 10 will be the first in the kingdom s history though modest in scope , the polls are widely being sold as a coup for saudi reformers but questions still remain over their legitimacy only half the council seats will be chosen by voters , and so far women have not been allowed to participate registration turnout , too , has been tepid and candidates are barred from campaigning on radio or television or in mosques none belong to any party in egypt , political reformers echoed saudi frustration with the speech , noting that they have been making the same demands for the past 25 years these blunt american statements exert a kind of political and psychological pressure that backfires within segments of the egyptian population because it makes the sincere demands of egyptian activists and politicians seem like mere echoes of the american stand , said dr hassan abou taleb , editor in chief of the arab strategic report published by the ahram center for political and strategic studies these are all intrinsic egyptian demands that have been around for more than 25 years , not merely an echo of american calls in the past two years , dr taleb said
moscow , july 27 the united nations on wednesday began relocating hundreds of uzbek refugees who had sought sanctuary in kyrgyzstan , moving them from a camp near the uzbek border to the kyrgyz capital , from which they are expected to be airlifted out of the country soon we are hoping to take all of the refugees out of the country on the humanitarian flight scheduled for 2 am friday , said carlos zaccagnini , the chief of the united nations high commissioner for refugees' mission in kyrgyzstan the refugees , survivors of the lethal crackdown on may 13 in the uzbek city of andijon , have been a source of diplomatic tension for months as uzbekistan , a country that practices torture , put pressure on kyrgyzstan for their return their ultimate destination is not clear speaking by telephone from the united nations offices in geneva , astrid van genderen stort , the spokeswoman for the high commissioner , said the refugees would be flown to a third country , where they would be processed for resettlement elsewhere she declined to say what nations might take them in , explaining that the governments that were involved in negotiations had asked that they not be publicly identified until the discussions were completed a kyrgyz customs official at manas international airport , outside the capital , bishkek , said the boeing 747 scheduled to fly the refugees from the country on friday was bound for romania a spokeswoman for the romanian interior ministry , reached by telephone in bucharest , said romania was among the nations considering accepting the refugees , at least for processing , but added that no decision had been made signs of the tension with uzbekistan reemerged wednesday as uzbeks in two vehicles crossed the kyrgyz border , proceeded to a detention center in the southern kyrgyz city of osh and demanded the return of at least 12 refugees who uzbekistan contends are fugitives they were among 29 who have been held in the center pending investigation and processing of their refugee applications uzbekistan has insisted that they were involved in crimes in the brief and violently suppressed uprising in andijon in may ms van genderen stort said that the kyrgyz government had assured the united nations that none of the refugees would be turned over to the uzbek government , but that concerns remained we have raised this with the highest levels of the kyrgyz authorities , she said at this point we can only be confident that they will do what they told us in june the kyrgyz government handed over four refugees to the uzbeks , prompting international outcry that the government had violated the 1951 refugee convention the fate of the four men is unclear the number of refugees who will leave the region is also uncertain mr zaccagnini said he expected 451 to depart , while ms van genderen stort put the number at 455 the fate of three refugees whom the uzbeks have accused of killing a prosecutor during the uprising in andijon , and of a man accused of drug crimes , appears to be the issue involved more than 300 refugees were moved from the border region to manas on wednesday , mr zaccagnini said they clustered at a building on the airfield in the evening and said they were cheered to be heading to a safer place , even if they did not know their ultimate destination it has n't been said yet , said one of them , anvar mavlanov , 35 they will tell us just before we get on the plane , they said it is for our safety too on monday , during a visit by defense secretary donald h rumsfeld , the kyrgyz government announced that the pentagon could continue using the manas air base , adjacent to the international airport , to support its operations in afghanistan that represented a shift in tone from a statement issued on july 5 by russia , china , uzbekistan , tajikistan , kazakhstan and kyrgyzstan , which sought to have the united states set a timetable to withdraw its military presence from central asia mr rumsfeld said the question of the uzbek refugees had come up during his visit there , but he gave no indication that he had nudged along any resolution we had a good discussion about it , he said wednesday in a brief interview aboard his airplane en route home from iraq but he said the planning for the airlift had already been in the works between the united states ambassador in kyrgyzstan , the state department and the united nations
the white house is making a wellpublicized shift in its marketing of harriet miers , president bush s nominee for the supreme court from now on , the talk is to be about her qualifications rather than her heart , her character or , especially , her religion it s none too soon the president s attempt to sell his choice on the basis of her evangelical faith has been offensive mr bush is all in favor of judges strictly interpreting the constitution , but he seems to have forgotten about article vi that s where the founders decreed that no religious test shall ever be required as a qualification to any office the bush administration has been using religion as code , to communicate reassurance to the right that ms miers will be opposed to abortion and gay rights , and to dodge legitimate questions about her legal philosophy and qualifications as a result , the american people have no idea whether ms miers thinks there is a constitutional right to privacy or where she stands on the extent of federal powers , but they do know that she was born a roman catholic and became an evangelical christian they know that she was a longtime member of the valley view christian church , and that she was one of a small number of worshipers who joined its minister , ron key , in breaking away and forming the cornerstone christian church because of a disagreement over styles of worship when ms miers came under fire from conservatives , president bush told reporters that people ask me why i picked harriet miers , and then proceeded to talk about the importance of religion in her life james dobson , the founder of focus on the family , a conservative christian group , told a radio audience that he had been assured by karl rove , president bush s top political adviser , that ms miers is a member of a very conservative church , which is almost universally prolife it is shocking to think that this is the way americans discuss a supreme court nomination in 2005 in the 1960 election , john f kennedy struck an important blow for both the separation of church and state and the rights of people of all faiths to be considered for high office when he insisted that his catholicism should have no bearing on his fitness for the presidency the bush administration seems intent on turning back the clock the white house is invoking ms miers s religious activities as a substitute for talking about her professional qualifications and her views about the law , which remain a mystery but her qualifications and beliefs about the law are what matter as this nomination proceeds , both the nation and ms miers will benefit if we hear less about what kind of a christian she is , and more about what kind of a justice she would be
lusby , md , june 22 george w bush on wednesday made the first presidential visit to a nuclear plant in 26 years , and declared , it is time for this country to start building nuclear power plants again mr bush laid out steps that he said the government should take to help none of those proposals were new , but his venue was an office building next to the twinunit calvert cliffs nuclear plant here , about 50 miles southeast of the white house mr bush offered his thanks to those who showed him around , especially controlroom technicians , for being so gracious and kind and taking time to explain all the dials and gauges i can play like i understand what i saw , he said , drawing chuckles from an enthusiastic crowd of about 300 , including state and local officials , executives of nuclear power organizations and plant workers the president s 45minute speech touched on other elements that the white house groups under the heading of economic security , including his proposals on social security , asbestos litigation , medical malpractice , education and foreign trade but nuclear power was the focus , more than three decades after the industry last ordered a nuclear plant whose construction was not subsequently canceled the last president to visit a nuclear plant was jimmy carter , who went to three mile island in pennsylvania on april 1 , 1979 , the fifth day of the major accident there urging calm , mr carter , a veteran of the nuclear navy , wore disposable booties that day because of contamination on the floors on wednesday , mr bush wore a hard hat but ordinary clothes the areas he visited the control room and the turbine hall , where steam is converted into mechanical energy and then electricity are normally clean among those in the audience for mr bush s speech was nils j diaz , chairman of the nuclear regulatory commission , who said , the memories people have are jimmy carter intervening in a moment of crisis , whereas mr bush is intervening in something he believes is very important to the country the president emphasized a proposal he made in april for governmentfinanced risk insurance to help reassure investors in new nuclear plants that they would not be hurt if lawsuits or government delays held up a project leaning over a lectern as if to make a confidential point , he said , you do n't want to go out and build a plant , spend all the money and have the license jerked at the last minute mr bush said that since the united states stopped ordering reactors , france had built 56 of them china , he said , is working on 8 he contrasted oil , whose consumption in the united states grows even as the nation s production of it declines , with an energy source that he called completely domestic , though in fact the business of designing new reactors , and making fuel for existing ones , is now mostly globalized any aid for the nuclear industry faces stiff opposition jim riccio , an energy expert at greenpeace , said that despite much talk that nuclear power was becoming economically viable , reactors were still onethird too expensive to be competitive brent blackwelder , president of friends of the earth , said subsidies for new reactors would soak up all the money that should go into solar or wind power , or into efficiency investments as the president toured the plant here , back in washington senators continued work on a broad energy bill a day after adopting a provision asking companies to voluntarily reduce the emissions that scientists blame for global warming , the senate voted 60 to 38 to defeat an amendment that would have imposed mandatory limits the amendment , sponsored by senators john mccain , republican of arizona , and joseph i lieberman , democrat of connecticut , would have capped carbon emissions by 2010 at levels that prevailed in 2000 the senate then adopted a resolution , sponsored by senator jeff bingaman , democrat of new mexico , expressing support for future mandatory limits the senate also agreed to give washington clear authority to override states' objections to the location of liquefied natural gas terminals by 52 to 45 , it rejected an amendment that would have allowed governors to veto federal permits for such terminals because of state concerns about safety or environmental harm advocates of the proposal said states should have a greater say because of the possibility of terrorism or tanker spills we 're not talking about the siting of a neighborhood ballpark or a walmart , said senator olympia j snowe , republican of maine it s a states' rights issue , plain and simple but opponents said that deciding where to put the terminals was a federal matter , because imports would help meet a growing demand for natural gas a vote on the entire energy bill is expected by the end of the week the house has already passed its own version
jerusalem , aug 6 the bush administration has increased pressure on the israeli government in recent days to do more to make a palestinian gaza successful after israeli settlers are pulled out later this month , according to american , israeli and international officials secretary of state condoleezza rice has put her influence behind the two american coordinators of the withdrawal james d wolfensohn , who is dealing with economic and civilian matters , and lt gen william e ward , who is helping to reform palestinian security services just how much the israelis will move on the complicated balance between security and economics , as mr wolfensohn describes it , will become clearer on sunday , as the israeli cabinet begins a series of crucial meetings on gaza ms rice is also trying to bolster mahmoud abbas , the president she sent a senior adviser , james wilkinson , on a quiet visit last week to ramallah , palestinian officials said he and a small team worked with mr abbas to reorganize his office to improve efficiency and accountability , so orders will be followed mr wilkinson also urged mr abbas to set up a press office and a protocol office , to try to improve his image and authority in interviews , both mr wolfensohn and general ward praised the support they were getting from president bush and ms rice , who have emphasized that a successful transition in gaza is vital to progress toward a viable , democratic , independent palestinian state the big thing is their personal commitment , especially from the president and secretary rice , to an orderly and peaceful withdrawal , and then to work toward a permanent peace based on a twostate solution , mr wolfensohn said both men stress the importance of economic development and freedom of movement to give palestinians the sense of a better future one mr abbas can hope to take credit for , in his political struggle with the militant islamic movement hamas israeli officials , who agreed to speak only on background , acknowledge the new pressure from washington to resolve questions of palestinian life in gaza access , assets , security , travel and the import and export of goods and people ms rice in particular has been forceful and even abrupt in her dealings with senior israeli officials , including the foreign and defense ministers , silvan shalom and shaul mofaz on her recent trip here , she ran the meetings with them in their offices , taking control of the agenda and even announcing when they would end , the israeli officials said she has also expressed impatience with continuing israeli requests for millions of dollars to help build modern passenger and goods terminals between gaza and israel , which the bush administration contends is in israel s interest in any case washington also rejected a request from israel to help pay for the destruction of the settlers' houses while the issue of where the rubble from the houses will go remains unsettled , the palestinians have agreed to use much of it to build a seaport , while israel has agreed to accept hazardous material for disposal ms rice was initially considering a return trip to israel next week to monitor the gaza pullout , but has since decided against it she 'll get credit if it works , and she does n't want to be here if it does n't , one american official in the region said in washington , a senior american official said that american involvement had increased sharply after ms rice , in june , told reporters she wanted to avoid mediating the details of gaza coordination but since then her aides have been doing precisely that our engagement has increased and it s likely to be sustained , the official said general ward said that israeli and palestinian military officials , down to the field level , were meeting to coordinate the pullout , to try to ensure that the israelis will not come under fire if there are mortar or rocket attacks , the israelis say they will stop the pullout long enough to ensure that the firing stops that could mean a major israeli military action that could badly undermine mr abbas general ward , a careful man , confirmed that two weeks ago , american pressure helped stay the israeli military when it was poised to go into gaza after a suicide bombing and rocket and mortar attacks that killed six civilians he predicted that there could be similar pressure should the need arise that scenario is a scenario that none of us would like to see , he said there is a deep realization on the part of the israeli leadership , including the military , about the consequences of that type of scenario mr wolfensohn is concentrating hardest on the movement of goods and people he has been trying , along with the united states agency for international development , to find a way to buy the remaining greenhouses from israeli settlers to preserve palestinian jobs , create new ones and maintain export markets but the palestinians have refused to allow american aid earmarked for them to be used to pay the israeli settlers , even for greenhouses for palestinians efforts continue to find private donors but more than half the greenhouses are already dismantled or destroyed , and it may be easier to find foreign aid to rebuild on the crucial issue of border crossings , israel and egypt are near a deal to station 750 egyptian troops along the border between egypt and gaza , which would allow israeli soldiers to leave the european union has offered to replace israeli customs and security agents at the rafah terminal there israelis would not be secure without the army israel objects to european supervision of palestinian and egyptian customs and security officials , but may finally agree if rafah is used only for the crossing of individuals , whose details would be passed to israel by computer for approval , and their luggage such agreement would have great symbolic importance for gazans and their freedom of movement , given that no israeli officials would be present , and washington supports it trucks and other goods would cross after inspection at another existing terminal in israel at nitzana , south of gaza there has also been progress at karni , the main goods terminal for israel and the west bank delays have been reduced , corruption has been attacked on both sides of the border , and the purchase of more sophisticated scanners has been agreed , if not the financing , said deputy prime minister shimon peres
tehran , saturday , june 18 for the first time since the islamic revolution in 1979 , iran will have a runoff election to choose a president after voters on friday failed to give any one of the seven candidates in the race the 50 percent of the vote needed to win , an interior ministry spokesman announced early saturday voting ended at 11 pm friday after polls were kept open an additional four hours to accommodate a late surge in voting that drove the turnout close to the 68 percent recorded in the last presidential election , interior ministry officials said with 12 million votes counted , nearly 40 percent of the expected total , the choice seemed to be coming down to two of four candidates ali akbar hashemi rafsanjani , the former twoterm president who ran as a moderate mehdi karroubi , the former speaker of the parliament and a moderate , reformist cleric dr mostafa moin , a former minister and member of parliament who ran as a reformer and mahmoud ahmadinejad , tehran s ultraconservative mayor , who until voting ended did not appear among the frontrunners in local opinion polls paper ballots , stuffed into large cardboard boxes at polling places , were to be counted through the night and officials said they expected to have more complete results later saturday morning the runoff would be held as early as next friday the results came after a day in which this country s leadership sounded more concerned about voter turnout than about who might actually win the race the religious leaders had feared a boycott of the polls , which they felt might undermine the credibility of the system , but by late friday it was evident that the turnout was relatively strong no matter for which one of these seven candidates we vote , in fact we are voting for the regime and the constitution , these two things , supreme leader ayatollah khamenei said after casting his own ballot that is why people take part in the election throughout the day , the nation s leadership did all it could to coax and cajole people into casting their ballots people are feeling responsible to vote , said ehsan alikhani , an anchor on staterun channel 3 in comments broadcast around the nation they feel the enemies are looking very closely at our country the foreign media has been saying turnout will be very low in remarks given during friday prayer , broadcast around the nation , voters were also told of their obligation to vote massive turnout by people in the ninth presidential election indicates that neocolonialism and global arrogance are now being confronted with a great and noble nation , said ayatollah mohammad emami kashani with seven candidates in the race , and none taking a commanding lead in the opinion polls , few were willing to make any predictions earlier in the day zahra eshraghi , 41 , granddaughter of ayatollah ruhollah khomeini and an active supporter of dr moin , seemed to enjoy the uncertainty around the outcome of the race she said it demonstrated how the public had managed to take control away from the nation s leadership the government was the one fooling the people and now the people are the ones fooling the government , said mrs eshraghi , an outspoken proponent of the reform movement the government announced this week that there were 467 million eligible voters , an estimated 35 percent to 40 percent under 30 iranians can vote when they are 15 the seven candidates an eighth dropped out this week geared their campaigns toward younger voters , offering hope of greater social freedoms , more civil liberties and a better economy with less unemployment hoping to look youthful , one candidate took off his glasses and posed for campaign pictures wearing colored contact lenses mr rafsanjani , a midlevel cleric , took the previously unthinkable step of appearing in public without his turban on even mr ahmadinejad , the mayor of tehran known for his ultraconservative views , attempted to moderate his tone in a speech reported in the iranian press , he said , islam without justice is not islam the campaigns may have focused on improving the quality of life in iran , but the nation has also experienced a rash of 12 bombings in the final days of the race the government said many of the bombings were intended to stop people from going to the polls , while reformers said they were meant to scare away their supporters two more bombs were found and defused , the iranian student news agency reported friday on the streets of this city on friday , voters seemed most concerned about whether to vote or to defy the leadership by staying home the conflict was evident at polling places in both the wealthy northern neighborhood of tehran , where people live in wellappointed homes behind iron gates , and in the gritty neighborhoods of the south who s going to listen to what i have to say , fatahen ahmadzadeh , 34 , said as she walked by a polling place in the southern portion of tehran we have to choose between bad and worse as sahar ghassemi , 25 , started to enter a polling place at a school in southern tehran , a young man , mohammed , who would not give his last name , shouted , i am not voting i will keep my fingers clean he said he was angry about the slow pace of change in the country i 've applied for a job , he said they asked me about religion what kind of country is this \? ms ghassemi turned on her heels you are making a big mistake , she said you are doing what the conservatives want you could not be making them happier the scene was played out in different ways around the city on africa street , a quiet treelined street in the north , sepideh saidi , 23 , and her boyfriend were walking together out of a mosque where ballots were being collected she had voted he had not like other people who did not vote , her boyfriend , hamed , did not want to give his full name , fearing he would get in trouble i could n't convince him , and he could n't convince me , ms saidi said it is a real democracy here each person has his point of view
capcom s action adventure game killer7 deserves a warning label on the front of the box that says caution may cause head to explode with its offkilter camera angles , convoluted story , odd premise and surreal imagery , this game is sometimes an overwhelming sensory experience as killer7 begins , a man walks into a building , looks at a security camera and turns into a different person soon he meets a transparent man in a red bondage outfit who speaks in metallic sounding , subtitled gibberish , refers to him as master and says , we 're in a tight spot the building is filled with giggling monsters that explode when they get near you feeling a wee bit confused , i checked the game manual and learned that killer7 is about a group of assassins hired to battle terrorists whose army is made up of oncehuman creatures who have somehow been driven mad and turned into time bombs none of that makes much sense , but killer7 is n't about making sense , it s about being cool with striking celshaded graphics and a bloodsoaked , utterly incomprehensible story , the game crams together elements from graphic novels , anime and quentin tarentino films the game s control system is almost as quirky as its presentation you do n't wander the environments freely but instead move along a set path by pushing a button , occasionally reaching junctions at which you can choose to turn a corner or look at an object monsters announce their presence with a maniacal laugh , at which point you pull a trigger to go into firstperson mode to shoot them each monster has one weak spot that if hit will evaporate them into a blood mist , but if your aim is n't that good you can just keep blasting away until they fall you control members of killer7 \( all surnamed smith \) , switching from one to another at will mask de smith is an exwrestler who carries a grenade launcher and can take a lot of damage , while kaede smith wears a bloodsplattered miniskirt and carries a sniper rifle sometimes you must use a specific assassin to bypass an obstacle coyote smith can pick locks while kevin smith can bypass security systems garcian smith is able to revive fallen assassins , although this is perhaps the worst design decision of the game when someone dies you have to move them to a safe spot and revive them , then travel back to where your character was killed , a tedious process that screams bad idea at first killer7 is a lot of fun stylish and well designed , you can hone your shooting skills while enjoying the flashy graphics occasionally there are entertaining scenes of killer7 s wheelchair bound leader , harmon smith , interacting with his dominatrix nurse but at a certain point it all stops being fun , not because the game changes , but because it does n't after five or six hours of gameplay killer7 goes from stylish and clever to mindnumbing , and reading bondagesuit guy s subtitles while listening to annoying gibberish , solving the game s simple , repetitive puzzles and blasting away at an endless supply of monsters becomes a grind bizarre imagery and disorienting concepts are great in small doses the 17minute luis bu uel film un chien andalou , for example , is as cool now as it was in 1929 , but i would n't want to see it expanded to several hours it is likely to take at least 15 hours to finish killer7 , and the game uses every idea it has in the first hour the game s designers seem oblivious to the necessity for variety the 1967 surrealist television series the prisoner always kept the viewer off balance with unexplained phenomena and elliptical dialogue , but it had a strong theme that it cleverly explored in its 17 episodes killer7 just throws weird stuff at you to little purpose like the story , the gameplay also fails to surprise you underneath the quirky control scheme , killer7 is a horrorsurvival game along the lines of resident evil and silent hill , and the level design is vastly inferior to both it s a shame no one makes threehour games , because killer7 would make a great one if you want to see a game push beyond the conventions of game narrative , then killer7 is worth renting but prepare yourself to be consecutively thrilled , confused , provoked , annoyed and bored senseless while killer7 is desperate to blow the player away with its weirdness and originality , makai kingdom chronicles of the sacred tome , a strategy roleplaying game by nippon ichi software , is content with a visual style and presentation in keeping with games made 10 years ago the game begins as the powerful , handsome overlord zetta loses his netherworld and his body , surviving only by moving his soul into the sacred tome that predicted this disaster for the rest of the game , zetta is a talking , disgruntled book who in a series of amusing vignettes is teased mercilessly by his overlord peers , a motley collection that includes a giant whale and a redeyed oracle with a valley girl accent the concept is as surreal as anything in killer7 , but makai is less ostentatiously weird and more a typical videogame example of japanese goofiness his realm gone , the overlords give zetta a new one but amuse themselves by filling his new land with monsters zetta must build an army soldier by soldier and go to war against increasingly hostile opponents building up power is the thrust of the game with no limbs , zetta cannot fight , but he can use mana energy acquired in battle to create new soldiers from common objects like flowers and anthills , and the game offers an increasing selection of warrior types and vehicles as you progress zetta enters each battlefield alone , then summons his army to join him he can drop soldiers on the field one at a time or call in a hut or hospital filled with warriors ready to jump out soldiers can actually pick up these dwellings and toss them into the midst of the enemy sometimes , like dorothy in oz , zetta can drop a dwelling directly on an opponent visually the game is typical of the genre , with small soldiers , wizards and sillylooking creatures battling on a terrain of cliffs and pastures makai is notable for a wide variety of entertaining attack animations one combatant armed with a time bomb will play catch with an opponent until it goes off , while another attack hurls enemies into the air , where they explode into the shape of the little dipper makai s gameplay is deep and fairly complex soldiers have different strengths and weaknesses against various warrior types and have expertise with different weapons this information is laid out in great statistical detail in the game interface along with information on each soldier s attack and defense capabilities , resistance to magic and other useful statistics statisticscentric games have never been my strong point , and while the game does a good job of presenting pertinent information clearly and simply i found all the numbers a bit daunting as i scanned numbers indicating

at last , investors seem to be awakening to the idea that not all mergers are in their best interests given that the current merger mania shows no sign of abating , this epiphany is a mighty good thing while most investors greet takeovers with open arms , the fact is that few can be sure that the deals are being struck at the best possible price given that the only assessment of a deal s fairness is given by investment banks that are paid when the deal is done , investors are right to wonder whether they could have benefited if their company s negotiators had been tougher now , some investors are doing more than just wondering whether these deals are fair they are concluding that they are not , and are voting against them last month , for example , almost 30 percent of the shareholders in transkaryotic therapies , a biotech company , voted against its proposed acquisition by shire pharmaceuticals , a british drug company only 526 percent of the eligible shares were voted in favor of the merger , an unusually small majority investors objected to that acquisition because of its price after the deal was struck in april , transkaryotic reported promising data from an important drug trial this drove up the company s stock , making the acquisition price seem unreasonably low and at least one large shareholder of the providian financial corporation has said that he will oppose that company s acquisition by washington mutual of seattle in the deal , announced in june , wamu , as it is known , has agreed to pay providian holders about 64 billion , or approximately 19 a share the price is only 8 percent above the level at which providian , the big creditcard concern , was trading when the deal was announced that is far below the 28 percent premium that bank of america said it would pay for mbna , another creditcard issuer shareholders will vote on the providian merger on aug 31 david l king , a portfolio manager at putnam investments , which holds 75 percent of providian s shares , says the price agreed to by the company is far too low we have very strong and wellconsidered opinions about what this company is worth , and 19 is not the answer , said mr king , who oversees the putnam new value fund there are scores of banks domestically and overseas who could buy providian at a higher price let s find out who might be interested rather than selling the company at a price that is inadequate providian s business is turning around , mr king asserted if you look at the latest quarter , he said , its default rates have come down to single digits , which is normal , and credit quality is clearly on an uptick he reckoned that the company was set to earn roughly 2 a share this year it baffles me why we should sell out at a price that is less than 10 times that , he added maybe not so baffling after all , the interests of executives in most mergers are not necessarily aligned with those of their company s shareholders executives of the companies being acquired hit the jackpot in these deals because their stock option grants , restricted shares and retirement plans turn into instant cash if their companies remained independent , this largess would be accessible only over longer periods consider what joseph w saunders , providian s chief executive , who joined the company in late 2001 , stands to receive if the deal with wamu goes through let s begin with his options in 2004 , he received 350 , 000 options exercisable at 1329 each that s 165 percent of all the options granted by providian last year in 2003 , he received 125 million options with a strike of 733 that grant was 167 percent of all the options dispensed that year and in 2002 , his first full year on the job , he received 11 million options priced at 7155 that award was 137 percent of the total given out by the company during the year these are , by any measure , exceedingly generous grants the median option grant made to chief executives at 409 large companies last year was 567 percent of the awards made companywide , according to equilar , a compensation analysis firm mr saunders s grants average about three times the median chief executive s is n't it nice that these grants 11 million shares in mr saunders s pocket at last count can now be cashed in , without delay \? all told , the top providian executives can cash in 35 million options and restricted shares if the takeover goes through mr saunders will also receive the usual merger payments equal to three times his providian salary and bonus and his new employment agreement with wamu he will become president and chief executive of its credit card division entitles him to restricted shares in that company worth 2 million when the merger is completed he will also get options equal to three times the amount of restricted shares he receives given the increasingly enormous paydays that takeovers can represent for executives , it s a good thing that directors , who owe fiduciary duties to the shareholders they represent , are there to make sure that any deal produces the highest possible price to the owners or are they \? after all , when directors have received restricted shares and options for their board service , they stand to receive payouts , albeit smaller ones , in a takeover as well if they say no to the deals , those payouts are no longer immediate providian s outside directors receive annual retainers of 60 , 000 for their service but if they choose to take their compensation in providian stock , they can receive an additional award of restricted shares equal to 25 percent of the pay they take in stock half of the restricted shares can be cashed in after three years and the rest after six years if the merger goes through , however , these shares can be cashed in at once and last year , providian began adding stock awards worth 100 , 000 to the annual retainers it pays its directors outside directors received 6 , 582 stock options exercisable at 12 each and 4 , 166 restricted shares providian s eight outside directors are james p holdcroft jr , a private investor who hails from wall street ruth m owades , president of owades enterprises , a consumer marketing enterprise jane a truelove , a private investor who was a senior vice president at fidelity investments richard d field , a private investor and former executive at bank of new york f warren mcfarlan , a harvard business school professor john l douglas , a partner at alston bird , a law firm that has provided services to providian in the past robert j higgins , a private investor who was a director at rhode island s department of administration and francesca ruiz de luzuriaga , an independent business development consultant who had been an executive at mattel inc alan elias , a providian spokesman , said that none of the company s outside directors would discuss the deliberations they made to conclude that the deal was fair we fully expect the deal to conclude in the beginning of the fourth quarter and we continue to believe that the proposed merger is fair and equitable , mr elias said he declined to comment further gary lutin , an investment banker at lutin company in new york , who runs shareholder forums on corporate control matters , says the proposal to buy providian is a transaction that cries out for an independent , thirdparty appraisal the investment bankers have significant interests in fees that are purely contingent on the transaction as well as continuing relationships with managements , mr lutin said and management and directors of providian are similarly biased by an option incentive plan that is based on nowdiscredited concepts of alignment with shareholder interests mr lutin has written to mr saunders , asking providian to cooperate with an objective analyst who will be hired to make an independent assessment of the deal mr elias said the company would probably not do so mr king , of putnam investments , said he favored such an analysis , especially because it would help small investors who do n't have the resources to scrutinize a deal taking a vocal stance against a merger is unusual for putnam , but mr king says it will probably take similar actions whenever its analysts conclude that prices proposed in takeovers are too low this is an extension of a direction we 've been going in for some time , he said let s hope that other investors , large and small , join in to reject the deal after all , because the premium in the takeover is so small , providian shareholders have little downside if it fails the upsides , meanwhile , are evident a possibly higher price for the company from another bidder or a rising stock price based on the company s improving fundamentals if investors want to get their fair share of capitalism s benefits , mr lutin said , they need to make better use of their rights in other words , just say no
the outlaw bible of american literature edited by alan kaufman , neil ortenberg and barney rosset illustrated 662 pp thunder s mouth press paper , 2495 back in the late 1930 s , when philip rahv made that famous distinction between american literature s redskins \( yawping walt whitman \) and palefaces \( finicking henry james \) , he was talking about contrasting sensibilities , not armed camps but in the 50 s , all hell broke loose with the publication of on the road , howl and naked lunch , the beat writers and the establishment \( which might have been smug enough not to have realized it was any such thing \) declared war on each other , and the beats were cast and certainly cast themselves as the rebelangels of a perpetual insurrection , recruiting from beyond the grave \( blake , rimbaud \) , trying to enlist neglected , potentially sympathetic elders \( pound , williams \) and potential fellow travelers \( the black mountain school \) , proselytizing the young earlier american misfits , from melville through robinson jeffers , had probably figured neglect was just their personal tough luck now misfits had a movement , even if they were too cantankerous to sign up a literary counterculture with an alternative at heart , a miltonic reading of literary history the entrance exam was largely a background check , and nobody graded the written portion that s a short version of the history behind the outlaw bible of american literature , a new anthology put together by the writer alan kaufman , the editor neil ortenberg and the seminal publisher barney rosset , whose grove press and evergreen review gave a brand and more important , a home to writers once deemed , for whatever reason , too dangerous to handle some of the foreigners rosset supported \( beckett , pinter , ionesco \) have long since become respectable , if no less formidable but most of the americans he published \( william s burroughs , jack kerouac , terry southern \) remain outsiders in part this is because of the work itself sometimes semipornographic though seldom gamier than passages in john updike and philip roth sometimes antiestablishmentarian , sometimes hard to read , sometimes all of the above but in part it s because the idea of literary outlawry any kind of outlawry is irresistible to the american imagination , which may never outgrow its puritanmanichaean origins in fact , for two cents , i 'd say the outlaw bible is a quintessential document of the bush era , but that would hurt everybody s feelings at any rate , although the rossetsponsored rebels of the 50 s and 60 s center this collection , the editors have opened the countercanon wide to take in a full range of american unclubbables mickey spillane , sapphire , waylon jennings , john waters , greil marcus , margaret sanger , dave eggers , dmx you wo n't find all of these people together in any other book , ever \( the only folks not invited to the party seem to be the farright cranks the militiapersons in the turner diaries may be extralegal , but they 're not outlaws \) it s just what an anthology of alternative outsider literature ought to be all over the place you can read woody guthrie on hopping freights , valerie solanas on cutting up men and emma goldman on doing prison time as long as you 're not expecting that all these writers can write , there s no reason you should n't have a good time but the outlaw bible is supposed to be good for you , and that s what changes it from an entertaining miscellany to something worth thinking about depending on where you sit , it s either a document recodifying a revolution or a relic recyling an obsolescent controversy the editors' introduction , of course , argues for its contemporary relevance a revolt against a landscape dominated by a literary dictatorship of tepid taste , political correctness and sheer numbing banality your reflexive reaction is to leap to your feet , whet your knife and take the tarp off the old tumbrel the problem with numbing banality is , it does n't numb you enough but then you remember what year it is true , goon squads of editors and critics still keep the frightened masses buying superficially quiet fiction about superficially quiet people by alice munro and marilynne robinson but some of the writers the regime is now grooming to take power look a lot like insurgents themselves indecorous , sometimes indecent , not snobby about pop culture whatever you think of david foster wallace or michael chabon , gary shteyngart or jonathan safran foer , they 're more mermaid than prufrock for every current bigname writer who s flatlining , i can name you one who s redlining \( but not here we 'll talk after the show \) kaufman and his fellow editors seem to be fighting battles that were over with half a century ago in romanticsentimental language that should have been over with half a century ago some of our best , our fiercest , our most volcanic prose , they write , is not a tonguetwisted henry jamesian labyrinth of 'creative writing' but an outraged american songline of tearstained revelation i ca n't sit still for james either who the hell can \? but the editors ought to visit some creative writing classes these days , both jamesian maundering and vesuvian spewing get the red pencil and the attempt to transplant bebopera grievances to a hiphop world in the grip of google and walmart only makes them sound clueless this alternative canon , they write , springs not from reality shows , botox or ipo s , but the streets , prisons , highways , trailer parks and back alleys of the american dream jeez , why pick on google , the most useful tool since the stone ax \? \( that s how i found out it was rahv and not lionel trilling or somebody who 'd thought up the paleface redskin thing took me 30 seconds \) and if you 're all about the trailer park and the prison , why dis walmart , which melds the two so perfectly that writers should stop wishing it away and start hanging out there and taking notes \? the outlaw bible may be an uneven reading experience after reprinting that bit of bob dylan s tarantula , the editors have their nerve to complain about tonguetwisted labyrinths but it makes an absorbing exercise in taxonomy who exactly qualifies as an outlaw and why \? let s try a little quiz without looking at the table of contents , which two made the grade \? a \) bret easton ellis b \) norman mailer c \) grace paley d \) raymond carver time s up b and c mailer qualifies because he s walked a tightrope over public opinion , often with a dagger in his teeth possibly an allusion to his stabbing his wife all those years ago \? for his hipster manifesto 'the white negro' and his literary sponsorship of the criminal jack henry abbott \( who s also in the anthology \) paley has published highly acclaimed collections of short fiction , but heck , so has munro selling point her antiwar , antinuke and feminist activism so what s wrong with ellis and carver \? if you read carefully the stuff i quoted above i ca n't blame you if you skimmed you 'll see why they do n't belong in the club of those who do n't belong in the club patrick bateman in ellis s american psycho is far more crazed and violent than stephen rojack in mailer s american dream , but he s an ipo kind of guy out carver passes the trailerpark test , but his flintlike precisionism does n't fit the lavaflow aesthetic outlaws are not anal now that you understand the rules , here s round 2 none of these writers made it into the outlaw bible , but two of them might have again , pick the outlaws a \) charles bukowski b \) susan sontag c \) jim bouton d \) ernest hemingway you 're catching on a and c sontag s politics are ok , but she had that mandarin thing happening forget it an outlaw ca n't be a fancy pants hemingway gets points for his suicide and his slumming check out that story a pursuit race it s got a guy shooting dope but precisionism and the nobel prize are dealbreakers bukowski \? absolutely workingclass boozer , volcanically prolific , neglected except for a cult following bouton \? a borderline case i threw him in to make it interesting in ball four , he admits he was too chicken to take the acid hippies offered him in haightashbury but any writer subversive enough to have the baseball commissioner tell him he 'd done the game a grave disservice and then to use the quotation on his book jacket ought to get the benefit of the doubt mailer himself once did the pansasblurbs thing in an ad for the deer park if you believe the editors' introduction , what makes an outlaw writer is n't the writing but the life the authors in this collection are not greeted with book club invitations take that , jonathan franzen and white house invitations \( in fact , by my count , four of the contributors were invited to the white house at one time or another , and they went like lambs the excerpt from dick gregory s autobiography even tells about it \) rather , these writers often lead lives of state pen incarceration rhymes with quiet desperation street hustling , exile , martyrdom , and even murder at the hands of strangers william s burroughs traveled to the edge of heroin addiction and preserved in deathless prose what he found there iceberg slim ran whores before turning his hand to books ken kesey captured the american heart in great epic novels before transforming its society through merry prankster revolution understand , i have nothing against heroin addiction , running whores or transforming society it s all good but i wonder about the tacit assumption that such experiences make your tearstained prose sing would n't revision be less timeconsuming and involve less wear and tear \? and the four writers who get special mention richard brautigan , breece d'j pancake , donald goines and f x toole are specifically singled out for having died the first two by suicide , goines by murder , toole a year after his only book appeared this may be too zen to get your head around , but i'm tempted to think that not living long enough to write anything at all might be a literary outlaw s savviest career move i'm also tempted to make a really snarky transition here but let s just say that some of the old obligatories in this anthology the canonical noncanonicals are starting to show their age the scene in terry southern and mason hoffenberg s candy in which the heroine is seduced by a hunchback with a wild , impulsive cry , she shrieked 'give me your hump !

chicago , oct 23 scott podsednik had two ways to end game 2 of the world series on sunday night , and neither was a strength of his he has a poor arm in left field and is not a power hitter his arm did not help him , but his power has carried the chicago white sox to a twogamestonone lead in the world series after failing to throw out the tying runner at the plate with two outs in the top of the ninth inning , podsednik drilled a gameending home run off brad lidge to upend the houston astros , 76 , in a thriller at drizzly us cellular field i do n't think anybody in the ballpark was thinking about me hitting the ball out of the ballpark , podsednik said , but that is what he did for the second time this postseason podsednik , chicago s speedy leadoff hitter , did not hit a homer in the regular season but he hit one in the division series , and he sent a 21 fastball from lidge 408 feet over the fence in rightcenter field the white sox players leaped joyously from their dugout , crashing into each other and bouncing together at the plate as podsednik trotted into the throng we 're certainly not in a good spot , astros manager phil garner said as badly as we played , we had a chance to win this ballgame that would have been a feelgood experience we just have to go home and regroup we 'll bounce back we 'll make a series out of this the series shifts to minute maid park in houston for game 3 on tuesday , and the astros must play tighter defense to win their ragged play in the field led to two early runs for the white sox , but andy pettitte got big outs when he needed them and had a 42 lead when he left after six innings pettitte made his 11th career world series start , tying him with christy mathewson and waite hoyt for second on the career list behind whitey ford the latter three are in the hall of fame dan wheeler took over in the seventh , and with two outs and a full count on jermaine dye , wheeler threw a pitch up and in that grazed the barrel of dye s bat the homeplate umpire , jeff nelson , ruled that dye had been hit by the pitch , and garner argued , asking to see the ball for a black mark from the bat but the ball was lost , garner said , and his pleading went nowhere after the game , even dye admitted that nelson was wrong it did n't hit me , dye said i turned and he told me it hit me when the umpire tells you to go to first base , you go to first base i'm not going to tell him i fouled it off had the ball been ruled foul , the count would have stayed at 32 on dye instead , the bases were loaded for paul konerko , who was the most valuable player in the american league championship series after hitting two homers against the angels konerko put an effortless swing on a firstpitch fastball from chad qualls , hitting a grand slam over the white sox' bullpen in left field it was the first slam in the world series since the yankees' tino martinez hit one in 1998 , and konerko raised his fists over his head as he reached first base fireworks exploded beyond the stadium walls , and konerko took two curtain calls from the fans as the white sox grabbed a 64 lead he s got nasty stuff , that guy , konerko said of qualls he threw it exactly where i was looking , and i think that s what it might have taken to do it konerko , who became a father for the first time tuesday , added , it s the secondbest feeling i 've had all week the lead seemed to be a safe lead for bobby jenks , who had overpowered the astros with 100mileanhour fastballs to save game 1 but jeff bagwell singled to lead off the ninth , and jenks walked chris burke with one out it was the first walk by the white sox this series , and it was costly after a groundout moved the runners to second and third , jose vizcaino dumped a single to shallow left i made a good pitch to him , down and away , jenks said he just got enough of it to get it over the infield bagwell scored easily , and burke had not even hit third base by the time podsednik gathered the ball but the houston thirdbase coach , doug mansolino , waved burke home , and he slid artfully at the plate , avoiding the tag of aj pierzynski and tagging the plate with his hand down by two with two outs , the astros had tied the score at 66 even after mike lamb flied to left off neal cotts to end the inning , houston still must have been encouraged by the presence of lidge but this outing was no better than lidge s last , when the cardinals' albert pujols sent a slider into orbit for a threerun homer after houston had been one out away from the pennant he retired juan uribe on a flyout , but then podsednik struck the one to pujols was more frustrating , because it was a mistake , lidge said this one really was n't i just tip my hat on this one lidge s biggest mistake against podsednik was probably falling behind in the count , 21 podsednik did not expect to hit a home run , but he knew he might get a pitch to drive i did n't think that he was going to walk me , podsednik said luckily , i got into a hitter s count i was looking fastball the entire atbat , and i got one on 21 podsednik guessed correctly even without using his speed , it came into play recognizing what could happen if podsednik reached first base , lidge decided not to risk a walk i do n't want to fall behind 31 and have a chance of him getting on base , lidge said i wanted to throw him a strike it probably got too much of the plate obviously , it did my thinking is , he s not a home run hitter , and i do n't want him to be on the bases where he s a threat podsednik s stay on the bases was brief , just long enough for a rare and remarkable home run trot

the executive director of jacobi medical center was fired yesterday , about a week after the city discovered that hundreds of women were not informed of the results of their cancer screening tests because of a flawed system in deciding to dismiss joseph orlando , 58 , the director of the cityrun hospital for a decade , city officials said they were trying to restore the public s faith in jacobi i hope that our swift and decisive action to correct this inexcusable failure begins to regain our patients' trust that we understand their safety and wellbeing must be our highest priority , said alan aviles , the acting director of the health and hospitals corporation , which oversees jacobi a spokeswoman for the hospital said mr orlando was not available for comment in a statement , corporation officials said they exercised their right to terminate mr orlando without cause , as his contract stipulated william p walsh , who is the corporation s senior vice president of the southern brooklyn and staten island health network , will take over the job on a temporary basis the shakeup comes after city officials announced on tuesday that 307 women were not informed about abnormal results on pap smear tests pap smears are a routine but important screening test for cervical cancer women who have abnormal results are supposed to have more extensive testing to be sure they do not have cancer in this case , some women were not told of their results for more than a year since the discovery of the mistake , all but one of the women have been notified , and hospital officials said that so far none had tested positive for cancer mayor michael r bloomberg said the mistake was unacceptable we are playing with people s lives here , mr bloomberg told reporters on thursday the question is , was supervision adequate up the chain \? he said and i think the answer is clearly no jacobi s failure had its origins in a decision made about 16 months ago , when a single clerk was placed in charge of notifying thousands of patients about their results during that period , about 20 , 000 pap smear tests were conducted at the hospital of those , 5 , 207 showed abnormalities that would require followup care city hospital officials acknowledged that no one at jacobi had been monitoring the clerk , and that the problem had come to light only because one patient , upon realizing she had not been given her results , filed a formal complaint city officials said they had also fired the deputy director of nursing services responsible for women s health services another employee was removed from his supervisory position , and two additional staff members the hospital s chief operating officer and medical director have received formal disciplinary warnings the clerk who failed to inform patients has been suspended and is facing further disciplinary action in a statement , the health and hospitals corporation said it had reviewed the other cityrun hospitals to ensure that there were no similar problems that review has confirmed that all other hhc hospitals are issuing appropriate , timely and welldocumented notifications to patients about abnormal pap test results , the statement said
on the subject of don carlo , commissioned by the paris opera , the composer was his own harshest critic in this drama there is nothing historical , giuseppe verdi once wrote , nor is there any

bestowed on philip instead philip really did incarcerate his son , who in life was a haughty and violent mental defective , subject to fits of homicidal rage as for the oedipal love triangle the librettists joseph m ry and camille du locle constructed around these wisps of fact , that indeed is pure fantasy in real life , philip s shortlived heir and third bride \( both 154568 \) were practically children at the time m ry and du locle were drawing on the highflown dramatic poem don carlos of friedrich schiller , who cast his hero as an aggrieved , hypersensitive hamlet of spain , in desperate search of a mission schiller s prince \( and verdi s \) has his horatio in the wholly imaginary freethinking marquis of posa , who urges him to join the fight to liberate oppressed flanders likewise imaginary \( though she shares her name with a historical person \) is the scintillating princess eboli , a snake in the grass who sleeps with the king but lusts for his son one difficulty with don carlo is that it unfolds in broken arcs , like a suite of tapestries traditionally , directors and designers have underscored that effect , opting for costume drama in literalminded d cor elisabeth , heroic beneath her decorum , is often played mistakenly as a plaster saint grand opera implies pageantry , of course , and don carlo one of the grandest delivers not only a coronation but also a bonfire to the accompaniment of a heavenly voice that welcomes the burning heretics into the presence of god the original scenario calls for seven locations a monastery , a garden , a cathedral square , a prison and so on each made to order for ponderous victorian history painting disjointed don carlo may be , but its grandeur is unsurpassed among the highlights the stirring prayer and oath of friendship for carlo and posa \( a love duet in all but name \) solemn chant from the chorus of monks and bejeweled song from the court ladies at leisure two showstopping arias in contrasting styles for eboli \( and who cares if neither has much plot function \) the prince s fatal tryst by moonlight with the wrong woman the king s soliloquy in the cold light of dawn , contemplating the wreckage of a loveless marriage his conference with the grand inquisitor , a blind nonagenarian , come to condone the prince s execution and to demand posa s murder in the writing , don carlo gave verdi no end of trouble for a blowbyblow account , consult julian budden s authoritative threevolume study the operas of verdi \( oxford \) , which distinguishes five versions , beginning with the fiveact score , complete with the ballet paris audiences expected , as verdi delivered it to the paris opera \( 1866 \) next comes the abbreviated version actually performed at the world premiere in 1867 and published the same year which version is best \? the standard version unlikely to be supplanted is the fourth , introduced at la scala , in milan , in 1884 included here are definitive , sharply heightened realizations of some crucial episodes gone in its entirety , however , is the ballet , which affects the design not at all gone , too , is the entire original first act , which skews things greatly the lost act is set in france , in the wintry forest of fontainebleau here , don carlo , in disguise , meets elisabeth , wins her heart , and reveals his true identity and here the lovers learn that the statesmen who dictate their fate have changed their minds to secure the peace between france and spain , elisabeth is now to bestow her hand on philip a noble slave to duty , she accepts in a single heartbroken syllable dramatically , the scene at fontainebleau lays the foundation for all that is to come musically , it contains essential material to which the later acts refer in the edition of 1886 , fontainebleau was restored \( adding a halfhour to a running time that already includes three solid hours of music \) these days , whenever a major new production of don carlo is announced , aficionados want to know is it in five acts or four \? and is it in french or italian \? purists want french , on the very good grounds that verdi composed and revised it in that language \( as don carlos \) it is easy to find passages where the italian translation is generic , pompous , vague or misleading , yet the case for french is by no means open and shut the original text has its infelicities , too moreover , verdi s ear for the ebb and flow of french verse is not as unerring as his ear for italian the current met production , in italian , offered its distinctive solution to the don carlo dilemma no music is being cut that verdi chose to retain , the met explained , and none of his revisions are replaced by unrevised passages the company reinstates fontainebleau , complete with recently rediscovered pages discarded before the paris premiere there is no ballet a quarter century later , the met s approach remains persuasive , but it hardly precludes others ambitious attempts there have been some ambitious attempts over the last year in june , the netherlands opera in amsterdam and the berlin state opera weighed in with new productions , followed in october by the vienna state opera in december , the teatro del maggio musicale in florence revived the milestone staging by luchino visconti , originally produced for covent garden , london , in 1958 a dvd of the amsterdam production has been promised for later this year , adding to a considerable list already on the market the most eagerly awaited new entry was vienna s , a world premiere the score was verdi s original of 1866 , in french , with first act , ballet music , and all the production , however , was belligerently up to the minute in his vienna debut , the director peter konwitschny , provocateurdarling of the german critics , sent his cast crawling hither and yon on all fours , cooked up some hamfisted gags and injected some jolts of gratuitous sadism to the music of the ballet \( familiar to balletomanes from george balanchine s delectable ballo della regina \) , he brought on the five principals for a pantomime entitled eboli s dream , a vision of goofy domestic felicity straight out of i love lucy tellingly , don carlos the big baby wound up in a crib do n't stage the libretto stage the whole thing , mr konwitschny likes to say , always adding , do n't stage the music stage the whole thing be it said in his defense that his freeforall was frisky and while it often made a mockery of the mood , it did comment in its own scurrilous way on the opera s every jot and tittle props were invested with heavy symbolic weight as a sign of his political myopia , posa the soldier wore a bookworm s heavy glasses and for his coup de r sistance , mr konwitschny staged the autodaf as a live telecast of breaking news the procession began outside the opera house , winding through the lobby and auditorium en route to the stage patrons could watch the hubbub on monitors in the grand staircase if they liked , with awful broadcast sound piped in it so happens that the autodaf was spliced into the original scenario at verdi s request for crass commercial appeal , and recent commentators tend to regard it as something of an embarrassment so , no doubt , does mr konwitschny , whose realization delivered an implicit critique especially scathing was an onstage cameo for the heavenly voice rather than warbling from above , as verdi intended , the singer put in a personal appearance \( think c line dion at ground zero \) , crooning gooey benedictions to the cameras and falling out of her dress the vienna press not only ate all this up , they licked their plates and asked for more , forgiving a musical execution that was far from distinguished vocally , the cast \( iano tamar , nadja michael , ram n vargas , bo skovhus , alastair miles \) ranged from adequate to abysmal and in the pit , under the slack baton of bertrand de billy , the ragged orchestra , renowned on international concert stages as the vienna philharmonic , was unrecognizable a hairraising debut amsterdam and berlin stuck to the standard edition , in italian willy decker , in amsterdam , proved as microscopic an interpreter as mr konwitschny but not such a joker mr decker s set replicated in laboratory white the royal crypt at el escorial outside madrid the costumes looked like el greco court dress reinterpreted by prada the action and the imagery throughout were sharp and clean but the big news here was the hairraising debut of rolando villaz n in the title role taking his cue from the history schiller deliberately suppressed , mr decker asked him to play the prince as a madman , a danger to himself and others contrary to verdi , the action concluded in the prince s suicide it was a daring choice , validated in rave reviews and prolonged ovations the drawing card of the berlin production , which i missed , was the matchless singingactor ren pape as the king as described in the overwhelmingly hostile press , the director , philipp himmelmann , set his entire production around a dinner table in a reductive attempt to play up the domestic tragedy happily , mr pape , who scored a personal triumph , went on to perform the role again under what promised to be more satisfying circumstances in florence visconti conceived his production for covent garden in five acts , an even more unusual choice then than it would be today florence presented alternating performances in both five acts and four \( in an irresponsible , defective edition that stripped the hero of his single aria \) the stage pictures , inspired by the 16thcentury spanish masters , conveyed the dignity , sobriety and restraint of their sources as one could see in an open scene change \( the technical crew s creative and warmly applauded alternative to a strike in protest against draconian cuts in state support \) , the scenery consisted mostly of painted canvas yet as the elements moved into place , they assumed a solidity and presence perfectly suited to verdi s solemn themes intimations of the present alas , visconti has been dead for three decades now , and the psychologically penetrating character portraits his settings cried out for did not materialize , with the two casts milling around the stage more or less at will mr pape s king , however , created his own reality , burning with smothered wrath his soliloquy , no aria this time but a devastating private meditation , earned a call of grande ! from a connoisseur in the boxes a rarer tribute and a higher one than the firestorm of bravos that followed some ascribe the current vogue for don carlo to the rattled state of our world unfolding against a backdrop of distant war , militant fundamentalism and statesponsored terror , the domestic imbroglios at the court of spain may indeed possess a subliminal contemporary resonance but as mr pape s king revealed , the lasting power of don carlo lies elsewhere in the anatomy of loves , betrayals and crises of selfworth that waste the heart the differing productions on dvd in the end , the ideal don carlo may be the one you mount for yourself in the theater of your mind to a degree , dvd s can help you prepare the metropolitan opera production , a fine point of reference , is documented on pioneer classics in a telecast from 1983 , when james levine was conducting and pl cido domingo , in prime form , bestrode the stage like the young henry viii , in the thrilling company of mirella freni \( elisabeth \) , grace bumbry \( eboli \) and nicolai ghiaurov \( philip \) from the salzburg festival in 1986 comes the standard edition , conducted with fire and brimstone by herbert von karajan but staged by him like a diorama at madame tussaud s nonetheless , jos carreras registers as a prince of affecting refinement \( sony classical \) from la scala in 1992 comes another standard version , this one a jewelencrusted extravaganza by franco zeffirelli \( once luchino visconti s assistant , but temperamentally worlds apart from the patrician austerity of his mentor \) at the head of a cast that averages out at less than stellar , luciano pavarotti is woefully out of his element under riccardo muti , the fantastic range of colors and nerveend intensity of the orchestra compensate to a surprising extent \( emi \) the french version as played in 1867 is available , too , as revived at the th tre du ch telet in paris in 1996 under the baton of antonio pappano quibble if you will at the lightweight casting of jos van dam as the king but luc bondy s production is contemporary european music theater at its peak rich in visual metaphor , deep in intellectual understanding , generous in emotion roberto alagna and karita mattila inhabit the lovers with an immediacy that reveals every fiber of their being historical \? no shakespearean \? oh , who knows but as truthful as verdi must have known his opera to be matthew gurewitsch don carlo is at the metopolitan opera house at lincoln center at 1 pm tomorrow the production runs in repertory through april 2 information \( 212 \)

an essential element of wife swap the abc program in which two women with starkly different lives switch families for a few days is that each woman should learn something about herself by walking in the shoes of the other but the two women featured in tonight s episode say that perhaps their most valuable lesson concerned the creative liberties involved in assembling a show that is in the vanguard of the latest wave of socalled reality television their observations , in interviews arranged by abc to promote tonight s episode , instead serve to provide a rare behindthescenes glimpse of how those shows featuring a documentarystyle examination of people s lives as opposed to the cutthroat competition of shows like the apprentice and survivor rely more heavily on the techniques of scripted drama than the shows let on at least based on the experience of tonight s featured wives christy oeth , a working mother from suburban philadelphia , and nancy cedarquist , who is homeschooling her six children in northern vermont making a swap ready for prime time can entail withholding facts from the viewer that might muddle the central premise supplying participants with material to read aloud rehearsing pivotal confrontations offscreen and , in some cases , reenacting events the cameras missed in tonight s episode , for example , the oeths , a family of six , are described by the narrator as putting success before family life and as high achievers who run their family like a business in pitching the episode in a onepage memorandum to abc , the show s producers a british company called rdf media , which also produces a british version posed the following question will mrs oeth get in touch with her natural maternal instincts \? in fact , mrs oeth , 36 , who works at an investment firm , said in a telephone interview this week that she had stayed home for five years to raise her four children , a fact the producers never share with viewers , and that she had returned to work only last year , when her husband left a highpressure job in manhattan there is a very big element of unreality to the way they pigeonholed me , she said this was also the case for nancy cedarquist , 36 the cedarquists are portrayed as having dropped out of society to live in a treehouse , and that is technically true their home , which has no cement foundation , is indeed perched on the bases of 11 trees but another assertion by the narrator at the outset of the program husband keith is the only one who leaves the treehouse on a daily basis , to work at the local paper mill ignores the many activities in which their four older children have participated at the local schools , including ballet , a pompom squad , basketball and band none of these activities is ever shown or mentioned moreover , no mention is made in tonight s episode that tensions between mrs cedarquist and michael oeth had so grown during the five days she spent living in the oeth house in yardley , pa , that the producers effectively evacuated her early and installed her in a sheraton hotel nearby , driving her to and from the house until her final scenes were completed and do not get mrs cedarquist started on the scene she agreed to film in which , she says , she pretended to be asleep she had indeed overslept one day , but cameras were not present or the new rules she agreed to post for the oeth children , which , she said , were written not by her \( as the narrator suggests \) but by a producer working offcamera on a laptop computer this is where you should play the stupid hillbilly music , mrs cedarquist said , a reference to the dueling banjoes style soundtrack that is , incongruously , laid over images of her montgomery center , vt , home i really thought reality television was more real than it is to wendy roth , coexecutive producer of wife swap , the postproduction concerns expressed by the two women are a function , at least in part , of a na vet people have about reality television a documentary is a news show , said ms roth , who has worked as a producer on good morning america and several primetime oprah winfrey specials we come out of the entertainment division there is a certain amount of poetic license ms roth acknowledged , for example , that mention of the five years mrs oeth spent raising her children full time was omitted from the episode , not because it would have complicated the episode s stark premise coldhearted working mom versus nurturing stayathome mom but because we do n't do back stories on our show the most back story we do is , 'they live in a treehouse and they built it themselves , ' she said we do what s happening in the present otherwise it gets too bogged down ms roth said the two women , who were shown rough versions of tonight s episode last week , might have fallen victim to two afflictions that frequently befall not just realityshow participants but also people interviewed for television news programs and even newspapers one is the reality that while nearly 100 hours may have been recorded as is the case with wife swap only 43 minutes can be broadcast , which , she said , always necessitates hard editing choices but each woman had also raised concerns that neither the way they are portrayed nor the way they sound matched what they saw and heard in their own minds and that , too , ms roth said , is common you know how you have an image of what your life looks like to other people \? she said at some point , they realize the way they see themselves and the way other people see their lives is n't exactly the same wife swap thrives on its ability to get viewers to see themselves or at least their ideals represented in the life of one player , and under assault from the other by nature , the show s structure dictates that the participants be presented as caricatures in earlier episodes , for example , an heiress from new york city was switched with a woodcutter from new jersey a woman with two dozen pets traded for a neat freak and , as was widely reported last month , a lesbian toggled with a woman who was antigay thus far the show , in its first full season , has enjoyed relatively high ratings it is seen by an average of 94 million viewers each week , which places it behind such reality fare as survivor palau \( 223 million \) and the apprentice \( 15 million \) , according to nielsen media research , but ahead of the contender \( 89 million viewers last thursday \) each episode of wife swap takes months to research and produce on a big board in the show s manhattan offices , near the port authority bus terminal , the producers have listed descriptions they hope to match with actual families tattoo parlor , rocket scientist , midwife in the cases of both the cedarquists and the oeths , many details presented in tonight s broadcast are deadon accurate , the participants agree mr oeth , for example , does , as the narrator intones , type his grocery list on a spreadsheet and then overlay it on a floor map of the local supermarket not all the relevant details omitted from the broadcast are the responsibility of the producers in an interview , mrs cedarquist said she actually worked 20 hours a week many of them outside the home in a rental property management business she had joined in september she made no mention of her work in her application ms roth , the producer , said she had been unaware of mrs cedarquist s work until told by a reporter mrs cedarquist said she had attempted to bring her job to the attention of a field producer , but had been discouraged from doing so as for mrs cedarquist s other assertions , ms roth disputed that the scene of her oversleeping had been reenacted , but cautioned , i was n't there she made no apology for having a producer draw up mrs cedarquist s socalled rules for the oeth house the rule changes we always rehearse , she said it s a major format point when asked why mrs cedarquist s evacuation to the hotel was not portrayed , ms roth said she was satisfied that the tension between mrs cedarquist and her new family was apparent mr oeth is shown tearing the rules off the wall and that no more needed to be shown while the producers said they had hoped mrs oeth would learn to loosen up a little bit , she came away with a different take watching the disarray in the cedarquist house , she said , had cemented her belief that she was causing no harm to her children by putting them in day care and school and then working a full day i 've let go of that nonsense guilt , she said mrs cedarquist was far more jaded by the experience , and is seriously considering a new career for herself one she imagines introducing on the program headed by ms roth s former boss , oprah winfrey i 'd like to offer myself up as a support person for people who go on these shows , she said
he was a ninth grader when the gambling addiction was born it started with me with 5 , new york knicks versus houston rockets , said the 18yearold graduate of scarsdale high school , who asked to remain anonymous , and a couple of years later i was betting 7 , 000 on a game before long , he had fallen into a spiral of borrowing money from friends , wheedling cash from his father and selling marijuana to keep his habit going now , just months after quitting , he is speaking at local high schools about a problem that is getting increased attention in westchester gambling addictions among adolescents it s definitely something we need to be concerned about , said marlene furtick , executive director of the westchester county youth bureau in white plains , which doles out federal , state and county funds to nonprofit groups working with young people this is something that is quietly gaining momentum among kids while the county has turned its attention to problems like underage drinking , teenage pregnancy and childhood obesity , gambling has in the meantime become an outlet for young people in westchester it s alive on the internet , and most prevalently in the weekly poker games that adolescents have begun to organize if frank limone s recent experience is any kind of barometer , that outlet is becoming less and less benign in the past year mr limone , who coordinates the problem gambling recovery program at westchester jewish community services in mamaroneck , has been called in to three county high schools by counselors raising concerns about student gambling something that he said had n't happened in years past mr limone , whom county government and school officials describe as the only gambling counselor in westchester , says the reason there are n't many adolescent gamblers in treatment he s had two in the past year is that parents and teachers are n't aware that the behavior they are increasingly witnessing can be a sign of trouble as school authorities are catching students in the act of gambling on the internet , or devoting more time to their poker games , two other county high schools have called him in preventively to teach counselors what to do in such incidents but these first steps have been tentative ones many supervisors of young people are loath to sound the alarm on gambling poker and other games can serve as a healthy activity , they say , allowing young people a means to socialize and test themselves nor are there any recent studies or surveys that would indicate a growing county problem there has been only one comprehensive statewide study of adolescent gambling , and it was conducted eight years ago by an advocacy group in albany on the other hand , there is plenty of evidence that gambling is becoming more popular a nationwide study released this month by the annenberg public policy center at the university of pennsylvania indicates that card playing is on the rise among young people the center surveyed 1 , 501 people 14 to 22 and found that more high school and college students are playing cards in 2004 , 108 percent of the high school boys surveyed said they played in card games at least once a week , as compared with 57 percent of those surveyed in 2003 and while only 33 percent of high school girls took part in weekly games , that also represented an increase from 2003 , when 15 percent played the study was notable for another reason , too it found that teenagers and young adults enrolled in school were more likely than those who had dropped out or found jobs to bet on cards it all gets transmitted through the school culture , said dan romer , a senior research fellow at the annenberg center many young people who play lowstakes poker say it s a good way to unwind and relax with friends often without alcohol their parents agree i think it s absolutely harmless , said aj dobbs , whose son oliver is a 17yearold junior at dobbs ferry high school the kids play for minimal stakes it s clean , it s safe , you know where your kids are , mr dobbs said there tends to be a parent home there s no drinking oliver , who describes being drawn to the game by espn telecasts of poker tournaments , says the card craze has been mounting in recent months me and my friends only started playing recently , about a year ago , and keep taking on new people , he said on weeknights he plays with his friends each , he said , generally wagers 10 or 20 none of them have gone into debt or suffered emotional problems from gambling , he said i do n't have any outofcontrol friends , he said some of my friends play online , but nobody gets out of control we do n't have much money to lose but assessing what constitutes out of control has proved difficult tallying the increase in friendly poker games is a far cry from determining how many adolescents are sulking over their losses or selling their parents' stereos to pay off debts experts who have completed studies , among them dr jeffrey derevensky of mcgill university in montreal , a leading researcher in adolescent gambling addictions , estimate that 4 percent to 8 percent of adolescents suffer from a gambling problem , in differing degrees of seriousness
seattle , may 13 asked to describe the style of play of his swingman bruce bowen , san antonio spurs coach gregg popovich smiled slightly and said , very defensive during the spurs' secondround western conference playoff series against seattle , that not only has summed up bowen s game but has also been a response to criticism of it the supersonics' ray allen said recently that bowen plays dirty basketball he pulls you , he grabs you , he hits your elbow every time you shoot , allen said before the series began last sunday when you go to the basket , he 'll shove you , then he 'll fall stuff like that is annoying and not really basketball early in the second quarter of game 1 , allen drove the lane with bowen on his shoulder and turned his ankle after stepping on bowen s foot allen played only 13 minutes and scored 8 points , as the spurs coasted , 10381 afterward , allen suggested that the collision was intentional on bowen s part , saying that bowen was good for that he s done that before the allenbowen conflict has generated new debate over bowen s defense , which he developed through two seasons in the continental basketball association , two years playing in france and nine years with four teams in the nba over each of the past five seasons , bowen , 33 , has been selected to the league s alldefensive team , and this year was runnerup for the defensive player of the year award my whole thing was just trying to get on the court period , said bowen , who acquired his defensive mindset with the heat under pat riley in miami , that was the way to get on the court if you could stop somebody and the team is not scoring on you , the coaches think , 'we have to keep him on the court ' the spurs have long placed a premium on defense , from alvin robertson to david robinson to tim duncan , an eighttime selection to the league s alldefensive team many of the nba s top defenders have augmented their games with attitude dikembe mutombo was an enforcer with a fingerwagging gesture dennis rodman was a tormentor ben wallace is an intimidator ron artest is an agitator bowen is none of the above he is softspoken and affable he is involved in several charitable causes in san antonio and in his hometown , fresno , calif he does not swear it s not conducive to anything , he said it s just not necessary i'm always on the guys on my team who swear just to swear bowen said he wanted his image to be about hard work , not about being a bad guy of course that does n't get any headlines , he said but his defensive tenacity does make headlines , and some coaches and players in the league say his play borders on the malicious last season , minnesota coach flip saunders yelled , he s dirty ! to the referees when bowen became entangled with sam cassell later that season , after bowen hit the mavericks' michael finley with a forearm and was not suspended , dallas coach don nelson told the dallas morning news , you now can put me down as one of the many who have called him dirty last season , toronto s vince carter severely sprained his ankle when he came down on bowen s foot carter suggested that bowen had tried to injure him then on feb 11 of this season , while playing for the nets , carter said he thought bowen undercut him on a jumper before the two tumbled to the floor carter had to be held back from attacking bowen , and received his first career ejection allen said that incident was typical of bowen he does the little things and gets you to want to fight him allen said dwane casey , a sonics assistant , said that bowen had been accused of trying to trip opponents , but said , as a coach , it s hard to accuse him it s so hard to be able to tell , even watching film you watch the tape and think , 'was that an accident or did it happen on purpose \? ' you ca n't read his mind seattle coach nate mcmillan added , all of that stuff has been in the nba for years , grabbing a guy s shorts , grabbing an arm , hooking your arm isiah thomas would form a wedge so that when you stepped around him , he would put his foot in your way and you 'd stumble the good ones get away with it allen and bowen , who once were friends , have feuded off the court , and their rivalry on the court has been up and down this series in game 2 on tuesday , bowen was called for a foul in the first minute and picked up five fouls in 17 minutes in game 3 on thursday , however , allen shot 6 of 23 , including 0 for 6 in the final period , while being defended by bowen still , the sonics hung on to win , 9291 , and trail in the series , 21 game 4 is here on sunday mcmillan said that 80 percent of bowen s energy is on the defensive end , whereas 80 percent of ray s energy is on the offensive end so bruce can use all of his energy to stop a particular player , get in foul trouble and not be concerned about it , mcmillan said the numbers back him up bowen is averaging 28 points in the playoffs after averaging a careerhigh 82 during the regular season detroit s richard hamilton , who has battled with bowen , agreed that bowen s main concern was playing defense on the offensive end , when they 've got the ball , he s still playing defense , hamilton said i do n't think he s dirty , he added i just think he knows how to use different parts of his body to get an advantage when he fouls and stuff like that , he just do n't use his hands and his arms he uses his hips , his legs , everything , and the ref never sees it he gets away with it

it s a terrible time to try to become a rock star major labels are obsessed with hit singles and quick profits , and do n't nurture talent because small independent labels will do it for them radio stations are in a stranglehold of consolidation and payola internet filesharing may be making it harder to turn a hit into a sales blockbuster , while consumers have so many choices that they have grown fickle it s hard for something out of the ordinary to get a hearing , and nearly impossible to get a second chance so why did more than 1 , 000 bands make their way to new york city to play brief club sets at 25th annual cmj music marathon \? there were 12 , 000 official participants this year \( including those bands \) , from collegeradio disc jockeys to label presidents , and another 4 , 000 bands wanted those club slots that s because it s a great time to be in a new band technology allows cheap , doityourself recording , and nearly every computer is a cd manufacturer listeners are no longer limited by what s available at the local record store and on radio or television the internet can pick up wordofmouth and multiply it exponentially , turning a local band into an international buzz and opening up a sustainable touring circuit the contradictions of the music business were heard during the music marathon s daytime panel discussions , which veered between doityourselfer cheerleading and practical warnings what started as a gathering of collegeradio programmers cmj stands for college media journal and the people who would court them has grown , over the decades , into a larger , more amorphous sprawl of showcases and brand positioning for many , college radio has been supplanted by the internet as the earlywarning system for new musicpanels also discussed the growing influence of music blogs like www pitchforkmedia com and www fluxblog org , which provide direct links to downloadable songs chosen by idiosyncratic music obsessives predictably , there was a panel about how to market to them mostly , the cmj music marathon is where everyone is hoping to run across a few good bands like many college radio stations , cmj offered a little of everything hiphop , metal , jazz , world music , dance electronica but cmj s staple is still the selfconscious , proudly quirky rock that fills the collegeradio charts tabulated by the weekly cmj new music report the marathon s flagship concert was by the arcade fire , last year s cmj buzz band , from montreal a year ago , it played overcrowded club dates now , it filled central park summerstage s rumsey playfield , and had the guest imprimatur of none other than david bowie , who joined the arcade fire for one of his own songs , queen bitch , and one of theirs , wake up among the thousand other bands , there were more worthy musicians than anyone could possibly attend my deeply unrepresentative sampling included a few sure things the smart , ungangsta hiphop of blackalicious , the caffeinated , literary poprock of the new pornographers , and the neohippie free associations of devendra banhart , who had turned from spacy to droll as he led his band , hairy fairy there was proudly retro 1960 s psychedelia from the power trio wolfmother and from dungen , a swedish rocker who had both the golden curls and the wail of a younger robert plant there was brilliant , sustained noiserock from parts and labor minimalists with a monumental impact and splintered , jumpy , incessantly quickchanging noisehardcore from xbxrx , which wore sailor suits and thanked its audience for downloading its songs free apollo sunshine , a boston band , made straightforwardly tuneful songs go haywire cranking up the noise , suddenly mutating into psychedelic jams or mathematical riffing the joggers , from portland , ore , and ghosty , from lawrence , kans , both set up intricate guitar patterns around wistful vocal harmonies tom vek , from london , played stark , blunt , disillusioned songs driven by riffs out of garagerock and punkfunk and orenda fink , a songwriter from georgia , held an audience rapt with stately folkrock songs about devils and angels i do n't expect to hear any of these bands on commercial radio but at cmj , a few good bands are reason enough to return next year
san diego , jan 9 and now the jets take their playoff road show to face the team they largely have to thank for being in the postseason at all a day after their thrilling 2017 overtime victory over the san diego chargers in an american football conference wildcard game , the jets learned sunday that they had advanced to play pittsburgh the jets will meet the steelers on saturday at 4 30 pm at heinz field in the divisional round pittsburgh s defeat of buffalo in the final week of the regular season clinched a wildcard spot for the jets because the jets lost to st louis in their last regularseason game , they would have been kept out of the playoffs had buffalo and denver won their finales the other matchup in the afc s final four was determined sunday when indianapolis beat denver by 4924 the colts will play new england at gillette stadium in foxboro , mass , on sunday that will be the third highprofile matchup between the colts and the patriots in the last year they also met in the afc championship game last season and in this season s opener in september new england won both games on dec 12 , the jets lost in pittsburgh , 176 the teams were tied at 33 in the fourth quarter , but the game turned on a touchdown on a halfback option pass by the steelers' jerome bettis the game was typical of the jets' regularseason performances against toptier opponents , which they almost always kept close but could never quite win in three games against pittsburgh and new england , who hold the top two seedings in the afc playoffs , the jets were 03 and outscored by 5320 after the loss to the steelers , jets players mindful of a potential playoff meeting said that they looked forward to possibly meeting them again on sunday , coach herman edwards recalled a postgame conversation with pittsburgh coach bill cowher about precisely that it was kind of funny , because after the game , i visited with bill , edwards told reporters sunday at the jets' training complex in hempstead , ny he just said , 'well , we 'll probably see each other down the road' i just said , 'i hope so' so i guess we are going to see each other down the road edwards was well aware that the jets' trip to the divisional round almost did not occur because of a fourthquarter roughingthepasser penalty on linebacker eric barton leading by 1710 with 16 seconds left in regulation , the chargers faced fourthandgoal from the 2 san diego quarterback drew brees dropped back and , under pressure , lofted a desperation pass into the end zone , where it was batted incomplete it briefly appeared that the jets would be able to run out the clock and win the game but barton was flagged for delivering a forearm to brees s head as he took him to the ground it was a dumb play , barton said in the locker room after the game it was also reminiscent of an afc divisional game between the jets and the cleveland browns , coached by marty schottenheimer , in the 1986 season while leading by 10 points in the fourth quarter , jets defensive end mark gastineau was called for roughing the passer after colliding with bernie kosar the play gave cleveland new life and the browns went on to win , 2320 , in two overtimes although gastineau and the jets disputed that penalty , there was no uncertainty saturday night the foul was a foul , edwards said it was the right call i do n't think barton did anything on purpose , but he got up in the air and the elbow hit the guy in the head he was being aggressive barton agreed that the call was a correct one and it seemed likely to end to the jets' season when the chargers , also coached by schottenheimer , tied the score on the next play and drove within range of a 40yard fieldgoal attempt by nate kaeding with less than four and half minutes remaining in overtime as kaeding lined up for the kick , perhaps no one was rooting harder for him to miss than barton i was thinking , 'thank god , ' barton said , recalling the moment when kaeding s kick began to sail wide right we get to play on , and hopefully we can take over from there and we can win earlier in the overtime , barton had gone to quarterback chad pennington on the sideline and asked him to help redeem the penalty after kaeding s miss , pennington moved the jets 60 yards in eight crisp plays to do just that as doug brien s 28yard kick sailed through the uprights , barton was on the sideline raising his arms and closing his eyes i just took a deep breath and i thanked the lord , he said his teammates said that even if they had lost , they would not have allowed barton , an offseason freeagent acquisition from oakland , to blame himself i do n't fault eric barton , pennington said we voted him the most inspirational player on our team he s come in here and done an excellent job every down , every game , he plays like it s his last so that s just one of those things where his aggressiveness backfired barton said that he was relieved when brien s kick sailed true so was brien , who had hoped to make up for a missing a 33yarder at the end of the jets' first drive i do n't think i was bailing him out , brien said of barton but i felt like i bailed myself out , i missed a kick earlier in the game but none of that really matters guys made plays when we had to , and we got it done

groton , conn , may 17 in the days since the pentagon proposed closing the navy s submarine base here , gov m jodi rell has begun forming a highprofile coalition of military , political and business leaders to fight to keep the base open on tuesday , the coalition expanded to include three relatively unknown local players ben parent on guitar , trevor chandonnait on drums and steven elci on bass together , the three men are called superbald , and they have recorded a song that in 24 hours rose from an obscure musical subgenre to become a rallying cry to save the base after mrs rell met at the groton town hall annex on tuesday with dozens of business and political leaders , she and the rest of the group met superbald and then listened to a recording of submarine town it s a dirty job , men working hard building boats out in the yard in a submarine town the world has changed but it s all still the same in a submarine town first people tapped their fingers , and then they applauded mrs rell , who is a republican left with a copy of the cd the bright punkpop riff was recorded a few months ago , well before the pentagon s announcement on friday but even then people were worried about the base s future the lyrics , squeezed between 2 minutes and 27 seconds of guitar shimmer and driving drums , are more a collection of memories and mental images than a protest song or a working man s anthem but their tone is affectionate and the tune is catchy , with subtle effects that evoke the deepsea plunge of a submarine mr elci , who wrote the words and sings the lead vocal , says submarine town reflects a kind of spiritual alliance with the more than 31 , 000 people whose jobs , according to state economists , are linked to the sub base the band members are in their mid30 s and each holds a day job , though none work at the base we 've all lived here our whole lives , mr elci said this is all we know the idea to play the song for the governor and the business group came from andrea l stillman , a democratic state senator from nearby waterford mr elci , a friend of mrs stillman s family , first played the recording for her on monday do n't be surprised when you hear it on the radio , ms stillman said on tuesday it s southeast connecticut saying , 'come and help us '
guant namo bay , cuba , march 23 a 30yearold sudanese prisoner listened with barely concealed anger on tuesday and slouched deeper into his seat as an air force officer told a military panel why the man remained a threat to the united states and should not be released from the prison camp here the slight and scraggly bearded sudanese , hands cuffed and feet shackled to the floor , is among more than 500 prisoners from the fighting in afghanistan who remain here and whose cases are being reviewed under the latest military legal proceeding intended to reduce guant namo s prison population and meet the terms of a supreme court decision allowing them to challenge their detention the prisoner never heard some of the evidence against him because it was deemed classified and was given to the court in secret he disputed some of the charges , such as that he had participated in a prison riot in afghanistan , and argued that it was legal for him to have traveled there other prisoners have been more recalcitrant most of those called for hearings have refused to attend the new proceedings , known as administrative review boards , began in earnest this year they consist of panels of three military officers conducting hearings at which detainees , none of whom are allowed to have lawyers present , can tell their stories and dispute accusations that they were part of the taliban or allied with al qaeda to be released , they must persuade the board that no matter their history , they are not a threat to the united states or its allies the sudanese prisoner , whose name cannot be disclosed under ground rules set by the military , heard himself described as someone who eagerly joined the taliban and fought on the northern front during the war in afghanistan an air force officer who acted as a kind of prosecutor also asserted that the man had been a special friend of a taliban commander who worked under a senior qaeda field officer he had weapons training , the air force officer continued , and participated in a prison riot at mazarisharif like all the other military personnel in the hearing room , fashioned under a low ceiling in a doublewide trailer , the officer had his name tag covered with masking tape the sudanese prisoner was at first sullen and responded tersely through his translator to questions about whether he understood the purpose of the proceeding but when his turn came to rebut the accusations , he grew angry at the american military officers , at times lecturing the panel no , he said , he had never heard of the man described as his special friend he was at mazarisharif , he said , but could not have participated in the riot by captives at the ancient fortress there in 2002 , as the taliban collapsed , because he was handcuffed the entire time as to the accusation that he had weapons training , he said what is wrong with that \? is it forbidden by the united states for anyone in the world to train with a rifle \? asked whether he was a threat to the united states , he replied never i want to get married and live in my house all the detainees whose cases are being heard by these administrative review boards have already been through a similar process in which different military panels determined that they had been properly imprisoned at guant namo as unlawful enemy combatants during that set of hearings , 33 out of 558 detainees were deemed to have been improperly labeled enemy combatants and about 5 of those 33 have been released , military officials said , because of difficulties in making arrangements to have them transferred to their home countries the new proceedings are just like a parole board for those held after the earlier round of hearings , said capt eric kaniut of the navy , the chief administrator of both sets of hearings the bottom line we look at is whether they are a threat to the us so far , 64 detainees have had hearings scheduled before administrative review boards , and 39 have declined to attend captain kaniut said one reason was that many were skeptical about the fairness of the proceedings another reason , he said , may be that the cases against them are so strong that a hearing would be futile that is believed to be the reason in the case of a 28yearold saudi who was described as proud to be thought of as a terrorist he told one guard that he would cut his throat and struck others , according to a report read by an army officer he did not attend his hearing , and his case was disposed in 15 minutes the new set of hearings is supposed to be completed for all detainees by the end of the year , said navy secretary gordon r england , who makes the final decision on each case after receiving a recommendation from the military panel the hearings are similar but not identical to the earlier process used to determine whether the detainees were properly classified as unlawful enemy combatants one important similarity is that most of the evidence used to determine a detainee s fate comes from classified reports , and the detainees are not permitted to see it after the sudanese prisoner was led back to his cell , for example , the military panel reconvened to hear the classified evidence supporting the charges against him during the earlier hearings , detainees frequently questioned the sources of the charges that they denied , only to be told they were not permitted to know them civil liberties and bar groups strongly criticized those hearings as lacking in basic aspects of due process , notably the ability to confront one s accuser when the military chose the underused guant namo naval base to house prisoners , mostly from the afghan war , the bush administration thought that the detainees would be beyond the reach of united states and international law and could be held indefinitely , without challenge by declaring the prisoners unlawful combatants who did not fight in accordance with the geneva conventions , the administration denied them the protections provided prisoners of war under the international treaty officials said that because guant namo was part of cuba , united states law did not extend to the prisoners there last june , however , the supreme court dealt a blow to the bush administration , ruling that the guant namo prisoners could challenge their detentions in federal courts since then , more than 100 of the prisoners have been represented by american lawyers who have filed habeas corpus petitions before federal judges , asking the courts to order the government to justify the continued detentions the government has argued that its obligations to justify the detentions have been satisfied by the two sets of administrative hearings
in the wake of hurricanes katrina and rita , there has been much talk of rebuilding louisiana s coastal wetlands and barrier islands this proposal , which could cost an estimated 15 billion , has been advocated by louisiana scientists , engineers , politicians and environmentalists alike , who explain that the state is suffering the highest rate of land loss in the nation and imply that restoring this land would reduce the damage from future storms as coastal scientists , we are excited to see the idea of wetlands restoration so widely discussed yet we think the louisiana plan is ill conceived when a major storm tears apart any coastal area , people tend to take on an attitude that we can win this war with the weather if we spend enough money sadly , then , hurricanes often bequeath gigantic urban renewal projects destroyed houses are replaced by bigger ones that lack even the protection of dunes that were eroded by the storm within a few years , more property than ever stands at risk now we are being told that we should spend billions not just on rebuilding houses and roads but on reengineering the environment as well louisiana s coastal scientists , engineers and politicians suggest that without this coastal restoration project , all other efforts will be endangered but it s not that simple , for several reasons first , many people scientists and otherwise have insinuated that if we had begun wetlands restoration in the mississippi delta years ago , it would have reduced the impact of hurricane katrina on new orleans and the coast this is highly unlikely storm surge waters approached the coast from the east , pushed into lake pontchartrain by the counterclockwise flow of the hurricane s winds the natural wetlands that used to exist downriver from the city would have done little to mitigate the damage second , some have suggested that rebuilding the louisiana barrier islands would protect the delta region in future storms but just look what happened elsewhere hurricane katrina s storm surge quickly inundated the barrier islands of the gulf islands national seashore off mississippi , which are far more robust and vegetated than the louisiana islands ever were , on its way to devastating the state s shoreline let s face it , even if reconstructed , the louisiana islands would be little more than a speed bump to a storm the size of hurricane katrina in addition , none of the restoration plans address the root causes of wetland loss manmade alterations to the mississippi river that reduce the amount of sediment flowing into the marshes , the saltwater allowed in by navigation canals cut through the delta , and a lowering of ground levels throughout the region brought on by natural and industrial activities we are being sold a giant engineering project intended to fix problems caused by engineering projects elsewhere on the river and in the delta we find it paradoxical that many of the people calling for wetland restoration are also calling for higher levees to protect populated areas , since the levees , which prevent flooding and thus the natural addition of sediment to the marshes , are a big reason the wetlands are disappearing and even if we could rebuild these wetlands , maintaining them at a time of rising ocean levels is probably untenable we would be creating our own little holland , with a need for evermore expensive construction and maintenance far into the future last , if the government is going to spend 15 billion on restoration , let s put all the country s wetlands on the table we seriously doubt that any objective scientific costbenefit review would find that spending all that money in louisiana makes sense we believe there are many concerned and honest advocates for the project to restore coastal louisiana but their effort should not be mislabeled as storm protection , and we should n't allow our emotional response to a natural disaster to cloud our longterm thinking about the best way to spend our money on repairing america s coastal regions oped contributor robert s young and david m bush are professors of geology at , respectively , western carolina university and the university of west georgia
in a case with no eyewitnesses other than the police officer who is accused of killing an unarmed man in a dark chelsea warehouse , the first day of the defense came down to this noises over a police radio and the trajectory of four bullets it was the first opportunity for lawyers of the undercover officer , bryan a conroy , 26 , to present witnesses to rebut charges that he unjustifiably killed ousmane zongo , 43 , an immigrant from burkina faso in west africa , on may 22 , 2003 officer conroy , who could face up to 15 years in prison if he is convicted of manslaughter , is not expected to testify to support the claim that the two men struggled over a gun before the deadly shots were fired , the defense presented two of its three witnesses a medical expert testified that the path taken by the bullets could suggest that mr zongo had made a lunging motion although the expert conceded that the evidence was consistent with various body positions and officer conroy s partner , who was outside the warehouse , told the jurors that he heard what might have been the sounds of a struggle over his police radio before the shots were fired prosecutors contend that officer conroy was reckless in drawing his gun when he first encountered mr zongo after a raid on a counterfeitcd operation at the warehouse the defense claims that officer conroy was trying to protect himself after mr zongo grabbed for his gun in grand jury testimony that was read aloud last friday , officer conroy said he had pulled his gun and identified himself as a police officer in an attempt to subdue mr zongo he acknowledged that mr zongo appeared unarmed and not a threat , but said he gave chase when mr zongo ran off their initial encounter took place while officer conroy was guarding the confiscated cd s officer conroy said that when he found mr zongo at the end of the dark hallway , mr zongo scowled at him , grabbed at the gun and struck him in the nose i'm trying to get him off of me , he s hanging all inside of me , right on top of me , officer conroy testified it s clear to me that if this man gets my firearm , i'm dead he said he managed to break away and shoot mr zongo twice then they both stepped back and he fired two more times and mr zongo fell to the ground , he said photographs of mr zongo s dead body were shown in court for the first time , during the testimony of the defense s medical expert , dr charles wetli , who works as the chief medical examiner in suffolk county dr wetli said that all four of the bullets that struck mr zongo had a downward trajectory , consistent with the idea that whoever shot the gun was higher than the victim , perhaps because the victim was bent over officer conroy s lawyers asked dr wetli if it was consistent with a lunging motion , and he said it was but he also agreed with the prosecutor that the victim could have been lower because his knees were bent two of the bullets traveled front to back through mr zongo s body , while two moved back to front dr wetli said that the most likely scenario was that the victim was turning as the four shots were being fired , though he said he could not say it with reasonable medical certainty both sides accepted expert testimony that no blood was found on officer conroy s clothing after the shooting and that none of his hair was found on mr zongo s body the defense expects to call one more witness officer timothy scotto , who took part in the raid on monday before closing arguments are presented also testifying for the defense yesterday , officer john downey , who also took part in the police raid on the day of the shooting , testified that officer conroy had radioed for backup i heard , 'full pursuit , male black , blue jeans , third floor , ' he said he said he also heard officer conroy say , police , do n't move over the radio , followed by what sounded like muffled scuffling then there was nothing for a minute or two before shots were fired , officer downey said officer conroy then called for immediate assistance , telling other officers to get a bus , police shorthand for calling an ambulance , officer downey said he said that when he saw officer conroy later that night , he had a red mark on his nose and a red blemish under his left eye the prosecutor , armand durastani , tried to show inconsistencies in officer downey s account by reading a transcript from an interview given to investigators in the early morning hours after the shooting according to officer downey s account at that time , officer conroy radioed for backup and moments later asked for immediate assistance officer downey apparently made no mention of the police , do n't move declaration or the scuffling in that interview officer downey testified that he has known officer conroy since high school , when they played on competing baseball teams the two were partners on the police force , and he served as an usher at officer conroy s wedding officer conroy , wearing a dark pinstripe suit with an american flag lapel pin , appeared relaxed fourteen members of a staten island high school basketball team that he coached appeared in court to show

manila , july 22 american and philippine military forces have launched a joint operation to capture the leader of abu sayyaf , a small terrorist group that has kidnapped scores of people and beheaded several , including one american , united states and philippine military officials said this week the operation is in a marshy area on the island of mindanao , parts of which are controlled by the moro islamic liberation front , a separatist group that has been at war with the philippine government for two decades many american officials argue that the moro group also should be declared a terrorist organization in a departure from the past , however , the moro front is allowing the philippine army to operate in the region , since the two sides are now in peace talks , the officials said more important , a brigade of the group s formidable army is helping to block abu sayyaf s possible escape routes , said a philippine general who played a main role in planning the operation the general added , however , that the moro group was not aware that american forces were involved in the military operation , or else they would probably not have participated the general agreed to speak about the operation only on the condition that he not be identified because he was disclosing information that neither the united states nor the philippine governments wanted known publicly the current operation to capture the abu sayyaf leader , khaddafy janjalani , is part of a much larger effort to stop international terrorist organizations from using mindanao , much of which is covered by dense jungle , for training camps the moro group has long denied that it allows terrorist organizations train there al qaeda and its partner in southeast asia , jemaah islamiyah , an indonesiabased organization that carried out the attacks on bali nightclubs that killed more than 200 people in october 2002 , started using mindanao for a training area in the late 1990 s philippine military operations to shut down the camps have had only limited success , contrary to the claims of philippine officials islamic recruits are still coming to mindanao for training , probably 100 or so a year , american , australian and philippine officials said this week most of the terrorist recruits are indonesian , and are being sent by jemaah islamiyah , which also attacked the marriott hotel in jakarta in august 2003 an american military official , speaking on the condition that he not be further identified , said that the united states was providing intelligence and communications support for the current operation to capture mr janjalani , and that there were navy seal and army special forces units working in the area with the filipinos the american forces would not engage in combat , he said the american military has been operating on mindanao since early 2002 , ostensibly as part of training exercises , but there have been numerous reports that american forces have engaged in combat intelligence for this operation and earlier ones is coming from a p3orion surveillance aircraft that flies missions from its base in okinawa , and from small pilotless planes , commonly known as drones , american and philippine officials said the american official said the operation had already pinpointed the location of mr janjalani , and said that he could be captured within weeks the united states has offered a 5 million reward for his capture , but similar hopes in the past that he was about to be captured have been dashed during an attempt in june 2003 to free gracia and martin burnham , american missionaries who had been kidnapped by abu sayyaf , mr burnham was killed an estimated 80 to 90 american military personnel operate in the southern philippines , most of them in army special forces units , the american military official said villagers and human rights officials have reported that american troops have engaged in combat operations , and that former american soldiers now working under contract to the pentagon operate there none of these reports have been confirmed , however , and the pentagon has repeatedly denied that any americans are engaged in combat in the philippines

because of an editing error , an article on oct 27 about the fruit of the threatened moroccan argan tree , used to produce an oil for gourmet cooking and cosmetics , omitted a complete explanation of how exported argan oil is produced while some moroccans make oil from argan pits that have been excreted by grazing goats , none of those pits are used to make the oil that is exported because of that error , the article also carried a misleading headline while goats do climb argan trees to eat the fruit , they are not doing their bit for gourmands
here s some of the email on sunday s column , about left and right cooperating plenty of people were indignant that i had anything nice to say about evangelicals for example , alan from plainfield , nj , writes evangelicals stir the pot , destroy traditional societies , create cultural and economic divides , maintain poverty to enable good works , and try to unload their misguided deistic views on their wards can t we get this done without religion \? no , alan , i don t think so the fact is that in poor countries , conservative christians are making a huge and positive difference you get some american yuppie aid workers in the capitals , but when you find a clinic in the middle of nowhere in africa , it s likely to be run by and financed by a church in iowa or alabama one of my gripes is that new yorkers sit around wineandcheese parties bemoaning the situation in the third world , but they don t actually do much of anything about it i disagree with the religious right , but those are the folks who are contributing 10 percent of their incomes to charity and financing many of the schools , orphanages and hospitals in malawi or sierra leone and they deserve credit for that craig from watertown , mass , writes i ve been working for the last 18 months on an independent official history of the un development program that work has taken me to many of the worst places in the world i d put parts of sierra leone and liberia on the topfive list , ahead of burma , but that s a minor point one of the striking things in such place where us citizens are allowed to enter is that you find both very conservative christians and people very much on the left doing a lot of the unsung , and horrendously difficult , work needed to cope with disaster i have this sense that if the cultural divide in this country is ever bridged , it will be by people who met in bukuvu , darfur , banda aceh , and the like carl from west paterson nj , writes bill clinton was not just stingy with foreign aid and funding for eradication of diseases , he was stingy in all areas of government spending and tax policy that is one substantial reason that we had a declining deficits and then even a few years of surplus i am not disagreeing with spending money on these worthy causes , but from your column you would think that the evangelical right is much more concerned about the rest of the world than the progressive left that is not the case carl , i didn t mean to imply that conservatives are more supportive of foreign aid than liberals are the polling shows that democrats are still more supportive of humanitarian aid than republicans , but that the gap has narrowed sharply it used to be that republicans were overwhelmingly skeptical of aid now there s not so much of a gap nino from boise , idaho , writes about bush s 19 billion in aid do you know what percentage of this aid was military foreign aid \? and do you know what percentage of this aid is being withheld because countries will not sign on to the bilateral immunity agreement protecting the united states from any actions from the international criminal court \? nino , none of that is military aid it s all humanitarian and none is withheld the withholding is a real issue , and it certainly makes us look stupid around the world , but this is money actually spent on official development assistance bill from leominster , mass , writes you stated president bush has almost tripled actual spending on overseas development assistance the statement may be factually true but misrepresents the matter the congress , not clinton , determined the amount of foreign aid for much of the clinton presidency , both houses of congress were controlled by conservative republicans rememeber foreign aid under jesse helms \? you try to report the facts fairly the statement on president clinton was not fair there s something to that , bill the republican congress celebrated its 1994 victory by promptly slashing foreign aid by 10 percent but it s equally true that foreign aid was never a priority with clinton , and he never pushed hard to get more
washington , oct 14 a series of clashes in the last year between american and syrian troops , including a prolonged firefight this summer that killed several syrians , has raised the prospect that crossborder military operations may become a dangerous new front in the iraq war , according to current and former military and government officials the firefight , between army rangers and syrian troops along the border with iraq , was the most serious of the conflicts with president bashar alassad s forces , according to american and syrian officials it illustrated the dangers facing american troops as washington tries to apply more political and military pressure on a country that president bush last week labeled one of the allies of convenience with islamic extremists he also named iran one of mr bush s most senior aides , who declined to be identified because of the sensitivity of the subject , said that so far american military forces in iraq had moved right up to the border to cut off the entry of insurgents , but he insisted that they had refrained from going over it but other officials , who say they got their information in the field or by talking to special operations commanders , say that as american efforts to cut off the flow of fighters have intensified , the operations have spilled over the border sometimes by accident , sometimes by design some current and former officials add that the united states military is considering plans to conduct special operations inside syria , using small covert teams for crossborder intelligence gathering the broadening military effort along the border has intensified as the iraqi constitutional referendum scheduled for saturday approaches , and as frustration mounts in the bush administration and among senior american commanders over their inability to prevent foreign radical islamists from engaging in suicide bombings and other deadly terrorist acts inside iraq increasingly , officials say , syria is to the iraq war what cambodia was in the vietnam war a sanctuary for fighters , money and supplies to flow over the border and , ultimately , a place for a shadow struggle covert military operations are among the most closely held of secrets , and planning for them is extremely delicate politically as well , so none of those who discussed the subject would allow themselves to be identified they included military officers , civilian officials and people who are otherwise actively involved in military operations or have close ties to special operations forces in the summer firefight , several syrian soldiers were killed , leading to a protest from the syrian government to the united states embassy in damascus , according to american and syrian officials a military official who spoke with some of the rangers who took part in the incident said they had described it as an intense firefight , although it could not be learned whether there had been any american casualties nor could the exact location of the clash , along the porous and poorly marked border , be learned in a meeting at the white house on oct 1 , senior aides to mr bush considered a variety of options for further actions against syria , apparently including special operations along with other methods for putting pressure on mr assad in coming weeks american officials say mr bush has not yet signed off on a specific strategy and has no current plan to try to oust mr assad , partly for fear of who might take over the united states is not planning largescale military operations inside syria and the president has not authorized any covert action programs to topple the assad government , several officials said there is no finding on syria , said one senior official , using the term for presidential approval of a covert action program we 've got our hands full in the neighborhood , added a senior official involved in the discussion some other current and former officials suggest that there already have been initial intelligence gathering operations by small clandestine special operations units inside syria several senior administration officials said such special operations had not yet been conducted , although they did not dispute the notion that they were under consideration whether they have already occurred or are still being planned , the goal of such operations is limited to singling out insurgents passing through syria and do not appear to amount to an organized effort to punish or topple the syrian government according to people who have spoken with special operations commanders , teams like the army s delta force are well suited for reconnaissance and intelligence gathering inside syria they could identify and disrupt the lines of communications , sanctuaries and gathering points used by foreign arab fighters and islamist extremists seeking to wage war against american troops in iraq what the administration calls syria s acquiescence in insurgent operations organized and carried out from its territory is a major factor driving the white house as it conducts what seems to be a major reassessment of its syria policy the withdrawal of syrian troops from lebanon earlier this year in the wake of the assassination in february of rafik hariri , the former lebanese prime minister , in beirut led to a renewed debate in the white house about whether and how to push for change in damascus with no clear or acceptable alternative to mr assad s government on the horizon , the administration now seems to be awaiting the outcome of an international investigation of the hariri assassination , which may lead to charges against senior syrian officials detlev mehlis , the german prosecutor in charge of the united nations investigation of the killing , is expected to complete a report on his findings this month if mr mehlis reports that senior syrian officials are implicated in the hariri assassination , some bush administration officials say that could weaken the assad government i think the administration is looking at the mehlis investigation as possibly providing a kind of slowmotion regime change , said one former united states official familiar with syria policy the death syrian officials called it a suicide on wednesday of interior minister ghazi kanaan of syria , who was questioned in connection with the united nations investigation , may have been an indication of the intense pressure building on the assad government from that inquiry zalmay khalilzad , the united states ambassador to iraq , issued one of the administration s most explicit public challenges to damascus recently when he said that our patience is running out with syria syria has to decide what price it s willing to pay in making iraq success difficult , he said on sept 12 and time is running out for damascus to decide on this issue some hawks in the administration make little secret of their hope that mounting political and military pressure will lead to mr assad s fall , despite their worries about who might succeed him other american officials seem to believe that by taking modest military steps against his country , they will so intimidate mr assad that he will alter his behavior and prevent syrian territory from being used as a sanctuary for the iraqi insurgency and its leadership our policy is to get syria to change its behavior , said a senior administration official it has failed to change its behavior with regard to the border with iraq , with regard to its relationships with rejectionist palestinian groups , and it has only reluctantly gotten the message on lebanon the official added we have had people for years sending them messages telling them to change their behavior and they do n't seem to recognize the seriousness of those messages the hope is that syria gets the message there are some indications that this strategy , described as rattling the cage , may be working some current and former administration officials say that the flow of foreign fighters has already diminished because mr assad has started to restrict their movement through syria but while he appears to be curbing the number of foreign arab fighters moving through syria , the american officials say he has not yet restricted former senior members of saddam hussein s government from using syria as a haven from which to provide money and coordination to the sunnibased insurgency in iraq you see small tactical changes , which they do n't announce , so they are not on the hook for permanent changes , a senior official said about syria s response they are doing just enough to reduce the pressure in hopes we wo n't pay attention , and then they slide back again in an interview with cnn this week , mr assad denied that there were any insurgent sanctuaries inside syria there is no such safe haven or camp , he insisted in this tense period of give and take between washington and damascus , the firefight this summer was clearly a critical event it came at a time when the american military in iraq was mounting a series of major offensives in the euphrates valley near the syrian border to choke off the routes that foreign fighters have used to get into iraq the americans and iraqis have been fortifying that side of the border and increasing patrols , raising the possibility of firing across the unmarked border and of crossing it in hot pursuit from time to time there have been reports of clashes , usually characterized as incidental friction between american and syrian forces there have been some quiet attempts to work out ways to avoid that , but formal agreements have been elusive in an atmosphere of mutual mistrust some current and former united states military and intelligence officials who said they believed that americans were already secretly penetrating syrian territory question what they see as the bush administration s excessive focus on the threat posed by foreign arab fighters going through syria they say the vast majority of insurgents battling american forces are iraqis , not foreign jihadis according to a new study by the center for strategic and international studies , intelligence analysis and the pattern of detentions in iraq show that the number of foreign fighters represents well below 10 percent , and may well be closer to 4 percent to 6 percent of the total makeup of the insurgency one former united states official with access to recent intelligence on the insurgency added that american intelligence reports had concluded that 95 percent of the insurgents were iraqi this former intelligence official said that in conversations with several midcareer american military officers who had recently served in iraq , they had privately complained to him that senior commanders in iraq seemed fixated on the issue of foreign fighters , despite the evidence that they represented a small portion of the insurgency they think that the senior commanders are obsessed with the foreign fighters because that s an easier issue to deal with , the former intelligence official said it s easier to blame foreign fighters instead of developing new counterinsurgency strategies top pentagon officials and senior commanders have said that while the number of foreign fighters is small , they are still responsible for most of the suicide bombings in iraq gen john p abizaid , commander of united states central command , said on oct 2 on the nbc news program meet the press that he recognized the need to avoid hyping the foreign fighter problem but he cautioned that the foreign fighters generally tend to be people that believe in the ideology of al qaeda and their associated movements , and they tend to be suicide bombers so while the foreign fighters certainly are n't large in number , he said , they are deadly in their application
chris albrecht , the chairman of hbo , does not buy the widely heard argument that something has undermined his channel s former hold on viewers on sunday nights at 9 , something in the form of an abc show called desperate housewives for one thing , he dismisses the notion that hbo plays by the programming rules of the broadcast networks we ca n't get distracted by somebody s else s rules or scorecard , he said in a recent interview in his new york office hbo , he says , judges the success of its shows by criteria other than one night s rating , criteria that include subscriber totals \( up this year \) , videoondemand orders and even number of awards won for another , he points to what he feels is a deeper lineup of distinctive series on hbo , everything from the comedy entourage to the dramas deadwood and rome to the coming , suretobetalkedabout big love all of these , he insisted , have the stuff to emerge as worthy successors to hbo s hugely popular and awardladen shows like the sopranos and sex and the city but that does n't mean he has n't been paying attention to how desperate housewives has altered the sunday night landscape looking forward to the return of hbo s biggest gun of all time , the sopranos , in march , mr albrecht said he had been pondering a potential marketing plan , to center on a photograph to be shot by annie leibovitz , which would play off the billboard ad hbo used two years ago that ad featured the sopranos cast in a rowboat surrounded by the ghosts of the dead characters who had been rubbed out over the years would n't it be funny , mr albrecht said , if we did the same thing , and all the dead people in the water were the women from wisteria lane \? a reference to the lead characters of desperate housewives he added and the headline would be 'they 're back ! ' hbo was clearly elated \( and relieved \) when it concluded a deal with david chase , the creator of the sopranos , to extend that show beyond what had been expected to be its final 12 episodes , starting in march , to an additional minirun of eight episodes , beginning in january 2007 as usual with the sopranos , it has now been off the air a long time two years later can 'the sopranos' be as big as it was \? mr albrecht asked , another way of asking the broader question that he acknowledged had been thrown at hbo in the past year or so can hbo be as big as it was \? the question has arisen mainly because of ratings comparisons , which is how broadcast network shows are measured by that standard , there is no question that hbo is off its best results for sunday nights , when episodes of its series have their first showings that powerhouse abc series at 9 pm has to be a factor but mr albrecht disputes any notion that hbo is off its game i feel like we 've done the job we needed to do in programming , he said our audience has certainly moved off sunday nights to other points during the week as for rome , he said , hbo has been encouraged by the series' growth among viewers and by a second round of critical comments , which largely moved from tepid to enthusiastic in strict viewer terms , hbo calls rome a success because , while its sunday totals are not overwhelming , it accumulates more than 7 million viewers a week during its multiple showings mr albrecht announced only a couple of weeks into its run that he was renewing the series for another season but in the interview he said , that ship has n't entirely sailed yet the reason , he said , has nothing to do with how well rome turned out mainly , the issue has been money rome was wildly expensive , costing an estimated 100 million it initially experienced debilitating production delays , fueling rumors that it was a troubled show once it was on the air and was seen to be a quality production , mr albrecht said , those rumors subsided but he said those delays meant he had only a short window of time to retain a hold on the actors , which was why he renewed the series so quickly for now , that means ordering scripts , which will be difficult to write because they need to cover the complicated period following the fall of caesar the real reason why , even though i ordered the show , we have n't formally gone into production , is how long it s going to take , he said 'rome' wo n't be back until , at the earliest , march of 2007 which makes you say to yourself when i bring the show back , can i build an audience \? long interruptions have never cooled viewers' ardor for the sopranos , but mr albrecht acknowledged that those layoffs had not been ideal for scheduling part of the challenge for us is to figure a way to be a little more flexible , he said he is already demonstrating a bit of that flexibility , rethinking his plan to bring back the western drama deadwood in march at 10 pm on sundays following the sopranos now , mr albrecht said , he thinks the best move for the hbo s future would be to slot its new drama , big love , in that position to direct some of the hordes of sopranos fans to what he says he hopes will be hbo s next significant cultural phenomenon big love , a family drama like none other on television , deals with a regular american dad who happens to have three wives and families the issue of polygamy in the show , set in utah , is sure to stir debate , and hbo will be only too happy to be in the middle of it hbo loved the chatter that accompanied the run of the hollywood comedy entourage this year , a sign , hbo executives suggest , that the show may be about to take off the way sex and the city did after a couple seasons mr albrecht has ordered 20 more episodes of entourage in the meantime , mr albrecht defends hbo , saying it still sets much of the agenda for quality television you have seen the supposed successor to sex and the city' be on a broadcast network , he said , if indeed 'desperate housewives' is the successor , which i do n't believe creatively it is maybe from an audience point of view it is for mr albrecht , even that may be giving too much credit to the abc show that has sucked up so much audience during the hour formerly owned by hbo reemphasizing just how unconcerned he really is about that competitor , he noted the critical reaction to desperate housewives this season anybody who knows anything about television , he said , could look at that show and say two years , maybe three
for singleminded devotion to quality , purity and tradition , the trappist monks of belgium are hard to match , especially when it comes to ale it does n't take much imagination to get carried away picturing them at their work seated at their roughhewn tables , clothed in their coarse robes , they spend hours in the serenity of silent prayer and study then the word goes out it s time to brew the beer , it s time to brew the beer , and like so many keebler elves , off they go to perform their sacred chores pure fantasy , of course though they adhere to traditional styles , trappist breweries today are largely modern affairs , where the workers are often professionals hired by the abbeys they have computerized equipment and welldesigned web sites but the devotion remains to making ales as complex and distinctive as any in the world today , and , as the dining section s tasting panel discovered , their beers set a lofty standard the term trappist describes the source of these ales rather than a particular brewing style in fact , the beers vary considerably some are dark as chocolate stout and some are ambergold , bordering on orange they can be intensely sweet or dry enough to pucker sometimes they can be both , reaching a full , rich , complex sweetness as you turn the ale over in your mouth , yet turning dry and refreshing as you swallow they can all be wonderfully fragrant , with aromas of spices , flowers and fruit , and they are always strong , ranging in alcohol from about 7 percent to 12 percent , as opposed to the 5 percent of a typical lager producing trappist ales requires more than the usual sort of commitment only six breweries in the world , all affiliated with trappist monasteries in belgium , are permitted to use the hexagonal seal designating each bottle an authentic trappist product , and one of those six , the abbey of st sixtus at westvleteren , sells its beer only at its monastery a seventh trappist monastery , tegelen , in the netherlands , sells la trappe beer , but it is now made by a commercial brewer and no longer carries the trappist seal , which guarantees that the beer is brewed in an abbey under the supervision of the religious order , and that most of the income will be used for charitable work in the last few years , authentic trappist beers have become increasingly easy to get in the united states , even at corner delis that take beer seriously some of the brand names have become well known , especially chimay and orval they have been so admired that the trappist styles are now widely imitated dozens of belgian breweries make excellent versions of trappist ales some of them are even commissioned by monasteries to brew ales or are licensed to use a monastery name these are known as abbey beers north american craft brewers , likewise inspired by these beers , have made their own distinctive versions the panel tasted 25 ales , including bottles from the 5 exporting monasteries , 11 belgian abbey beers , 7 from the united states and 1 each from canada and the netherlands florence fabricant , frank j prial and i were joined by tony forder , copublisher and editor of ale street news , a consumer publication by the time the tasting was over , we were all feeling the spirit the quality of the beers was exceptionally high , which was surprising because so many were imported most beers are fragile if they are not protected from heat or light , they can easily lose their vitality they do n't take well to long voyages and are generally at their best as soon as they are bottled but trappiststyle ales are the rare beers that are meant to age they are generally what brewers call bottle conditioned , meaning that a small dose of sugar and yeast is added to each bottle just before it is sealed then , as with champagne , the beers referment in the bottle , developing complexity over time and a wonderful texture of pinpoint natural carbonation unlike the sediment in champagne , the ale s sediment is not removed before the bottles are sold it is left to settle to the bottom , and these unfiltered beers develop a soft haze they are at their best served cool , rather than cold as pleased as we were by the ales , we also disagreed considerably over which were our favorites , possibly because they were so stylistically varied the two bestknown trappist styles are dubbel and trippel , which i 've americanized to double and triple while these styles are never defined precisely , the doubles tend to be dark and rich , often with flavors of chocolate and mocha and a layer of fruity sweetness that can turn dry as you swallow the triples are lighter in color and body but stronger in alcohol , with complex spicy flavors usually they are dry there are even quadruples , which are stronger yet nonetheless , glorious exceptions to these categories exist , like the orval trappist ale , an unmatchable combination of the bitter austerity of a pilsener with the fullbodied richness of an ale it was one of my favorites in the tasting , and tony noted that it stuck out from the others but frank and florence found it merely routine other than the orval , we tended as a group to prefer the drier examples , like our consensus favorite , the deliciously complex and balanced triple from the westmalle trappist abbey , and our no3 , the spicy , refreshing affligem , an abbey triple our no2 , la fin du monde from unibroue in quebec , was also on the dry side yet with a pronounced , lively intensity all five of the trappist beers made our list , including the creamy , complex achel , the lightbodied , floral rochefort , and the grande r serve from chimay the chimay epitomized the divisions in our panel it was creamy and rich , with an aroma of roasted chocolate that struck me as beautiful it had flavors of dried fruit and spice and gave the impression of sweetness until it turned dry as you swallowed florence also liked it , suggesting that it would be great with a steak , but frank and tony were less impressed frank and i both loved the witkappater abbey triple ale , which i found complex , delicate and delicious , but tony and florence demurred perhaps i was n't critical enough , because there were few ales that i did not like , regardless of the style tony and i very much liked the southampton abbot , a dark ale that had brilliant flavors but florence and frank felt it was overwhelming it just missed making the list the only american beer in our top 10 was the weyerbacher from easton , pa , a complex , hefty quadruplestyle ale that was the strongest we tasted at 119 percent alcohol in addition to the southampton , american ales that narrowly missed out included the ommegang abbey ale and the victory golden monkey triple ale why is it that the monks have historically been able to make such great beer \? in his book , the brewmaster s table \( ecco , 2003 \) , garrett oliver suggests that not only were they patient , educated and thorough , but because of their lower costs , they were able to use better ingredients than commercial brewers no doubt that is all true , but i ca n't help imagining that somehow they get a little

greenburgh , ny , dec 13 larry brown has tinkered and tweaked , pushed and prodded and given 16 players a chance to make the knicks something better than substandard the result has been six victories in 20 games , so brown is preparing a new template starting wednesday night against the orlando magic , the lineup will be stable , the rotation shorter and the commitment almost entirely to youth at least , that is what brown declared tuesday he has changed his mind before a 20point rout by the milwaukee bucks on monday at madison square garden has put the knicks in soulsearching mode and prompted brown , who has used 14 starting lineups , to rethink his methodology there will probably be a 15th lineup wednesday , but this one should stick the guards will be stephon marbury and quentin richardson , joining channing frye at power forward and eddy curry at center brown did not specify who will be his small forward , but he indicated it would probably be trevor ariza i just think now i'm going to try to settle on a lineup a little bit more , settle on a rotation a little bit more and then hope by doing that , we see a little better continuity on both ends , brown said continuity has eluded the knicks since opening night three of their offseason acquisitions curry , richardson and jerome james have been injured and out of shape two veterans , antonio davis and penny hardaway , are breaking down brown used the openings to give playing time to the rookies frye and nate robinson and to experiment with roles i 've got a better feel of who should play together after watching , brown said he intends to cut the rotation to 9 or 10 players four guards , two small forwards and three to four big men nearly all of whom will be under age 30 the biggest change will come at small forward , where it appears brown is committing to his youngest options , ariza and the newly signed qyntel woods right now , it 'd be trevor and qyntel , brown said let the young kids play matt barnes opened the season at small forward but was injured he was cut last week to make room for woods brown has also used richardson , malik rose and david lee , none of whom are natural small forwards brown sounded enthusiastic about woods , a 24yearold former firstround pick , who was unemployed until last week woods played six minutes in his debut monday , scoring on a dunk and a 3pointer i do n't think he s in real good shape , and i think he does n't know exactly what we 're trying to do , but i love his athleticism , said brown , who later added , but i do n't think it s going to happen overnight for him brown said that he loved ariza s heart , but it s hard , he s not ready , in my mind , to be a starter in this league , but he comes to practice every day , he s getting better every day brown also concluded that richardson should not be a fulltime small forward , and that robinson and jamal crawford are best coming off the bench but the overriding , if unstated message , was this the knicks are fully committed to their youth movement , even at the expense of shortterm success on monday , they sent hardaway and davis to the inactive list and dropped rose from the rotation two other veterans , maurice taylor and james , each played only seven minutes , while 20yearold jackie butler played 10 minutes it would not be surprising if the knicks' next move was to activate lee , the only rookie who has yet to make an impact everything would change , however , if the knicks can make a deal for ron artest , indiana s disgruntled star forward , but that appears unlikely the knicks have quietly made it known that they will not part with frye , their best prospect , and they have yet to make the pacers an offer after the rout by the bucks , brown was hard on nearly everyone he criticized robinson s defense on t j ford and called out all of his point guards for poor decisionmaking he ripped his entire team for being lackadaisical and soft he wondered why no one seemed to grasp how to make an entry pass to the post he bemoaned the inexperience of curry , frye and robinson so with a quarter of the season gone , and the knicks looking like a long shot for the playoffs , brown is changing his role , too a little less mad professor , a little more remedial basketball teacher today was like training camp , brown said we are trying to teach them how to screen , how to block out , how to pass the game we called it a passing game , but still , the first thing guys want to do is dribble the ball instead of hitting the first open man we 've got to drill it and drill it and drill it rebounds while the indiana pacers field trade offers for ron artest , the knicks continue to monitor the situation from a distance i 've heard from 15 or 16 teams , but the knicks were not one of them , said donnie walsh , the pacers' chief executive there were some offers that were interesting penny hardaway was scheduled to have tests on his right knee , which has tendinitis , and his left quadriceps tuesday orlando s grant hill will make his season debut wednesday , six weeks after having surgery for a sports hernia the magic has gone 811 without hill
when it comes to food fights , john belushi s character in animal house has nothing on rick berman a prominent washington lobbyist , mr berman runs the center for consumer freedom , a nonprofit advocacy group that is financed by the food and restaurant industries two months ago , after a report in a leading medical journal cast doubt on several assumptions about obesity , he pounced his group ran 600 , 000 worth of fullpage ads in a halfdozen newspapers , gloating that the study showed that obesity was not an epidemic but rather a lot of hype americans have been forcefed a steady diet of obesity myths by the 'food police , ' trial lawyers , and even our own government , the ad said in recent years , mr berman , who is not a scientist , has emerged as a powerful and controversial voice in the debate over the nation s eating habits in some ways , he has become the face of the food industry as it tries to beat back regulations and discourage consumer lawsuits food and restaurant companies , he says , are being unfairly blamed for making americans fat and unhealthy he adds that people are smart enough to make their own wellinformed choices formed in 1995 with money from philip morris , now known as altria , to fight bans on smoking in restaurants and bars , consumer freedom has gained attention for its provocative tactics last year , it ran television ads that featured the soup nazi of seinfeld fame ordering overweight people to eat salad a clear jab at what the group considers pushy nutritionists who are trying to suck the joy out of eating mr berman has declared war on organizations like the center for science in the public interest , the food and nutrition activist group that is run by his nemesis , michael jacobson if the food police had a commissioner , mr berman would cast him in the role along the way , mr berman and his group have earned more than a few enemies critics say that consumer freedom seizes on statistical errors and other nuances to distract from the substance of the obesity debate they make a lot of noise , but nobody in academia takes their arguments seriously , said dr david ludwig , director of the obesity program at children s hospital in boston and an occasional target of mr berman s group they stand for food industry freedom , not consumer freedom amid the claims and counterclaims , mr berman and his opponents duke it out , taking sides on major questions about obesity , including these how did americans become so fat \? who is to be blamed \? and how should the problem be solved \? much is at stake in the answers in april , a study by researchers at the centers for disease control and prevention sharply lowered the number of annual deaths attributable to obesity , to 112 , 000 from 400 , 000 but the report , published in the journal of the american medical association , said nothing of other problems that can result from obesity scientists have linked the condition defined as having a body mass index of more than 30 to an increased risk of everything from diabetes and arthritis to hypertension and heart disease as a result , the cdc , the government s primary agency for health information , still calls obesity a very , very important health problem and a serious epidemic according to the agency , rates of obesity have doubled in the last 25 years among adults and children , and tripled among teenagers some scientists and public health officials have suggested that this trend , if left unchecked , could bankrupt the already faltering health care system a study last year by scientists at the research triangle institute and the cdc found that states' medical expenditures related to obesity were as much as 75 billion a year for the food industry , which has annual revenue of 500 billion , the implications of all this are potentially colossal many major food and restaurant companies derive a huge portion of their revenue from products cocoa puffs , doritos , hot pockets , you name it that most nutritionists frown upon only a handful of small lawsuits have been filed against food companies so far concerning diet and obesity , but trial lawyers are circling and are starting to turn food into the new tobacco part of mr berman s job is to keep that from happening to that end , he has taken aim at center for science in the public interest which , like consumer freedom , is based in washington because it has done more than anyone else to say the food industry has had a major role in obesity run for 30 years by mr jacobson , a tenacious phd in microbiology , the center for science in the public interest has consistently shined a bright light on the nutritional ills of the standard american diet last year it raised 16 million , mostly from subscribers to its monthly newsletter to mr jacobson , food companies have followed the profit motive , making bigger sizes to encourage people to spend more money , and engineering food that is full of sugar , fat and salt and thus has an irresistible taste as a result , he says , people have become fat to illustrate the point , he cites a study showing that many of the foods with the biggest increases in consumption in the last 20 years are among the most fattening and nutritionally unredeeming , such as salty snacks , pizza and soft drinks mr berman , on the other hand , argues that potato chips and hamburger combo meals have very little to do with america s ballooning waistline the real culprits , he says , are a lack of exercise and people s unwillingness to take personal responsibility for their own diets he points to separate studies showing that over the last two decades , the rates of exercise among american adolescents have decreased considerably , while total caloric consumption has risen only slightly not surprisingly , mr jacobson cites government data that show just the opposite that the average american consumed anywhere from 166 to 560 more calories a day in 2000 than in 1980 run from the wellappointed offices of mr berman s lobbying firm , berman company , the center for consumer freedom employs 25 people mr berman , trained as a lawyer , built a career working on labor issues he campaigned against the minimumwage increase in 1997 and worked as a negotiator for bethlehem steel in union contract talks before turning his attention to obesity in newspaper advertising , consumer freedom describes itself as a nonprofit organization dedicated to protecting consumer choices and promoting common sense but mr berman readily acknowledges that he gets the bulk of his funds from food and restaurant companies , some of which are also clients of his lobbying firm mr jacobson , who employs 60 people at his organization , says that because of the way mr berman s group is financed , consumer freedom is little more than a thinly veiled front for the interests of the food industry the companies that are working with them want their critics debunked and trashed , mr jacobson said recently from his washington office they can secretly participate in that by funding berman mr berman responds that his primary goal is to create an intellectually honest debate i'm trying to make sure the statistics are not made to seem worse than they are and to educate the public about how some people are being selective in their data , he said last month over a healthy lunch of grilled salmon at a restaurant not far from his 12thfloor offices overlooking the white house mr berman has always declined to name the specific companies that support consumer freedom he said in an interview that there were roughly 100 companies , including some that control very large brands , but that identifying them would serve no purpose i do n't want these companies getting targeted for something controversial that i'm saying , he said a watchdog group in washington , the center for media and democracy , has posted data about consumer freedom s financing on its web site according to documents they say were obtained from a former consumer freedom staff member , corporate contributors to the group as of 2002 included cocacola , wendy s and tyson foods , each of which gave 200 , 000 cargill gave 100 , 000 , according to the documents , and outback steakhouse gave 164 , 600 cocacola confirms that it is a sponsor of consumer freedom and calls the group valuable as another voice in the debate but a coke spokeswoman , kari bjorhus , added that her company does take the obesity issue very seriously the national restaurant association , which represents large chains like mcdonald s and wendy s as well as small , independent businesses , says that it is not a financial contributor to consumer freedom , but that the two organizations have similar goals we have regular communications with consumer freedom , said a spokeswoman , sue hensley they have an important voice in emphasizing personal responsibility not all food companies , however , are aligned in support of mr berman a situation that highlights a philosophical divide in the industry some companies , like pepsico and kraft foods , say that they have explicitly declined to work with consumer freedom and that they do not agree with some of its arguments or its approach our focus is not to engage in all the debate over whose fault it is , but to continue to work on healthier product development , said brock leach , a senior vice president at pepsico who in 2002 was given the task of helping to develop more nutritious product offerings a spokesman for kraft , mark berlind , says that the company does not contribute to consumer freedom because it does n't think fingerpointing is the right solution we feel we have a responsibility to address consumers' concerns over obesity , he added , so we 're responding by reformulating many of our products , providing more product information , creating smaller sizes and adjusting our marketing practices to mr berman , that is appeasement and will not work you ca n't accommodate these people , he said , referring to the center for science in the public interest they 're not going away if you create some healthier products , they 'll go after all the unhealthy ones you still make so in turn , consumer freedom goes after that group , as one prong of its strategy another is to become an authority on health and obesity information consumer freedom staff members post articles daily on its web site and publish booklets with titles like an epidemic of obesity myths , dense with statistics and references to scientific studies the booklets and articles make for interesting reading , but many scientists question whether much of it really matters for instance , mr berman says that arnold schwarzenegger , mel gibson and michael jordan all have body mass indexes above 30 and thus are classified as obese so , too , is mr berman at 6foot3 and 255 pounds , he has a body mass index of 3187 despite his obesity , mr berman says he is perfectly healthy these are useful points , but dr ludwig of children s hospital said that people like weightlifters and professional athletes who are technically overweight because of muscle constitute a very small percentage of the population and while it is certainly possible to have an index above 30 and still be healthy , that is not true for a majority of people who are obese dr glenn a gaesser , a professor of exercise physiology at the university of virginia and a supporter of many of the efforts of consumer freedom , says that roughly 30 percent of obese people have none of the classic metabolic problems or other risk factors the other 70 percent are indeed at risk for a host of troubling and costly obesityrelated health problems , he says one scientist who objects to consumer freedom s statistical nitpicking is katherine m flegal , a senior research scientist at the cdc s national center for health statistics and an author of the study in the journal of the american medical association that found fewer deaths linked to obesity i think people have overinterpreted a lot of what we said , dr flegal said in a recent interview just because you do n't have a risk of excess death does n't mean you 're healthy and for dr ludwig , the fact that the study s findings were less dire than previous studies does not shake his belief that there is a looming public health disaster dr flegal s study , for instance , did not directly address the sharp increase in childhood obesity once obese children enter adulthood , dr ludwig said , then all of the previous relationships that have been observed may no longer apply because they 'll be carrying those extra pounds for so many more years in other words , with regard to the childhood obesity epidemic , he added , we are still in the quiet before the storm mr jacobson says that it is shortsighted for consumer freedom to make such a big deal over the number of obesity deaths he contends that obesity is just one symptom of the prevalence of horrible diets , and that the same eating habits that cause people to gain weight may also deprive them of essential nutrients , antioxidants and fiber to help keep their bodies healthy and free from chronic disease it s all related , he said mr berman is undeterred by such criticism in fact , he thrives on it he calls dr ludwig a waistline scaremonger and says that mr jacobson has a messiah complex instead of easing up on its criticism of the cdc for having to change the figure on obesity deaths , consumer freedom is turning up the dial using internal cdc documents the agency posted on its web site , the group recently completed a report that accuses the cdc of deliberately inflating its statistics and covering up that it has done so the cdc said it did not want to comment on that report and the group is planning a new television commercial assailing the food police the ad shows a hand yanking an ice cream cone away from a little boy and grabbing a beer away from a guy at a bar do you ever feel like you 're always being told what not to do \? the ad says find out who s driving the food police at consumerfreedomcom to mr berman , nothing less than the vitality of the food industry and the personal freedom of all americans are at stake there are attempts to create illconceived regulations at the state level and there will certainly be rogue lawyers filing obesity lawsuits against companies , he said and if michael jacobson has his way there will be a tax on every food product that is not a vegetable we ca n't let that happen correction june 19 , 2005 , sunday an article last sunday about the center for consumer freedom , an advocacy group financed by the food and restaurant industries , misidentified the headquarters city of the center for media and democracy , a group that has posted data about consumer freedom s financing on its web site it is madison , wis , not washington
washington , may 31 as she prepares to run for reelection next year , and perhaps make a presidential run in 2008 , senator hillary rodham clinton is counting on the counsel of a tightknit group of advisers who possess a set of qualities that she may prize above all others discipline and loyalty leaks \? public skirmishes \? none of this tends to happen in hillaryland , as mrs clinton s advisers call the inner circle , mostly because the people who have gained entry into this exclusive club have shown strict devotion to her through the years , including her darkest days in public life in fact , political strategists say they are struck by the similarities between mrs clinton s inner circle and the team surrounding president bush , who has placed a premium on loyalty since his days as governor of texas and whose lieutenants are known for falling in lockstep behind him both operations make the papal conclave look like a bunch of free talkers , said chris lehane , a democratic strategist , referring to the bush and clinton camps i mean that in a positive way , because that is the type of discipline it takes to win but perhaps as interesting is the fact that the culture that dominates mrs clinton s political organization is strikingly different from the rollicking atmosphere that seemed to characterize her husband s administration , where turf battles were common and top aides frequently served up morsels of news to reporters to promote their agenda and consolidate power bill clinton led a political team that , while battletested and successful , could sometimes function as an allnight idea session with thoughts being tossed out as trial balloons and internal debates erupting publicly but as mrs clinton , the junior senator from new york , moves to establish her own orbit in american government and politics , associates of the couple say that her husband s style runs contrary to what they describe as her cautious and deliberate nature the difference between the two operations is really the difference between bill and hillary , said one democratic strategist who spoke on the condition of anonymity , citing the subject s delicate nature whereas bill clinton publicly agonized over every decision he made , hillary is more discreet and private still , mr clinton , regarded as one of the most skilled politicians of his generation , is still mrs clinton s most important source of advice , the couple s closest associates say and beyond that , her inner circle does include a small number of people who have chiefly acted as his advisers through the years , among them john podesta , mr clinton s last chief of staff but many of the people who played central roles in her husband s operation paul begala , stanley greenberg , doug sosnik and joe lockhart , just to name a few are not among the team involved in making daily decisions for mrs clinton s organization , according to her associates one person whose role is not yet clear , according to campaign associates , is harold m ickes , who was a senior official in the clinton white house mr ickes , a canny political operative from new york , was one of the first people mrs clinton turned to in 1999 when she started mulling a senate run but these days , mr ickes has no direct hand in her operation , partly because he has been involved with one of the many independent political groups that federal campaign laws prohibit from working with the campaigns of candidates in general , mrs clinton s cadre of advisers works so completely behind the scenes they will not , for instance , even discuss how often they meet to discuss strategy that it is hard to determine the full extent of their influence her advisers say that keeping these matters confidential gives mrs clinton the benefit of candid advice from people who do not worry that what they say will end up in the newspaper the next day the strict devotion that mrs clinton engenders may stem from the fact that her advisers genuinely like her and describe working for her not so much as a job as a cause she s been loyal to all of us , said mandy grunwald , mrs clinton s media strategist , who joined the clintons more than a decade ago as an adviser to mr clinton s 1992 presidential campaign that does n't just mean we 've kept our jobs that means that in good and bad moments in our personal life she s been there she s won our loyalty but a harsher explanation for the camp s cohesiveness is that mrs clinton s top lieutenants do not tolerate anyone who goes off message , risking a spoken word that might be viewed as unflattering to mrs clinton an inquiry from a reporter , for example , could trigger a round of discussions among her advisers , who , in turn , debate how to respond this is not your typical democratic operation , a democratic strategist said they recognize the importance of speaking with one voice , and they do n't tolerate anyone going off the reservation no list of insiders is complete without maggie williams , mrs clinton s chief of staff in the white house dick morris , a former adviser to mr clinton , once described ms williams as the only person who could give the first lady advice without getting scalped for it there is another member of the group who , like ms williams , is said to have a close relationship with mrs clinton cheryl mills , a lawyer whose time in the white house counsel s office culminated with her defense of the president during his impeachment trial in 1999 mrs clinton is also said to turn to evelyn s lieberman , the former white house deputy chief of staff who ordered the intern with whom mr clinton had an affair out of the white house to a job in the pentagon , citing her immature behavior and poor job performance at the top of the political apparatus is patti solis doyle , who got her start as mrs clinton s scheduler about 14 years ago these days , mrs doyle runs mrs clinton s political operation , overseeing the senator s fundraising , travel and speeches two others with long years of service are mark penn , a pollster for both clintons , and ann lewis , the communications director for mrs clinton s political operation and a longtime democratic strategist with deep roots in the party s traditional constituency groups there is also howard wolfson , a relative newcomer to the clinton team , who was brought on board in 1999 to run the media operation for her senate campaign another influential figure is karen persichilli keogh , mrs clinton s state director , who serves as the senator s eyes and ears in new york if mrs clinton and her advisers seem excessively cautious and wary of outsiders , they have plenty of reason to be while the republican party is having a hard time recruiting a toptier candidate to take her on in 2006 , the clinton camp cannot afford to take anything for granted , because she may turn out to be the no 1 target of republicans in 2008
can a company s interest in protecting corporate secrets trump any privilege protecting the identity of a reporter s sources \? that is the question avoided by the judge who is overseeing the lawsuit filed by apple computer to learn who disclosed details of a forthcoming product on various web sites in an opinion issued earlier this month , judge james p kleinberg of the santa clara county superior court in san jose , calif , allowed apple to issue a subpoena to the email service provider for one of the web sites the decision attracted considerable attention and was criticized for undermining the ability of online and traditional reporters to protect their sources the electronic frontier foundation , which filed a brief in the case , splashed a headline on its web site stating , court crushes online journalists' rights but judge kleinberg carefully and explicitly did not address the journalistic questions in his opinion , writing , the order of this court does not go beyond the questions necessary to determine this motion seeking a protective order against that single subpoena , and it cannot and should not be read or interpreted more broadly instead , the judge wrote that the disclosed information is stolen property , just as any physical item , such as a laptop computer containing the same information on its hard drive what is more , he determined , there was no compelling public interest in the disclosure unlike the whistleblower who discloses a health , safety , or welfare hazard affecting all , or the government employee who reveals mismanagement or worse by our public officials , he wrote , the operators of the web sites are doing nothing more than feeding the public s insatiable desire for information about apple but drawing a line between what is whistleblowing and what is a legitimate trade secret the stolen property asserted by apple is not so easy some lawyers and journalists worry that the decision , if it survives appeal , will pave the way for more lawsuits against online commentators as well as traditional news organizations , arguing that whatever is disclosed deserves legal protection to have him assert this is a trade secret opens up an exception that swallows the rule , said susan crawford , an assistant professor at the benjamin n cardozo school of law who was involved in litigation over trade secrets when she was in private practice the rough idea here is anything that is kept secret and has economic value because it is kept secret is a trade secret the critical question , dealt with briefly on page nine of the decision , is what is the public good served by protecting the misappropriation of trade secrets \? and the answer , the judge concludes , is that there is none focusing on that question , however , allowed the judge to sidestep the question of whether those on the web sites that disclosed apple s product details were journalists and eligible to claim any privilege in the first place , either under federal law or california s shield law although judge kleinberg distinguished new product information from the whistleblower who reveals that a company is polluting the public water supply , his decision does not spell out when disclosure of a secret may serve a sufficiently great public interest to justify a reporter s protecting the identity of the person who revealed it it suggests that not just for online journalists but for all journalists , the rules are different when you 're talking about trade secrets , said deirdre mulligan , director for the samuelson law , technology and public policy clinic at boalt hall school of law at the university of california , berkeley and it also constructs a fairly narrow notion of what s in the public interest ms crawford said she sympathized with the judge s effort to avoid deciding who was a journalist and what kind of protection a journalist might claim but by resting the decision so heavily on what is a trade secret , she added , to stay out of the circus , he s jumped into the swamp
tampa , fla some members from baseball s expanding band of incredibly shrinking players will most likely arrive at spring training camp in a private panic this week wondering , who am i without the juice \? but just who will suffer more from steroid detox this season \? those players or their management \? former users or exenablers \? in its totality , the serial 'roid revelations over the past week have created suspicions that a system of winkwinks and pinkie swears among stars , management and agents has existed through the last minute of baseball s unpoliced steroid era selective ignorance of illicit doping has never looked more like tacit approval of steroids the players union boss , don fehr , has never seemed to have more company in his role as drugpolicy obstructionist in reaction to jose canseco s payforpage confessions in the book juiced wild times , rampant 'roids , smash hits and how baseball got big , the genius manager tony la russa all but described mark \( andro \) mcgwire as a grainfed hulk assembled without the hocus pocus of chemicals then la russa misplaced the lessons from his law school days by exhibiting too much evidence as he went on to explain how he heard canseco openly joke about using steroids so everyone knew \? just like canseco said \? if so , then canseco has reason to believe baseball s inner circle including his former rangers employer in texas , george w bush must have known who was on what and what was on first of course , any appearance of culpability can be rationalized as so 80 s and 90 s if not for the yankees' recent entry in baseball s do n'task , do n'ttell debate last week , the times s murray chass disclosed how handy the yankees were with an eraser in december 2001 when deleting the word steroids in jason giambi s 120 million deal the yankees say other contractual language was in place to guard against giambi s illegal use of drugs perception says the yankees ignored the red flag and suspicions to procure an inflated slugger for an outsized owner i'm not saying it does n't look bad , rob manfred , major league baseball s chief labor executive , said in a telephone interview yesterday i'm saying as a legal matter , they had language that protected them baseball often seeks protection over its past , but it never seeks transparency if mcgwire or giambi or anyone accused of steroid use by canseco is willing to open himself up for full disclosure in court , he can pursue legal action against his old teammate bet is , none will if baseball wants to discover the genesis of the steroid era including who supplied drugs , who pressured whom to take them , who in management was an accessory commissioner bud selig could launch an independent investigation into what went wrong bet is , it 'll never happen with respect to behavior in the past , we did n't have a drug policy , manfred explained he is obviously right , but selfexamination does n't mean baseball has to scrap the records and taint the players there are instructional purposes how better to foresee the next generation of illegal performance enhancers as in the creepy science of genetic engineering than to understand the runup to the 'roid rage \?

they were drawn from their apartment by the wonder and roar of falling rock and trees but standing on a footbridge outside their apartment building at 1380 riverside drive , elizabeth umpierre and her cousin had only a moment to gaze at the landslide that buried the roadway below a minute or two later , a firefighter grabbed them by the hair , and yelled at them to run as fast as they could suddenly , a second cascade of stone and trees washed down the hillside over cars and onto the henry hudson parkway beneath their feet we did not have time to think , said ms umpierre , 24 we were like , 'oh my god , what is happening \?

east rutherford , nj , dec 17 a few days before his team s game against the kansas city chiefs , giants running back tiki barber was asked why he was not frequently mentioned as an nfl most valuable player candidate i do n't know why i'm not , said barber , uncharacteristically lost for words i do n't know i think people still believe it s hard , hard , hard to change perceptions , and unfortunately perception is reality i think in a lot of people s minds i'm still this thirddown back that s not durable enough and i fumble too much during the giants' 2717 victory over the chiefs , barber , the league s leader in yards from scrimmage , not only set a franchise record with 220 rushing yards , he carried the giants to a 104 record and the verge of a division title for the first time in five years it has always been , 'tiki barber is a great running back , but ' center shaun o'hara said i think after today , you can erase the 'but' the chiefs had not allowed a 100yard rusher in 20 consecutive games near the end of barber s performance , his fifth game in a row with more than 100 yards , many in the crowd at giants stadium chanted , tiki , tiki others chanted , mvp , mvp we throw the ball a lot , barber said but when it comes down to it , we are an ontheground , grinditout , getthetoughyardage type of team the giants need to win only one of their final two regularseason games , at washington next saturday or at oakland on dec 31 , to clinch the national football conference east division that would guarantee at least one playoff game at giants stadium , where the team is 81 , including a road game against the new orleans saints after hurricane katrina but the victory did not come without suspense or unseen obstacles preparing to face the leading offense in the league and its mostprolific rusher in recent weeks , larry johnson , the giants arrived saturday to learn that linebacker carlos emmons would not play his pectoral muscle was so sore he could not extend his arm with the linebacker corps already without middle linebacker antonio pierce , the giants were forced to start the rookie chase blackburn , with no nfl starts and no nfl tackles on anything but special teams , in the middle the chiefs , predictably , ran the ball at the missing heart of the giants' defense , which also played without the injured starting defensive tackle william joseph on the chiefs' first play from scrimmage , johnson ran up the middle for 10 yards it was a sign of things to come johnson ran through the giants for 167 yards and 2 touchdowns but could not outrun barber while not as consistently proficient as johnson , barber ran as if occasionally drizzled in cooking oil he broke through logjams and slipped through the grasp of wouldbe tacklers although 30 pounds lighter than johnson , barber wore down the chiefs , with the help of the giants' offensive line , which was also missing two of its starters the game that tiki had was just incredible , giants coach tom coughlin said after the chiefs tied the game , 1010 , on a knifethroughbutter drive to open the third quarter , barber rushed for 151 more yards johnson had 58 it s just an honor to be playing with a guy like him , fullback jim finn said the guy just keeps proving to people , day in and day out , that he is an every down back he is an mvp , too barber has 1 , 577 rushing yards this season , breaking the giants' singleseason record he set in 2004 his two rushing touchdowns gave him 49 in his career , tying rodney hampton atop the franchise list the teams traded startandstop possessions in the first quarter , every drive managing at least one first down before stalling outside of fieldgoal range but as the teams threatened to wear out the middle of the field , the chiefs increasingly fed the ball to johnson , including 10 times on a clockmilking 14play drive early in the second quarter reaching firstandgoal at the giants' 3yard line , the chiefs handed the ball to johnson on three straight plays different giants end osi umenyiora , tackle kendrick clancy and linebacker nick greisen took turns bringing him down short of the goal line on fourthandgoal at the 1 , the chiefs settled for a lawrence tynes field goal the chiefs had the points the giants had the confidence and it seemed to spread to the struggling offense , as the giants embarked on a scoring drive of their own after converting a couple of third downs , and having reached kansas city s 41yard line , quarterback eli manning pitched left to barber , who cut back in to avoid one wouldbe tackler , then back to the outside he shed tacklers as if they were uncomfortable coats four chiefs grabbed enough of barber to slow him down , but none tightly enough to prevent him from spinning away if the official score clock is to be believed , it took barber , with all his fits and starts , 8 seconds to go 41 yards to the end zone the giants' defense got the ball back quickly when cornerback curtis deloatch forced a fumble after a reception by samie parker placekicker jay feely s 41yard field goal gave the giants a 103 halftime lead backtoback highlightworthy runs by barber in the third quarter put the giants in fieldgoal position again as has been their habit in recent weeks , the giants stalled when in sight of the end zone , and feely kicked a 35yard field goal to give them a 1310 lead with 48 seconds left in the third the giants broke that habit when they needed to early in the fourth , receiver amani toomer took a short pass from manning , then spun out of the tackle of cornerback sammy knight and ran 20 yards to the end zone after johnson s 1yard touchdown pulled the chiefs to 2017 before the midway point of the fourth quarter , the giants leaned even more heavily on barber on a 10play scoring drive , barber caught a short pass on a thirdand3 play and ran the ball six times the last , with 2 minutes 48 seconds left , was a 20yard touchdown run that gave barber 213 rushing yards , 5 yards shy of the franchise record set by gene roberts in 1950 minutes later , as the giants ran out the clock , barber broke the mark the chants began the playoffs grew closer extra points bob sheppard called his last game after 50 years as the giants' public address announcer he is retiring from the giants , he has said , because he has grown weary of the traffic he will still work as the yankees' announcer , which he has been for 55 years

if i had n't called my exhusband the last time a beatle died , i would n't have had to do anything but i did track him down after george harrison died in november 2001 , which is when he learned that i was living in new york , which is when he asked me to take a letter to strawberry fields in central park and place it there with a single candle how am i going to get the letter \? i asked i 'll email it to you , he responded i could have taken the letter to central park that day the park was within walking distance of my office instead , i carried it in and out of the subway for days , wondering how on earth i was actually going to do what my exhusband had asked me to do it s not because he loved the beatles that i had loved him and thought i could spend the rest of my life with him it s not that he was a track star or that he had blue eyes or that he was handsome and sweetlooking it s not that his parents were the only people i knew who were still married it s not that it was hard to fall in love with the gentlest boy i had ever known it was because he was a special kind of different , not the kind who congregated with his friends in hallways and parking lots discussing the feeblenesses of others that was part of why i thought i could spend the rest of my life with him , the boy who became my best friend , the boy from a family where nobody gets divorced i even thought i could spend the rest of my life with someone who listened to the beatles too much i tried to grow to love them , i honestly did , but it never really happened in those years , the late 70 s , there was plenty of other music around peter frampton , the commodores , the soundtrack to mahogany but my husband did n't listen to my songs instead , i listened to his every beatles album over and over i figured that s what true love was , when you loved someone even when he played too many beatles records too many times when we heard the beatles on the radio , i asked him why we bothered listening to them on the radio when we listened to their albums all the time he said it was so we could hear them at the same time other people were hearing them even when we moved from kansas to california in a uhaul , it was one beatles track after the other if it was n't abbey road , it was the white album , and if it was n't the white album it was revolver the volume kept going up and up every time the radio played one of his favorite beatles songs , which were pretty much all of them i knew that i loved this man and wanted to spend the rest of my life with him what i did n't know was that most things change after you marry your high school sweetheart and for us , just about everything changed our jobs or lack thereof , our apartments , our cars , our wall hangings , our haircuts , our arguments , our love but my husband s love for the beatles never changed a few days after george harrison died , i said yes when a friend invited me upstate to her country house for the weekend the guests would include a french friend we knew from the time we all lived in paris as we drove north to the catskills , i said nothing about the letter tucked away in my backpack the last time the three of us had been together was in paris , where our french friend still lived he still had good looks and his sense of humor , he still talked with french seriousness , and he still called what he had hiv , although his legs called it aids he walked as if he had no trouble putting one foot in front of the other , and when he fell , he stood up quickly , even when his legs begged him not to it was already another flawless weekend in the country the first snow began to fall when the apples were still on their trees for 36 hours inside and outside the farmhouse , we talked about everything under stars that could actually be seen i succeeded in keeping my strawberry fields dilemma to myself until we found ourselves in black horse farms , a store in the town of athens , which is where my friends found me in the candle section , which is where they asked me why i was buying a single candle i finally told them about my exhusband s letter and what he had asked me to do with it i knew both of them well , and i figured i knew what their reaction would be , but i was wrong they wanted to go with me and so it was arranged that the three of us would stop at central park on the way back to the city as we drove south , we watched the sun go down then there was fog , then the park when we arrived , i suggested that my friends wait in the car but all our car doors opened as the mist was coming down it was not quite nighttime , although the sun had set long before instead , there was a glow , a central park glow i was a little nervous but there i was entering central park on behalf of my former family , my husband of 20 years ago , the sweet boy with whom i had planned my entire life , and there i was with two unlikely members of the unlikely family i had never thought about planning we continued forward , but because none of us had been there before , we did n't know what we were looking for finally we saw a few people , quiet souls , along with other letters and other candles that had been deposited in a place called strawberry fields , in the gray mosaic circle called imagine the three of us walked around the circle together , wondering where the best place would be for my exhusband s letter then they stepped back as i laid the letter on the circle of stones we lighted the candle , stayed a moment or two , then turned to leave to say we all said some kind of prayer might be an exaggeration , but there were thoughts my sweet lord kind of thoughts as we left the park , above the light and the trees , we saw the same building in the same moment the dakota the three of us continued walking , and the mist continued misting on our way home , we stopped at times square to buy some cd s that night , we did n't talk as much as we listened other people listened with us too , and although i had listened to strawberry fields over and over before as an inexperienced lover , i must have heard it for the first time that night a few days later , i heard strawberry fields again on the radio my exhusband was right it s better to hear something you love on the radio , because when you 're listening , other people are listening too new york observed johanna baldwin s play adolph yolanda will have its debut in london in the spring

phillipsburg , nj , sept 6 the bell was like a starting pistol , and as soon as it went off , the students came flying around the corner , their sneakers squeaking on the freshly waxed floor , their eyes on the prize a place in the hotlunch line because of overcrowding , the lunch period at phillipsburg high school has been reduced to a chaotic 23 minutes , and if students time it right factoring in the lines , the crowds and the sprint from their mobile classrooms they figure they have about five minutes to eat you sit down , you eat , you leave , said jon gregory , a senior that s the deal it s like being in college it s all business here for many new jersey students , tuesday was the first day of school , and it served as a reminder of the litany of problems , big and small , never addressed by a troubled statewide school construction program that abruptly canceled more than 200 school projects this summer after running out of money for them even though phillipsburg s red brick high school has a certain happy days charm , with its checkerboard floors and limegreen drinking fountains , school officials said it was outdated , too small and desperately needed to be replaced in july , administrators here were stunned to learn that money for a new high school had suddenly disappeared , after bulldozers had cleared land and begun to build a road to the site phillipsburg officials now call that road the road to nowhere new jersey enjoys a reputation for good schools , but the reality is that thousands of students are still stuck in trailers or packed classrooms , still playing in gyms with leaky roofs and still checking out books from cubiclesize libraries in one threestory school in jersey city that was supposed to be replaced , the only bathrooms are in the basement , so that children have to trudge up and down six flights of stairs to use the toilet in one district near camden , there are so many students in trailers that school officials halfjokingly talked about putting up tents the situation has been this bad for years , which is why state officials , under court order , created the school construction corporation in 2002 and entrusted it with 86 billion raised through the sale of bonds to build schools , especially in the state s needy urban areas the agency has built 30 schools , and some have even won design awards but it will end up finishing fewer than half of the projects expected , and recent investigations have found that millions of dollars were wasted on excessive bonuses , exorbitant fees and design errors this disaster is like the new orleans of new jersey , said richard shapiro , a lawyer who is suing state officials on behalf of 12 school districts it s a total lack of planning and preparation for something everyone knew was an eventuality it could have been averted with proper planning state school officials say that what happened was the result of two things not enough money at the outset and rapidly escalating costs our role is to alleviate overcrowding , and we have done that in a number of places but unfortunately we did not have the funding to alleviate all of the overcrowding that exists , said kevin mcelroy , a spokesman for the school construction corporation crunch time came this summer , when state school officials realized their pot of money was about to run out and had to decide which school projects under way would continue they chose 59 schools to go forward , and brought 207 planned projects to a halt phillipsburg officials had been banking on getting a new 88 million high school seven years ago , they secured a site for the school in some cornfields just outside of town phillipsburg is about 70 miles west of new york city , in the hills along the pennsylvania border it used to be a thriving factory town , but it took a dive when the heavy industry moved away now it is enjoying something of a renaissance , with housing developments sprouting up this has led to a flood of new students , which has overwhelmed the town s only high school , built in 1926 there are now 31 trailers containing classrooms on the property , still not enough because the school continues to have classes with more children than permitted under state guidelines for the past 18 months , phillipsburg officials have been meeting with state school officials every two weeks to discuss the new high school we followed every turn in the yellow brick road , said gordon pethick , phillipsburg s superintendent we did everything we were supposed to and then they pulled the rug out of us mr mcelroy , the school agency s spokesman , said it was unfortunate that we were not able to accommodate them or several other districts newark also has an overcrowding problem in some sixthgrade classrooms , there are more than 33 students the state average is 22 the problem is especially acute in the city s fastgrowing east ward but this summer , newark officials learned that of the five projects that had been approved to go forward in the city , after 11 were canceled , none were in the east ward we were shocked , said raymond lindgren , executive assistant to newark s schools superintendent every school in the east ward predates 1900 , and every school in the east ward is overcrowded dr lindgren said he could not find any logic to the list of which projects made the cut and which did not we begged to be part of the decisionmaking process but we were turned down , he said several other local school officials from around the state said the same thing mr mcelroy said local districts were consulted years ago when they submitted longterm plans but their input was not sought in the final round of decisions that was n't the process , he said mr shapiro , the lawyer suing the state on behalf of 12 districts , said many of the problems could have been averted if the state education commissioner had informed the legislature each year on the progress of school construction , as required by state law but that never happened according to kathryn forsyth , director of communications for the new jersey department of education , william l librera , the current commissioner , never filed any updates ms forsyth declined to say why , adding that the matter is part of a lawsuit contesting canceled projects mr shapiro said the finances of the school agency were a mess what they kept doing is approving projects and working on projects without knowing how much money is out there , he said it did n't make any sense at phillipsburg , students say they have gotten used to the short lunches , the packed hallways and the peeling paint that sometimes falls off the ceiling of their vintage auditorium in flakes the size of note cards actually , they say , the statewide school woes have even brought some benefits to tell you the truth , i like the trailers better than the classrooms , said blair decker , a junior the trailers have airconditioning , and on a hot day that s beautiful
anaheim , calif , oct 10 the glory years are long gone , fading deeper into memory each fall the yankees spoiled themselves , their fans and their principal owner by winning four championships in five seasons through 2000 now , they have gone five years without one the second half of the joe torre era ended with a thud at angel stadium on monday the 203 million yankees , the most expensive baseball production ever assembled , left the october stage after one act the los angeles angels thwarted the yankees , 53 , in game 5 of their american league division series , rattling mike mussina with a barrage of soft hits and knocking him out in the third inning the yankees were helpless to fight back against the angels' stingy bullpen , and they have nothing to show for their season but another division title it should n't be satisfying for anyone , said derek jeter , the team captain , who homered for the yankees' only run over the last seven innings we do n't play just to make it to the playoffs we 've been to the playoffs before we play to win we came up short the yankees had the tying run on base with two out in the ninth , but angels first baseman darin erstad dove to his right to stop a grounder by hideki matsui , then flipped to closer francisco rodriguez , who barely beat matsui to the bag for the final out fireworks exploded , toilet paper streamed from the upper deck and the angels mobbed one another matsui stood alone down the firstbase line , overcome by the sobering notion that it would be the angels , not the yankees , flying to chicago to face the white sox in game 1 of the al championship series on tuesday matsui was 0 for 5 on monday , leaving eight runners on base if i had hit in those opportunities , maybe the game would have been a little different , matsui said through an interpreter it s a bitter feeling the yankees flew home to an uncertain future in which not even torre s status as manager is assured george steinbrenner , the everimpatient principal owner , had put the fate of the series in torre s hands my feelings are deep disappointment , torre said , adding that this year s defeat felt worse than last year s alcs collapse to boston i do n't remember being this disappointed , because i wanted this very badly i guess that s why you 're in the game it s just it s tough it s tough steinbrenner will surely assign blame somewhere for the yankees' latest postseason defeat , their second in four years to the angels in the first round a team with a much deeper pitching staff stifled some of the yankees' biggest hitters , and steinbrenner will want to know why alex rodriguez went 2 for 15 in the series , grounding into a double play after jeter s leadoff single in the ninth matsui was 4 for 20 over all gary sheffield had six hits in the series , none for extra bases each has been added since the last world series title , but the yankees are still waiting to win again we played so well down the stretch , rodriguez said to end in this fashion , it s disappointing i played great baseball this year , and i played like a dog the last five games in game 5 , the yankees could not capitalize on an early gift the departure of angels starter bartolo col n , who may win the al cy young award but who left the game in the second with an inflamed right shoulder the matchup of col n , a 21game winner this season , and mussina , a 224game winner in his career , was glitzy only on paper col n had complained of back and arm problems in new york over the weekend , and mussina missed three weeks in september with elbow trouble neither lasted long col n left after six pitches in the second inning , and the angels killed mussina softly in the third col n looked strong enough in the first , buzzing a 95mileanhour fastball past matsui with two runners on , ending the inning but after his third pitch of the second inning , col n was visibly anguished , pacing around the mound and needing a visit from the trainer he tried to stay in , but after three more pitches , the angels replaced him with ervin santana , a hardthrowing rookie righthander who was not sharp at first he threw ball four to robinson cano , then walked the next two hitters a oneout single by bubba crosby and a sacrifice fly by jeter drove in two runs , but rodriguez struck out to end the inning with crosby at second with a 20 lead , mussina immediately started giving it back he had stayed behind when the series shifted to new york , throwing to the yankees' bullpen catcher on a local field , but the rest did not seem to make much difference this was the shortest of mussina s 20 career postseason starts garret anderson led off the bottom of the inning with a home run over the tall wall in rightcenter , and bengie molina dumped the next pitch to left for a single after two outs , mussina was a pitch from escaping the inning with the lead intact he ran a full count to steve finley but walked him , staring at the homeplate umpire , joe west , after ball four the 32 pitch was a ball , mussina said , measuring his words but i did n't think joe had his best game it was a costly walk for mussina , because the next hitter , adam kennedy , launched a high drive to the wall in rightcenter crosby and sheffield converged on it crosby plays an aggressive center field , hustling to the point of recklessness at times he crashed into sheffield just as the ball appeared to hit sheffield s wrist , and it bounced away for a triple as two runs scored it was 32 angels , and the yankees never regained the lead sheff said he thought , right at the last second , that he was going to catch it , and i thought at the last second that i was going to catch it , crosby said , while declining to answer who called for the ball it was perfectly placed now it was santana s turn to hold a lead he blanked the yankees in the third , despite a sheffield single , then watched his teammates torture mussina in the bottom of the inning mussina faced six angels , and all of them put the ball in play this is how the angels drive teams crazy only one team in baseball had fewer strikeouts , and while the angels do not always pile up runs , they prove that anything can happen when bat meets ball i was making the pitches i wanted to make , but they were fighting them off and putting them in play , mussina said and when you do that , sometimes things happen orlando cabrera led off with a clean single to left , and he was running as vladimir guerrero blooped a single into noman s land in right center mussina did not allow another wellhit ball , but he also could not get a strikeout the angels created enough chaos to drive him from the game within four batters anderson flied out to shallow center , and cabrera scored from third on the sacrifice the score was 42 , angels , and bengie molina dumped another blooper into shallow right , putting runners at the corners again erstad batted next , with three strikeouts in the series against mussina , this time , he chopped a ball toward first base , and there was nothing jason giambi could do guerrero slid into home with the angels' fifth run , well ahead of giambi s throw , and after a foul out , randy johnson came in for mussina johnson , who had been hit hard in game 3 , threw four and a third shutout innings but santana was nearly as good , shutting out the yankees from the third through the sixth the yankees had a chance to score in the fifth , when cano struck out with two out and two on , but scampered to first on an apparent wild pitch molina s throw skipped away from erstad , but west called cano out for interference torre argued , to no avail the yankees did not have an extrabase hit until the seventh , when jeter homered , but the angels soon put their bullpen relay team into action santana gave way to kelvim escobar , who took the ball to francisco rodriguez for the save jeter s single in the ninth could not spark a scoring rally , and when it was over , he had an empty feeling there s no sense of accomplishment , jeter said we did n't accomplish anything as jeter spoke , there was one item sitting oddly in his empty locker a photograph from an awards show , with roger clemens , jeter and others accepting a trophy after a world serieswinning season rodriguez was not in it neither were sheffield , matsui , mussina or johnson it is a much different team now , an awkward era in yankees history another season is over , and all of the millions for all of the mercenaries could not wake the dynasty from the dead
to the editor re four days on the uncle sam diet , by william grimes \( week in review , jan 23 \) anyone who takes the important step to adopt healthier eating habits deserves praise but i was dismayed by mr grimes s conclusion that because the diet was so unlike that on which he and most americans were raised , its goals , while worthy , were also futile futile is much too strong and discouraging a word i have seen many patients , friends and family members who have altered their eating habits for the better , and i have seen the lifeimproving and lifeextending changes , including reduced incidence or severity of obesity , heart disease , high blood pressure and diabetes few of these people were raised with healthy eating habits none live in a country that makes it easy to eat healthily but all have found a way to enjoy food in a way that does n't threaten their health the new dietary guidelines may seem radical , but if adopted gradually , healthy eating can become second nature and even pleasurable joshua kolko , md rockville , md , jan 24 , 2005 drawing \( drawing by chip wass \)
a small but telling test of iraq s fledgling army came recently in this troubled farm town south of baghdad , when a group of iraqi soldiers , ending a house raid and rushing to board pickups they use as troop carriers , abandoned the blindfolded , handcuffed man they had come to arrest they left the detainee , an astonished american soldier said , spotting the man squatting in the dust along a residential street they just left him there sweet the iraqi troops were on their seventh house raid of the morning , part of a cordonandsearch operation in an area of towns and farmland so dangerous that american soldiers call it the triangle of death prompted by the soldier , the iraqis ran back for the detainee , and managed much of the rest of their mission effectively , rounding up 13 insurgent suspects in three hours without having to call for direct involvement of the watching american troops such limited successes stand against a backdrop of american disappointment with many of the iraqi units , whose effectiveness is crucial to a future american troop withdrawal despite the bush administration s insistent optimism , americans working with the iraqis in the field believe that it could be several years , at least , before the new iraqi forces will be ready to stand alone against the insurgents a few days before the mahmudiya raids , iraqi soldiers at a local checkpoint apparently fell asleep in the hours before dawn , and the checkpoint was ambushed by insurgents they tossed a grenade into the building , then stormed in and executed those left alive , killing at least eight iraqis , american soldiers said since the attack , american troops have been conducting nighttime patrols to make sure the iraqis stay awake the american command has already created military transition teams of soldiers to work with iraqi troops , and there are plans for up to 10 , 000 americans to be attached to iraqi units at every level from divisions down to battalions and companies , with up to 10 men at the battalion level , and 2 with each company i just wish they 'd start to pull their own weight without us having to come out and babysit them all the time , said sgt joshua lower , a scout in the third brigade of the first armored division who has worked with the iraqis some iraqi special forces really know what they are doing , but there are some units that scatter like cockroaches with the lights on when there s an attack the iraqi troops' story is one of light and dark , american officers say especially in regions sympathetic to the insurgents , they have performed woefully , with sunni arab soldiers making little secret of their support for saddam hussein and their contempt for the americans among shiite and kurdish soldiers , the overwhelming majority in the new army , the americans say , there are problems beyond loyalty those inherent in building a new army , at breakneck speed , in the midst of a brutal war we are realists , said lt col frederick p wellman , a former black hawk helicopter pilot and west point graduate who is a spokesman for lt gen david h petraeus , the american who heads the coalition training command in baghdad are the iraqis doing everything perfectly \? no , they are not but they 're in the fight , and they 're taking more casualties than we are increasingly , it is the iraqis who are bearing the burden of this war , even more than americans the mahmudiya raids were one measure of where things stand after taking office on may 3 , iraq s shiite majority government , finding its way after centuries of sunni arab rule in baghdad , was confronted by a new insurgent offensive it ordered a crackdown across the baghdad region , deploying thousands of iraqi troops prime minister ibrahim aljaafari called it the largest iraqiled military operation yet , making it a highly visible test of the american exit strategy but the baghdad sweeps have underscored the raft of problems the american command has identified in the iraqi force buildup , including hasty recruiting , insufficient training and a weak command structure , leading to breakdowns in discipline , especially in combat earlier this year , the pentagon suggested that an initial drawdown of the 140 , 000 american troops in iraq might begin by the end of this year now , american generals are saying it could be two years , perhaps longer few battalions are operational at three main training centers established at former husseinera bases taji , north of baghdad kirkush , near the iranian border and numaniya , southeast of baghdad a 57 billion americanfinanced program to train and equip the new forces is in high gear , graduating soldiers in battalionsize classes of 1 , 500 troops from a single americantrained iraqi battalion a year ago , the american command says there are now 107 battalions of iraqi troops and paramilitary police units , totaling 169 , 000 men the total is set to rise to 270 , 000 by next summer , when 10 fully equipped 14 , 000man iraqi army divisions are scheduled to be operational but figures alone tell only part of the story , since only three battalions are rated fully operational by the americans , and many others are far behind in terms of manpower , training and equipment
san antonio , june 12 manu gin bili began the game with a 3pointer , shot like a flare into the texas sky , and the spurs never trailed again as they started streaking toward victory , and perhaps a place in nba history , the spurs left the pistons unraveling on the court , melting along with their championship memories exasperated , outworked and outclassed , these pistons did not resemble the champions of last season as much as they did their dysfunctional opponent from 2004 , the lakers nearing the end of an uphill game , pistons coach larry brown finally lost his cool after yelling about foul calls so did chauncey billups , the pistons' point guard , and each was whistled for a technical foul with 3 minutes 54 seconds to play and the spurs holding an 18point lead it was as if the pistons , bewildered and befuddled , threw up their hands soon enough , the spurs raised theirs with a thoroughly dominating 9776 victory in game 2 of the nba finals it put them two victories from winning their third championship in seven years if we were in their situation right now , gin bili said , we would be very upset the next three games will be at the palace of auburn hills , and the pistons will have to win at least two detroit won three straight there last year to beat the lakers in five games , but only 2 of 26 teams have rebounded from a 20 series deficit to win a title brown , who declined to talk about the team s technicals , was unsure if a change of site would make a difference i hope so , he said but right now , the way they 're playing and the way they 're executing , the contribution they 're getting from a lot of people , they just dominated two ball games with tim duncan in the middle , and gin bili everywhere on the court , the spurs made the little plays on both ends against a pistons team that suddenly seemed to remember it was in the nba finals too late the spurs led by as many as 23 points in the third quarter when the pistons rallied to within 8 points , gin bili and company made the difference with six minutes to play , gin bili stole the ball and saved it into duncan s hands while falling out of bounds on the sideline bruce bowen then hit his fourth 3pointer of the night , essentially closing the door on detroit i understand that i'm the anchor of the d , bowen said but they feed off of me it s contagious bowen hit 4 of the spurs' 11 3pointers on a night when the team had 24 attempts from beyond the arc the spurs were exceptionally efficient , scoring on 29 field goals and 28 of 34 free throws gin bili finished as the high scorer for the second straight game , with 27 points , and had 7 assists we were just moving the ball so well early , said duncan , who had 18 points and 11 rebounds when we 're playing on that level and hitting shots like that , we 're really tough to beat the pistons , the secondbest defensive team in the league this season , behind the spurs , had no answer to stop the spurs' insideoutside versatility last year in the finals , the lakers never scored more than 45 points in a half against the pistons on sunday , the spurs scored 58 by halftime we got back in the game with effort , brown said but every time we did , they had an answer hopefully with our crowd , we can get out in the beginning , throw the first punch and be aggressive i think we have gotten frustrated and went on our own a little bit too much i think defensively we 've been real soft the pistons left texas demoralized , not knowing if they would return for game 6 the pistons shot only six 3pointers and made none they took just 16 free throws and made 10 i thought we got a little frustrated , billups said every time we made a run , every time we showed we were trying to get back into the game , they made a huge play whether it was a steal or a 3 , they did it when you get into a groove like that , it seems like you get all those kinds of little breaks with gin bili perfect from everywhere on the floor in the first quarter and adding 5 assists , with duncan nearly perfect from the paint , and with parker dashing through the lane , the usually solid help defense of the pistons did not know where to turn the pistons could not find an offensive rhythm , hampered again by tayshaun prince s foul trouble , as the spurs forced them into shooting 364 percent in the first quarter detroit attempted just one 3pointer in the first half and while the guards were able to get the ball inside to rasheed wallace something they did not do in game 1 it was at the expense of the backcourt richard hamilton finished 5 of 15 from the field , unable to deal with the defensive pressure from bowen , but he also missed open shots for the second straight game he finished with 14 points antonio mcdyess , off the bench , led the team with 15 robert horry gave the spurs an immediate lift in the first half known as a clutch shooter , he had three steals in the backcourt in the first half alone , the last steal off a pistons inbounds pass with 167 seconds remaining in the half he dove on the floor , wresting the ball from billups horry called timeout , gin bili got the ball and drove the lane , drawing the foul he knocked down free throws to give the spurs a 5842 lead going into the locker room we had a great game but i do n't think it has been easy , gin bili said game 3 is going to be so tough , with their crowd they will play tough defensively we just got to be patient
for the nation s oil refiners , hurricane katrina was a disaster long in the making analysts and industry executives had for years feared the consequences of a storm ramming into the country s largest energy hub a complex infrastructure that spans most of the coastline between texas and alabama , where nearly half of the nation s refineries are located hurricane katrina confirmed the worst predictions wreaking havoc along the coastal states , drowning new orleans and leaving many dead , the storm shut down nearly all the gulf s offshore oil and gas production for over a week racing to restore operations , the industry has brought about 60 percent of that back the hurricane also knocked off a dozen refineries at the peak of summer demand , sending oil prices higher and gasoline prices to inflationadjusted records the events of the last two weeks have demonstrated how close to the edge the country s refining system had been operating , even before the storm because the last american refinery was built nearly 30 years ago with only a single new one now in the works the problem is unlikely to disappear quickly as a consequence , even though crude oil prices have fallen back to prekatrina levels , prices for gasoline , heating oil , diesel and jet fuel are expected to remain higher than they were before the storm for a much longer period of time there is now a greater realization that we do n't have much extra capacity , said edward h murphy , a refining specialist at the american petroleum institute , a trade and lobbying group it does n't take a katrina , but even a smaller event can create a dislocation in the market disasters like this can give you a billboard on the need to address this we need more capacity the rapid runup in oil prices over the last two years has translated into a boon for refiners after many years of meager returns this year , the refining margin the difference between the cost of buying crude oil and selling refined end products has exceeded 20 a barrel , far above the longterm average of 6 that has meant record profits for oil companies and refiners and aboveaverage stock performance on wall street with profits soaring , the nation s refiners are now being blamed by many drivers and politicians for contributing to the runup in prices indeed , to critics of the industry , the higher profits are evidence of a policy to intentionally limit refining capacity to improve the bottom line oil companies have jacked up gasoline prices through a simple mechanism reducing inventories and refining capacity , said jamie court , president of the foundation for taxpayer and consumer rights , an advocacy group , whose views are widely shared by industry opponents they are supposed to compete and bring the lowest price to consumers , mr court said but the truth is that a small number of oil companies cheat by working together by artificially reducing supplies but that argument misses the point , said bob slaughter , the president of the national petrochemical and refiners association what s happened can be explained by the higher cost of crude oil , the difficulties in building new refineries and the disaster that cut right through the heart of the industry , mr slaughter said currently , four major refineries , owned by chevron , exxon mobil , conocophillips and murphy oil , are either flooded or without power , and are likely to be out of commission for several weeks , perhaps months together , these refine 880 , 000 barrels a day , or 5 percent of domestic capacity it s very significant , said colm mcdermott , an oil analyst at john s herold inc the loss is equal to 1 percent of the world s refining capacity it s a global market and that s certainly enough to have an impact on a global level as many as 15 other refineries , also affected by the storm , are resuming production , but some are still operating at limited capacity there s going to be a lot of pressure on these people to get things up and running and deal with the maintenance issues as they come up , said james w jones , a vice president at turner , mason company , a refining consultancy in dallas many parts of the industry are recovering rapidly the most damage offshore was sustained by royal dutch shell , which said friday that its production , usually about 450 , 000 barrels a day , would be down by 40 percent through the end of the year but even as oil and gas production returns in the gulf , the time that it will take refineries to get back to full speed will be a key factor in determining how long product prices will remain elevated under normal conditions , because of the close proximity of volatile materials , high pressure and fire , restarting a refinery is a dangerous process that can take anywhere between three to seven days in the refinery , oil is heated to around 1 , 110 degrees fahrenheit , turned into vapor and then collected at various temperatures , creating products that are further refined to remove impurities , allowing for the production of gasoline , heating oil , diesel fuel and kerosene for the four damaged refineries three are in the vicinity of new orleans , and the fourth is in pascagoula , miss restarting will involve a much longer process first , power must be restored once that happens , generators , pumps and other electrical equipment flooded by brackish water will need to be dried out removing salt sediments will add to the ordeal then the operators must check that none of their main systems have suffered any structural damage before firing them back up so far , none of the refineries have provided an estimate of how long all that will take in its latest report , chevron , whose 325 , 000 barrelsaday refinery is the largest of the four , said it will be days before a full estimate of damage is known or when operations can be safely brought back online most americans now pay more than 3 a gallon for gasoline matching inflationadjusted highs reached after the iranian revolution in the late 1970 s and early 1980 s and the equivalent , on a perbarrel basis , to 126 oil prices , which touched a high of 7085 a barrel last week , now trade around 64 a barrel , still about 20 short of the record set in 1981 if we lose three or four refiners for two or three months , that shortfall is going to be very difficult to make up , said william e greehey , the chief executive of valero , the nation s largest independent refiner i do n't know how anyone can blame it on us when we 've just had the worst natural disaster in the united states' history the refining outages prompted an international response from industrialized nations to send emergency stocks of oil and gasoline to the united states to plug the shortfall but that is only a temporary solution to a crisis that has been waiting to erupt for years since the 1980 s , the number of refiners in the united states has been cut in half from a peak of 324 in 1981 , the industry has shrunk to 149 as the smaller , less efficient and less profitable operators once protected by price controls closed , leaving mostly larger companies in place refining capacity has fallen about 10 percent , to 17 million barrels a day , while oil consumption rose by 33 percent over the same 24year period , to 208 million barrels a day meanwhile , refiners have been increasing their skill in turning crude into useful products efficiency improved by 27 percent between 1981 and 2004 still , the difference must be made up by direct imports of refined products , with gasoline imports now at 1 million barrels a day as their numbers dwindled , most remaining refiners expanded their plants and added equipment to process more oil many refiners now typically run at 95 percent of capacity , a level that is dangerously high and that has led to a growing number of accidents in recent years in march , for example , a blast at bp s texas city refinery , the country s thirdlargest , killed 15 and injured 170 people the company was blamed by investigators with the chemical safety and hazard investigation board for systemic lapses following the agency s recommendation , bp appointed an independent panel last month to review the safety culture of its american refining operations only one project to build a new refinery is currently under way for the last six years , glenn mcginnis said he has been struggling to line up the permits , funding and oil supplies to build a refinery from scratch in a remote patch in southwest arizona the fundamental reason why there has not been a new refinery built for years is really two reasons economics and uncertainty , mr mcginnis said traditionally , the profit margin for refineries has averaged about 6 percent , a rate of return too low to encourage much new investment added to that is the lengthy process involved in securing the permits from state and federal agencies if you take permits , and engineering , and building , mr mcginnis said , you 're talking about a 10year horizon from the time you decide to build to the day the refinery is completed another issue that has slowed expansion , refiners said , was the cost of complying with environmental regulations set in the 1990 s under the clean air act the american petroleum institute estimates that refiners have spent 47 billion over the last decade to meet carbonemission standards and lowsulfur regulations , with more investments needed through 2007 that , refiners say , is money not spent to raise capacity it has been cheaper to add refining capacity through acquisitions rather than new projects valero recently bought premcor for 10 , 000 a barrel of capacity , a price many analysts deemed high but that is well below the 16 , 000 a barrel that arizona clean fuels , mr mcginnis' project , expects to invest elsewhere in the world , some oil producers are planning to build new refineries saudi arabia is one of them we cannot keep producing oil with no refineries , ali alnaimi , the saudi oil minister , told the industry newsletter petroleum argus a few months ago there is a limit while helpful , such moves abroad would mostly serve to shift the country s increasing reliance on foreign oil producers to a greater dependence on refiners abroad we are going to be importing more products , mr murphy of the american petroleum institute said that is a certainty if we do n't expand our capacity but the problem there is that you 've changed one form of dependency for another storm and crisis energy correction september 23 , 2005 , friday an article on sept 11 about the consequences of a hurricane on the energy industry along the coast from texas to alabama referred incorrectly to the status of a safety panel to review refining operations at bp after an explosion at its texas city plant while bp announced its plan for a panel , no committee has yet been appointed
out of eden an odyssey of ecological invasion by alan burdick illustrated 324 pp farrar , straus giroux 25 for the past few years , i have been engaged in handtohand combat with a 10foottall alien growing thick as toothpicks in a box , just outside my door late in summer , i thrash through the marsh to coat the blades of the phragmites reed with herbicide \( some environmentalists endorse this others abhor it \) in midwinter , i attach a rope to each end of a board and use it to trample down the dead stalks \( politically correct , but bruegelesque , or possibly chaplinesque \) sometimes , when i lurch out of the grass , sweating , muddy and in a spirit of high ecological dudgeon , my dog , maggie , backs away growling \( who is this and what is he doing in my territory \? \) phragmites , a handsome european reed with a feathery crimson plume , got dumped on the coast of new england in heaps of 19thcentury ship ballast it has choked almost every wetland east of the mississippi but in my little pocket of coastal marsh , i have opened up the landscape again and made room for the native grasses and cattails i remember from childhood i have also made room for nesting mute swans , another invader \( should i coddle the eggs and stop them from reproducing \? please do not advise \) i am also acutely aware that if i lay off for a season or two , the phragmites will come booming back the natural world has gone wildly astray , through the kindness of human beings , and there is n't any good way to put it right again should we even bother trying \? it turns out there are lots of people who are obsessed , dismayed and perhaps also occasionally made demented by invasive species often , they fight noble battles they know they are doomed to lose in out of eden , the science writer alan burdick travels the world to chronicle their intriguing , undervalued lives , and those of the species that trouble them the greatest threat to biological diversity is no longer just bulldozers or pesticides but , in a sense , nature itself , burdick writes since its accidental introduction to guam , the australian brown tree snake has extirpated nine native bird species , sending three to extinction one of the last remaining pairs of another species hangs on only because the nest is now barricaded behind electric wires , with branches pruned back to keep snakes from creeping in from nearby trees the couple looked trapped in its safety , like those people in manhattan who secure their apartments with eight locks on the front door alas , the couple also suffered from sexual disharmony , and small wonder one night , researchers with traps caught seven snakes at the door because of its knack for hitchhiking in freight containers and aircraft landing gear , the brown tree snake may yet set up shop in hawaii or san diego or even south florida thousands of other invasive species , many of them of more benign or even beautiful varieties , already surround us they herald an era of creeping sameness , called by one scientist the homogecene tourists freshly escaped from the howling depths of winter may delight in the birdsong and the tropical vegetation in honolulu but everything around them , another scientist tells burdick , is introduced not a single plant , none of the lowland birds in hawaii are native we are turning the world into a mcdonald s ecosystem , with the same species living roughly the same way everywhere burdick is best describing the minute details of this change how does the onslaught of new species affect hawaii s native forests \? the answer comes partly from studying fruit fly species and obscure soil dwellers like springtails and mites that also date back as far as the forests we meet hawaiian drosophilists who ritually stopper specimen vials with torn aloha shirts , to distinguish themselves from mainlanders who still use telltale cotton balls we encounter a parasitologist who would be more comfortable doing pretty much anything other than talking if he were a bird , he might be a night heron liable to stand there blinking in the illumination of a flashlight , then dart away we go underground with a burly entomologist , frank howarth , who listens to the distinctive love songs sent out by different native species of the tiny insects called plant hoppers , which dwell in caves and lava tubes \( howarth once discovered a new species on the property of loretta lynn and named it oliarus lorettae , after her \) the plant hoppers tap out their songs along the rootlets of a native tree burdick likens them to human lovers making a crosstown phone call unfortunately , that tree is being supplanted by an invasive tree species with different roots , resulting in something like a subterranean silent spring the singers are growing mute , burdick writes , each one marooned on the island of itself , unable to communicate , to mate , to sustain its end of evolutionary conversation a kind of unnatural selection at the hands of introduced species is apparently commonplace , with the luckier native species managing to survive through accelerated evolution in 1968 , before introduced mosquitoes caused a malaria pandemic , some native birds in hawaii used to sleep any which way , leaving themselves exposed to mosquito bites by 1986 , those birds had been weeded out , leaving only birds that slept with their legs tucked under their bodies , their bills and faces buried in the fluffed feathers on their backs in australia , toxic cane toads introduced from the americas have favored the proliferation of snakes with mouths too small to swallow them burdick tries to make the case that nature is adaptable enough to handle the changes in our topsyturvy world when scientists figure out how to isolate the problem and interpret all the variables , it appears , for instance , that even having 500pound feral pigs rooting through the forests of hawaii may not do the permanent damage conservationists fear instead of causing local extinctions , he writes , most successful invaders simply blend into the ecological woodwork to the local eye , biological diversity seems to have increased is n't that a good thing \? maybe burdick is simply trying to avoid the hazards of environmental alarmism , but surely this goes too far it does n't square with the evidence he has diligently accumulated what about the australian tree spreading rapidly through the everglades that draws in so much water through its roots that it essentially converts open marsh habitats into dry land \? what about the european green crab , which singleleggedly crushed the softshell clam industry north of cape cod \? and how about , shortly after a cholera epidemic in south america in 1991 , ships dumping ballast water that released the same strain of cholera bacteria into oyster beds at mobile bay in alabama \? the argument that many , or even most , invasive species cause no harm risks encouraging a what , me worry \? attitude in a public already too complacent about environmental change henry david thoreau once defined weeding as the business of making invidious distinctions with the hoe but in the science of invasion biology , the distinctions about what to keep in and what to weed out sometimes really matter burdick s account of the researchers who struggle with this largely thankless work is graceful and inviting he would have written a better book , though , if he had made a more cogent case for why , every now and then , we need to cough up the money to buy those workers a better hoehandrew solomon s noonday demon received a national book award in 2002 he is currently writing a book about families grappling with traumatic difference richard conniff s books include spineless wonders strange tales from the invertebrate world and the ape in the corner office understanding the workplace beast in all of us , to be published this fall
luoyang , china judge li huijuan happened to be in the courthouse file room when clerks , acting on urgent orders , began searching for a ruling on a mundane case about seed prices i handled that case , judge li told the clerks , surprised that anyone would be interested but within days , the luoyang middle court s discipline committee contacted her provincial officials had angrily complained that the ruling contained a serious political error faced with a conflict between national and provincial law , judge li had declared the provincial law invalid in doing so , she unwittingly made legal history , setting in motion a national debate about judicial independence in china s closed political system in many countries , including the united states , a judge tossing out a lowerlevel law would scarcely merit attention but in china , the government , not a court , is the final arbiter of law what judge li had considered judicial common sense , provincial legislators considered a judicial revolt their initial response was to try to crush it judge li , who had on the bench less than three years , feared her career might be finished an order by those in power has forced local leaders , none of whom dared to stand on principle , to sacrifice me , she wrote in rebuttal i'm just an ordinary person , a female judge who tried to protect the law who is going to protect my rights \? faced with the complex demands of governing a chaotic , modernizing country , china s leaders have embraced the rule of law as the most efficient means of regulating society but a central requirement in fulfilling that promise lies unresolved whether the governing communist party intends to allow an independent judiciary the 2003 ruling by judge li has become , quite unexpectedly , a landmark case for the evolving chinese legal system her plight exposed the limits on judicial autonomy in china and the political retribution faced by judges but it also revealed the rising influence of legal reformers scholars and lawyers rallied to judge li s defense and embraced her ruling as a test case , if an accidental one , for a more autonomous court system for the first time , a judge announced a local law or regulation was void , said xiao taifu , a member of the beijing lawyers association , which petitioned the central government on judge li s behalf it was historic for the legal process in china , it was a first , and it carried deep meaning today , china s court system is far from an independent entity that can curb government power often , the courts remain a pliable tool to reinforce that power many judges are poorly educated in the law and corrupt judges often must answer to government officials as much as to the law political pressure is common , and private trial committees often dictate rulings there are also signs of change one of the busiest courts in beijing announced in november that it would stop punishing judges if a ruling was later deemed politically or legally wrong a budding idealism about the law , and its potential to transform chinese society , is evident not only in the number of new lawyers but also in the emerging civic belief that ordinary people have legal rights the case of judge li illustrates how such changes continue to meet enormous resistance within the system judge li , now 32 , a communist party member , is among the new generation of younger judges expected to become the future backbone of a strengthened court system that judge li and others granted interviews for this article reflects , to some extent , the evolution of china s legal system and an effort by the judiciary to be more assertive but the dispute over the seed case taught her that being a judge involved far more than simply interpreting laws when i look back on the cases i dealt with , i have no regrets , she said i do n't think any of the parties involved can complain but , she added , any judge who acts on conscience does so at a risk i think my colleagues and supervisors think i'm na ve , she said and they think i'm not wise youthful ideals meet reality as a teenager , li huijuan first saw a judge as a character in a television soap opera she grew up in southern henan province in the city of nanyang , where she watched dramas about judges in ancient china their passion for justice was scripted , but it inspired a young girl i saw these images of judges and lawyers defending the people , she said i thought it was glorious she was one of three children , and her father was a government official who oversaw local markets to ensure that merchants and vendors abided by city rules and regulations to curry favor with her father , vendors often visited the family s apartment at night , banging on the door with offers of gifts or bribes my father never accepted , judge li recalled he lectured them and drove them out i think i have the same stubbornness in my character my parents taught me to be a straightforward , honest person her two siblings became teachers , an honored profession in china , but li huijuan graduated from henan university with a fouryear degree in law she later earned a master s degree in law at the prestigious university of politics and law in beijing her qualifications placed her in an elite circle at a time when china was starting to introduce new , tougher standards for the legal profession even so , she said much of her education had been more like legal theory the teacher was telling us how it should be , she recalled of her undergraduate studies but they did not teach us how it really worked in china she began learning that lesson in 1996 after she started working at the middle court in luoyang in henan s north she arrived at a courthouse dominated by older judges , some with limited legal education , including retired soldiers given judgeships to reward them for serving their country her na ve belief that judges ruled independently as they did on television was quickly dispelled instead , she learned that cases were heard by panels of judges , whose rulings were often reviewed by supervisors or , in major cases , by private trial committees of court officials judges were held responsible for rulings that carried their name , even if others in the court actually made the decision but if government officials or influential citizens complained about a ruling , a judge could be punished , fined or even fired some judges tried to reduce the pressure of a potential mistake by taking on fewer cases the less you do , judge li said , the fewer mistakes you make she began as a court secretary but quickly qualified as a judge and , later , as a presiding judge in january 2003 , she was named presiding judge over a threejudge panel hearing a dispute between two local companies over the price of seeds the legal dispute revolved around a conflict between provincial and national law , but judge li never anticipated that that would bring her trouble instead , the political subtext of the case the parochial interests of two local companies fighting over thousands of dollars infused the process at one point , a city official forwarded a letter from one company to judge li s supervisor in the margin , the official had written an instruction for the court please pay attention i felt quite uncomfortable when i received the letter , she said i felt they were making assumptions that i was already taking sides i did n't do anything about it i just put it in the files at another point , the director of the luoyang court since replaced on an unrelated matter telephoned judge li a representative from one of the companies was in his office could she meet with him \? i considered this very inappropriate , judge li said but i could n't say so because of the director so i told the man to come to my office when he arrived , judge li said , she pretended to be stuck on a long telephone call exasperated , the man finally left a system grappling with reform legal experts say political pressure on judges is routine and derives , in part , from the subservient status of the court system within the chinese bureaucracy nationally , the chief judge of the people s supreme court is not even a member of the politburo , the inner decisionmaking entity of the communist party by comparison , the head of the ministry of public security is a member locally , judges are appointed by their people s congresses , while the courts receive their budget from local governments in addition , branches of the communist party operate committees that can apply pressure and exert influence on a court behind the scenes earlier this year , a presiding judge in the northeastern city of harbin told workers' daily , a statecontrolled newspaper , that government officials had overruled three different innocent verdicts and ordered the courts to convict a local businessman of fraud the presiding judge was later censured for publicizing the case the system also can make it easy for corrupt court officials to exploit their position in april 2004 , two vice directors of the middle court in wuhan , a large city in central china , were sentenced to prison for selling verdicts in exchange for 500 , 000 in bribes the directors paid judges to participate in the scheme many legal reformers believe the court system must become more autonomous to eliminate corruption in the legal system but in seeking more authority , they also are trying to rapidly modernize the system and improve judicial training to counter public perceptions that too many judges are corrupt or unqualified the public may be skeptical about judicial independence , given the quality of judges and judgments , said he weifang , a prominent constitutional scholar but if you want accountability , you can only have accountability if you have independence otherwise , it is never clear who made a decision on the campus of the national judges college on the outskirts of beijing , the primary educational arm of the people s supreme court , roughly 10 , 000 judges spend a month of every year on professional training in the past , judges were taught to serve the interests of the communist party , but now a different message is emphasized we train them with a modern theory of law that the courts are impartial , on the need for legal justice and of innocence until proven guilty , said huai xiaofeng , president of the college we stress that during a trial , you cannot favor the government or the national people s congress in the past , they told them to emphasize the political qualities now , we tell them to emphasize the law and the facts for judge li , the reaction to the ruling on the seed case proved how political considerations remained deeply embedded in the legal system because the case seemed likely to provoke controversy , she had submitted a draft ruling to the court director , who in turn forwarded it to a trial committee everyone signed off , and both parties were informed in june 2003 but by october , word of the case had reached the henan province people s congress , the provincial legislature in the legal affairs office , the ruling was interpreted as a naked challenge to the lawmaking authority of the people s congress provincial officials publicly described the ruling as a serious breach of law the authority of the national people s congress system is not to be challenged , said mao yinduan , head of the legal office , in an interview the judge in this case was very young and had little experience she had every right to choose which law to use but courts have no right in a verdict to say which law is invalid the reaction stunned judge li to research the verdict , she had studied chinese law , as well as the speeches of senior political leaders china s law on legislation stated that local laws that conflicted with national laws should be abolished she thought including this point in her opinion was within her judicial purview she had not intended to challenge the political system , nor , apparently , did her director or anyone on the trial committee he read the verdict and did n't realize the significance of what it said , judge li said of the director i , at first , did n't realize the significance , either but judge li , not the court officials who had approved the decision , faced the possibility of serious punishment i felt persecuted , she recalled everyone i talked to told me what i had done was wrong job saved but system unchanged anxious and uncertain of her future , li huijuan telephoned her husband , chang jianyi high school sweethearts , they married in 1999 but lived apart because mr chang worked in beijing as a software developer his wife reached him on a business trip to tibet , and he advised her to seek help in beijing he believed she had been wronged she had to fight back to restore her reputation and her dignity , mr chang said if she did not fight back , she would have to live with the stain she left for beijing and planned to seek help from an association of women in the judiciary she wrote a long passionate letter in which she promised to undergo criticism and education if she had erred but if i'm right , i will protect my integrity and defend the integrity of the law , even if it means being like a moth that flies into a flame at the association s office , a woman told her that she had been treated too harshly and agreed to contact someone at the people s supreme court then the case attracted the attention of the chinese news media and of scholars and lawyers pushing for legal reform mr he , the constitutional scholar , rose to her defense in an oped article in an interview , he characterized the seed case as one of the most important in the legal evolution of china because of the attention it focused on judicial independence it may not be marbury v madison , mr he said of the landmark case credited with establishing the authority of the united states supreme court , but it is a very important case as it turned out , judge li had stumbled upon a fundamental contradiction in the chinese system , based loosely on european models and the old soviet structure , judges are supposed to refer conflicts in law for review by the standing committee of the national people s congress , the country s center of legislative power judges are then expected to follow the decision made by the standing committee yet , in practical terms , those referrals rarely happen and when they do , the standing committee has rarely showed interest in the housekeeping role as a result , judges have become accustomed to assuming this role , if doing so silently , and then simply leaving the conflicting law untouched to many lawyers , the system was grossly inefficient and outdated mr xiao , the beijing lawyer , joined three other lawyers in formally requesting that the national people s congress review the situation scholars organized a legal conference at the elite tsinghua university to debate the seed case and other issues about judicial autonomy the public attention , and the possible intervention on her behalf by the people s supreme court , apparently saved judge li s career she returned to work in summer 2004 before leaving on maternity leave later that year she is now in beijing on a leave to continue her legal studies but the system remained largely intact in summer 2004 , the standing committee announced the creation of a new review panel to mediate conflicts of law some lawyers have hailed the panel as the equivalent of a constitutional court others are concerned about the panel s secrecy and believe the responsibility should belong to the courts judge li still believes in the rule of law , but she is no longer the impressionable teenager who watched soap operas about judges judges are confused , she said it is not that they do not know how to do cases professionally it is just all these relationships to coordinate and they also have to weigh consequences in 2004 , henan s high court reheard the seed case it ruled exactly as judge li had , with one exception it criticized her for invalidating the provincial law articles in this series periodically examine the struggle in china over the creation of a modern legal system additional photographs and previous

the norton anthology of children s literature the traditions in english edited by jack zipes , lissa paul , lynne vallone , peter hunt and gillian avery illustrated 2 , 471 pp w w norton company paper , 65 when i was growing up in the 1960 s and 1970 s , most of the anthologies of children s literature i encountered were called treasuries the word spoke to the editors' intention to cull from the mass of writings for children those that were of value literary , educational or religious the point , it seemed , was to provide a nutritious alternative to the unceasing diet of comic books and other productions of mass culture \( including television \) with which children preferred to stuff themselves of course , being a child , i did n't know then that the study of children s literature was in those years just coming into its own as an academic discipline it has since spread widely , and today the english department at the university where i teach offers a surfeit of courses on children s literature , from psychoanalysis and children s literature to the literature of adolescence to a survey of newbery medal winners it is for this academic audience principally at the college and university level that the new norton anthology of children s literature is intended like most norton anthologies , at first glance it resembles a recycling bin filled to its nearly 2 , 500page brim flip through the very thin pages and your eye will land on everything from dick whittington s cat to little nemo in slumberland to the story of babar the little elephant do n't be daunted by the book s proportions a careful examination reveals the intelligence and care that its editors jack zipes of the university of minnesota , lissa paul of the university of new brunswick , lynne vallone of texas a m university , peter hunt of cardiff university , and gillian avery , a historian of children s literature based in oxford have put into its construction they are selectors , not collectors , and their book , for all its exhaustiveness , is lucid , readerfriendly and most important fun organization is the key here rather than taking a strictly historical approach , the editors have wisely chosen to divide their material into broad categories everything from primers to animal fables to adventure stories and then arrange the material under each heading in chronological order this strategy allows readers to investigate the history of children s literature both by period and by genre , to juxtapose \( for example \) an anonymous 1667 alphabet that begins in adams fall we sinned all with dr seuss' 1963 a b c as the lucid preface notes , the earliest texts intended for children were instructive in nature indeed , it was n't until the 1744 publication of a little pretty pocketbook that the possibility emerged of a children s book in which amusement rather than religious indoctrination was a central concern since then , authors have tried to balance the goals of educating and entertaining young readers , often with mixed results children usually do n't trust what they are told will be good for them nor are they likely to be taken in by the candy wrapped around the pill in my childhood i favored maurice sendak s bizarre , sometimes scatological fantasies over robert louis stevenson s child s garden of verses examples of both , as it happens , are included here , as are samplings from such classic writers as hans christian andersen , rudyard kipling and louisa may alcott yet the selections are not necessarily what we expect , and more crucially , they sit cheek by jowl with works that would have made the editors of the treasuries tremble with alarm indeed , it is in the breadth of their selections that the editors of the norton anthology most clearly distinguish themselves from their predecessors yes , we get books of instruction and school stories , but we also get a trove of noncanonical works comics \( both mickey mouse and dan dare , pilot of the future , are represented \) , playground verse , and an attractive color supplement that begins with an excerpt from heinrich hoffmann s 1845 slovenly peter , the story of a boy who refused to cut his nails and another who had his fingers chopped off , and ends with one from jon scieszka s marvelously subversive stinky cheese man and other fairly stupid tales \( 1992 \) nor are works excluded on the grounds that they might be construed as racist , sexist or politically contentious the editors , in their commentary , address the anticipated criticism head on , noting of the story of little black sambo , for instance , that the book has been widely banned , despite its innocent intentions , possibly mystic interpretations , and indian rather than african characters compared with other anthologies of its kind , the norton anthology is relatively light on academic baggage yes , we get historical introductions to each category and work , a few footnotes , some bibliographies and a timeline yet there are none of the tedious teaching guides or tiresome lists of questions for class discussion the strongest impression one takes away from this anthology is of the degree to which , over the centuries , children s literature has unshackled itself from its early pedagogical restraints and taken off in unforeseen imaginative directions writers as diverse as e nesbit , beverly cleary and roald dahl have in common a remarkable immunity to the tyrannies of socalled seriousness that too often hobble the efforts of their adult counterparts rereading them here , i was able to rekindle some of the undiluted joy i got out of their work when i was a child i also remembered that literature is not , as it is sometimes regarded today , a kind of immense vitamin , good for us if difficult to get down it must also have a wild and vital flavor of giant peaches , green eggs and ham , the gingerbread from which witches construct their houses authors of adult fiction would do well to take a \( thin \) page from this estimable , erudite and enjoyable anthology , which reminds us how much pleasure matters in reading , for grownups as well as for children david leavitt s most recent book is the man who knew too much alan turing and the invention of the computer he is also the coeditor , with mark mitchell , of several anthologies
camden , nj , july 19 anger fatigue disbelief those were the feelings people in camden shared on tuesday after hearing about new autopsy results indicating that the three boys who suffocated in the trunk of a car last month may have been trapped for several hours , possibly even more than a day , before they died this is going to make it more difficult , said the rev floyd l white iii , a presbyterian minister here knowing there could have been an opportunity to save these kids , well , that s a piece of this that is going to be hard to accept additional autopsy results , officially released on tuesday by the camden county prosecutor s office , indicated that the three boys might have been alive for the better part of the search , slowly fading away in the trunk of a brokendown toyota while the police and others scoured rivers , drainpipes and tickinfested woods everywhere , it seems , except where the boys were trapped what upsets many people here is that the boys died just steps away from a house crowded with the police and family members a big question is why no one heard anything camden authorities have declined to say whether there were signs of struggle like dents on the inside of the trunk or cuts or bruises on the children family members who watched the boys in the yard say they took their eyes off them for only a halfhour another issue is why none of the police dogs picked up a scent several trained dogs were dispatched to sniff around the neighborhood where the boys disappeared but apparently none tracked the scent back to the car rich goodwin , a volunteer searcher who joined the effort last month , said on tuesday that the dogs might have had problems because of all the commotion they were using mainly airscent dogs , mr goodwin said , as opposed to groundtracking bloodhounds with all those scents in the air , the dogs could have gotten confused the children were missing for 49 hours , from 5 30 pm on june 22 , when they were last seen playing in a side yard , to 6 30 pm on june 24 , when they were discovered dead in the trunk , which family members and the police had failed to check the new results estimated that the boys died 16 to 36 hours before they were found , which means they were alive in the trunk 13 to 33 hours the police said that the boys climbed into the trunk of the car , parked just feet from where they were last seen , while playing and that it locked behind them but helen cole , a nun who works in camden s crimeridden slums , said the new results were spawning a tangle of conspiracy theories you know what i'm hearing \? she asked that people do n't believe that they were alive that long they think somebody put the kids in there dead people just ca n't understand how else this could have happened meanwhile , the family of one of the three boys , anibal cruz , 11 , has retained a lawyer to explore suits against camden authorities and possibly toyota on monday , the lawyer , peter m villari , said the numbers speak for themselves they were certainly alive when the police arrived and certainly well after the search started the camden county prosecutor s office plans to release a report next week explaining why the children were not found alive
at aburiya kinnosuke , a new restaurant in midtown , you probably wo n't spot any celebrities , the way you might at a more lavish , trendy japanese pleasure palace like megu or nobu you definitely wo n't find elaborately constructed , kaleidoscopic sushi rolls , the kind that look more like kites than supper , or whimsically shaped stemware filled with neoncolored potions , the kind that look more like chemistry experiments than drinks here s what you will see , or at least what i did , every time i went tables filled with japanese businessmen , neckties still on , briefcases nearby , speaking japanese to servers who fared much better in that language than in english in front of them they had banquets of food that was largely unfamiliar , and on their faces they had very broad smiles this restaurant was clearly delighting them , sating them and offering them something much closer to , and more consistent with , what they would get in tokyo than what they would get in tribeca that caught my attention , and my own delight kept me coming back for more plunging into the restaurant s lengthy menu , which was supplemented each night by dozens of specials , i had a sense of seemingly boundless possibility , of new flavors that it would take quite some time to exhaust i had a sense of discovery and i had tuna collar , again and again , because like so much else at aburiya kinnosuke , it s not something that many other new york restaurants serve it looked like a veal chop , big bones and all the meat was tawny and rich , not in the manner of toro but in a muskier , messier vein some bits were darker than others , and some hid in crevices between skin and bone using chopsticks to grab hold of them was like excavating layers of earth , each slightly different it s an activity i recommend , as i do aburiya , with a few caveats the menu is so expansive and arcane that a diner can encounter bad luck as easily as good and wind up with food that disappoints , if only because it s so peculiar one night i blithely ventured in the direction of dried baby squid , only to make a hasty retreat after one repellently fishy , intensely funky bite due in part to the language barrier , service can be awkward the people who waited on my friends and me had trouble explaining what various dishes were and , in some cases , why it was taking so long for these dishes to arrive a few of these servers , seemingly reluctant to intrude on us , succeeded in ignoring us but for a diner in the right frame of mind , the oddities of aburiya just seem like part of the adventure aburiya was opened several months ago by the restaurateurs who operate yakitori totto , a more casual japanese restaurant in midtown aburiya is more expensive although the price of each modestly proportioned dish is often low , it can take four or five of those dishes , at an aggregate cost of 35 to 45 , to fill a diner up in return , the restaurant adds a layer of gloss and a measure of serenity to the kind of nononsense , nocompromises ethnic fidelity more easily found in nofrills haunts it s a pleasant escape that always made me feel as if i were traveling far away from the rest of the city it provides several seating options there are semiprivate nooks fronted by sliding latticed wood doors , a common area with tightly packed tables along a banquette and , in the back , a counter around a robata grill the restaurant s menu is divided into many parts , including housemade tofu , salads , sashimi , and rice and noodle dishes but grilling occupies center stage it can even occupy the center of the table under the heading shichirin grill , which refers to a small portable vessel , the restaurant serves meat and fish that diners can grill over binchotan charcoal , which produces little smoke during my visits hanger steak and red snapper were among the options in both cases , servers placed a big leaf over the grill , and we were instructed to slather that leaf with sweet red miso paste , then put the flesh and a heap of scallions over that when the paste bubbled , we were told , the food would be done but the bubbling was a poor barometer for both the beef , which needed more cooking , and the fish , which needed less in addition , the miso and scallions registered too strongly the fruits of the robata grill , which also uses binchotan charcoal , were more reliable the tuna collar , listed on the menu as neck , came from that , and so did salmon neck , another fatty , slightly gamy , challenging and rewarding cut the robata produced crispskinned chicken wings , succulent strips of pork cheek and tender ribbons of sea eel it was the cradle of what the menu called a chicken meatball , really a chicken meatloaf , eggy , gooey and comforting i had n't tried black sesame tofu before aburiya , but i hope to have it again , especially now that i know what i did n't when i took my first few bites that the tiny mound of salt beside it had a real purpose applied sparingly , it played a pivotal role in blunting the edges of the sesame gomoku kinpira , a saut ed mixture of thinly sliced mushroom , carrot , burdock root , lotus root and more , was like a slaw that had begun evolving into a lo mein , taking on greater weight , more flavor and oiliness cold , circular wedges of japanese sticky yam , with the taste and texture of a slick potato , had been pickled and seasoned with wasabi they were slimy on the outside , softer within , and had a fiery finish on the tongue i could n't stop eating them , and by that time my last visit to aburiya i was no longer staring at the tables of japanese diners or soliciting advice from japansavvy friends to determine what to eat i was just guessing , improvising in a way , that s the most authentic experience of all

the dozen students sitting in a classroom here at westchester community college stared intently at their instructor , a woman in a head scarf , as she spoke to them about the koran in reply to one student , who wondered whether the religious leaders of the seventh century took advantage of the illiterates , dr mahjabeen hassan , a physician who teaches the course , said , the prophet was illiterate she continued he received the message the first is recitation , then it was written down over the course of 23 years people would accompany the book and teach it if you do it on your own , you will get lost , and miss the message that s what is happening you ca n't take just one verse of the koran and criticize , unless you understand the whole philosophy the book is there to control destructive behavior this was not a seminar on middle eastern studies for undergraduates the students , with paperback editions of the koran propped on their desks , were well past the age of conventional college students many , in fact , probably had collegeage grandchildren the students were members of the collegium for lifelong learning , an innovative program begun here in the fall intended for county residents who have retired from businesses , professions , and heavyduty homemaking , but not from the life of the mind , according to the brochure , the first session featured courses like the tragic hero , oedipus to willy loman genetics and you colony to empire benchmarks in us diplomacy the orchestra and complexities and peculiarities of ny state local government this pilot program was planned as two sixweek semesters , with the spring term scheduled to start in march \( for more information , call 7856793 \) for 125 , participants became members of the collegium and could enroll for up to four courses the teachers are volunteers who are not paid for leading the courses the college has offered classes to those age 50 and over for more than 20 years through its mainstream program the collegium is different , intended to take adult education beyond the standard potpourri of more basic classes and howto programs none is a howto course , said edith litt , the chairman of the steering committee for the collegium , which is an affiliate of the elderhostel institute network there s no beginning computing , no knitting , no gardening we may very well offer a course on botany , for example they are all high school or college level , intellectual courses there s a chance to socialize it s adult ed there s no credit , and no exams but they 're expected to do the reading and to participate we make it clear that we 're offering intellectual courses to people who want to talk to other similar people some of the retired faculty are retired teachers who just love to teach in addition to the classes , there is a social component , with scheduled coffee breaks and lunch it looked interesting , with a new group of people , said evelyn stock , who added that her motivation to take part in the program was social as well as intellectual it s a good concept it depends on the people who come purchase college also offers a program geared to retirees through its lifelong learning program , which offers classes on a credit and noncredit basis the college also provides classes at two residential retirement complexes , sterling glen in rye brook and the osborne in rye joseph helmrich , a retired businessman who enrolled in three courses in the collegium , including the one on the koran , said the experience was invaluable i know very little about the koran , he said it s very much in our lives you ca n't escape it and perhaps emblematic of the kind of person attracted to the collegium was laura katz , who recently retired from her job at the new york power authority i love school , she said i have not been back in years , other than a few continuingeducation classes at scarsdale those were not academic they were more practical in 35 years , i 've never been on this campus before i saw something in a newspaper , and thought , 'this is a great idea' i love history i'm pleased photo paul lustig dunkel , music director of the westchester philharmonic , addressing a class of the collegium for lifelong learning last fall \( photo by suzy allman for the new york times \)
washington , sept 5 as a supreme court law clerk to william h rehnquist decades ago , john g roberts jr learned how not to be chief justice now that president bush has chosen him for the position , he will , if the senate confirms him , have the rare chance to put those lessons into practice his boss back in 198081 was an associate justice , one who often chafed under the leadership style of chief justice warren e burger and who freed , even encouraged , his law clerks to poke fun at what they saw as the chief justice s pomposity and penchant for selfaggrandizement robert m weisberg , who clerked during the same term for another justice , said monday that he would never forget walking down a corridor at the court and coming upon justice rehnquist and his law clerks , who were all peering through a window into an inner courtyard , where chief justice burger was supervising preparations for a reception it was very funny to see rehnquist and his clerks just spontaneously cracking up at the sight of the chief justice directing the proper placement of the silver , mr weisberg said later , when mr roberts was working in the white house counsel s office , memorandums from that period show , he devoted considerable attention to knocking down various proposals from chief justice burger , including one for a new tribunal to ease the supreme court s workload in a 1983 memorandum , to fred f fielding , the white house counsel , he said a burger request for authority to name an administrative chancellor for the federal courts was the silliest of various proposals and added , in a reference to the anglophilia for which the chief justice was well known around the court , the bill does not specify whether the chancellor will wear a powdered wig justice rehnquist , upon becoming chief justice in 1986 , promptly made changes that clearly reflected his own disapproval of how warren burger had run the court for example , he converted the job of administrative assistant to the chief justice into a twoyear appointment rather than a permanent position , to avoid the empirebuilding that had become evident during the burger years the very different rehnquist management style , straightforward and unadorned , was much appreciated within the court , as reflected in the statements the associate justices issued after chief justice rehnquist s death on saturday night justice ruth bader ginsburg called him the fairest , most efficient boss i have ever had as a law clerk , judge roberts , who now sits on the federal appeals court here , would not have been in a position to observe the justices' conference , the twiceweekly closeddoor sessions that only the justices themselves attend but he certainly knew how frustrating justice rehnquist found the meandering and confusing way in which the conference proceeded under chief justice burger s leadership among the papers that justice harry a blackmun left to the library of congress is a letter justice rehnquist sent to chief justice burger that began dear chief i had a feeling that at the very close of today s conference we may have fitted matthew arnold s closing lines in 'dover beach' wherein he refers to those swept with confused alarms of struggle and flight where ignorant armies clash by night ' justice rehnquist then went on to take the liberty of stating my understanding of what had taken place when he became chief justice , he streamlined the conference considerably , and justices rarely came away with any doubt about what had occurred running the conference is only one of a chief justice s many functions that are not visible to the public indeed , the job is somewhat like an iceberg , with much of it below the surface and it is confusing there is no one place to look for a definitive description of the job the modern chief justiceship is a mix of custom , practice and statute , according to judith resnik , a professor at yale law school who has made a close study of the federal judiciary and the role of the chief justice in particular in an interview on monday , professor resnik noted that there were dozens of federal statutes that mention the chief justice , with half a dozen that really matter the constitution itself did not even establish the office except by implication , mentioning it only in connection with presiding over impeachment trials conducted by the senate it s basically a role that has developed over the 20th century , as the federal judiciary has developed into a kind of administrative agency , professor resnik said for example , chief justice burger established , and chief justice rehnquist continued , the practice of issuing an annual state of the judiciary report to give voice to the concerns of federal judges and the chief justice s own priorities the chief justice presides over a corps of some 2 , 000 federal judges , including 1 , 200 with life tenure and the rest , including magistrate and bankruptcy judges , who serve for fixed terms the judicial branch includes a staff of 30 , 000 , with the chief justice picking the most important central administrators , and runs on an annual budget of 54 billion the chief justice also picks the members of important policymaking judicial committees and of specialized courts , including the 11member foreign intelligence surveillance act court , which issues special national security surveillance warrants in addition , the chief justice leads the judicial conference of the united states , a group of judges who make policy for the federal courts and who present the judiciary s views to congress the judicial conference has its roots in an organization created by congress in 1922 at the behest of chief justice william howard taft , the former president , who carved out an active policy role for the chief justice he shaped the modern court by lobbying successfully for legislation to give the court discretion in choosing which cases to hear as a student of american history , judge roberts may find none of this a surprise nor is it a surprise that professor resnik and other scholars are beginning to ask whether this array of powers , having grown bit by bit over the years , with hardly anyone noticing , really belongs in the hands of a single , unelected , lifetenured official as a democracy , we generally do n't believe that power should be centralized in one person for so long , she said , while offering the concededly audacious suggestion that the chief justiceship might rotate every four years or so perhaps that is a conversation that might move from the recesses of the legal academy to the public , sometime during the 25 or 30 years that chief justice roberts would be likely to serve
the corporate jet that crashed into a warehouse in teterboro , nj , last month with 11 people on board was carrying too much of its weight in front , federal investigators said in a preliminary report released yesterday the national transportation safety board , which is still investigating the crash , said that the plane s center of gravity was well forward of the allowable limit tests on a flight simulator showed that the plane would not have been able to lift off at its normal takeoff speed with the balance of fuel , passengers and baggage it was carrying , according to the report the balance was off , and there was too much weight near the front , said keith holloway , a spokesman for the safety board in washington he said the investigators had not concluded what caused the crash , but said the finding is definitely an important issue that we 're looking into the plane had accelerated beyond its designated takeoff speed as it raced up a runway at teterboro airport on the frigid morning of feb 2 unable to raise the plane s nose skyward , the pilots aborted the takeoff , slamming on the brakes too late to stop on the tarmac the plane skidded off the end of the runway , crashed through a fence and swerved through morning rush traffic on route 46 , before slamming into two cars and a clothing warehouse none of the eight passengers were hurt , but the pilots were hospitalized and two men who were in a toyota sedan on the highway were severely injured the passengers were financial executives from manhattan who were bound for chicago they had hired a charter company , platinum jet management of fort lauderdale , fla , to take them there in a canadair cl600 challenger a safety board official said last month that the pilot in command of the flight , john kimberling , told investigators that the steering yoke had jammed , preventing him from completing the takeoff yesterday , michael a moulis , a lawyer for platinum jet , disputed the safety board s finding and insisted that the cause was a mechanical failure , not an error by the flight crew the plane s center of gravity may have been shifted forward , he said , but the pilot could have made up for that discrepancy by taking off at higher speed that plane has been flown like that for two years with that center of gravity without incident , mr moulis said mr moulis pointed out that just two weeks ago , the pilot of a cl600 challenger taking off from tupelo , miss , reported a similar problem according to a safety board report , that jet ran off the end of a runway on march 9 , after the pilot found he could not pull back the steering column and aborted the takeoff that plane was bound for teterboro on small jets , the pilot and flight crew are responsible for determining whether the weight and balance are within acceptable limits in december 2003 , another challenger jet ran off a runway at teterboro after its pilot aborted a takeoff a year later , the safety board reported that the airplane was above the maximum gross takeoff weight , and outside the forward centerofgravity envelope the probable cause in that incident , the investigators concluded , was inadequate preflight planning by the pilot
washington , june 2 on monday , in a memorial day ritual , president bush laid a wreath honoring the nation s war dead in arlington national cemetery then liz sweet got her turn accompanied by a military honor guard , she helped lay a wreath honoring soldiers killed in iraq , including her 23yearold son , tj his photograph hung below the wreath on a ribbon mrs sweet had fashioned in red , white and blue , a rare public tribute to a soldier who took his own life although military officials were not asked for approval , mrs sweet and a veterans' advocate wanted to recognize the sacrifice of soldiers who committed suicide for their families , the loss can be especially excruciating not only did your child go off to a combat zone , mrs sweet said not only did your child lose his life but something happened that you will never , ever understand one of the questions that haunts her is whether her son s suicide could have been prevented in a required predeployment health questionnaire in august 2003 , tj it stands for thomas john reported that he had sought mental health treatment during the previous year such an answer should have triggered a referral for further evaluation , army officials say but under referral indicated , an army physician s assistant had marked none , and declared specialist sweet deployable the system failed , said mrs sweet , a 53yearold mental health administrator who works near washington and lives in frederick , md she has written to military officials in search of answers , receiving letters of consolation that leave her unsatisfied according to the pentagon , 40 soldiers in iraq and seven others in afghanistan have killed themselves , and 21 marines have committed suicide either in the region or while on active duty in the united states the numbers do not include suicides that occurred after discharge veterans' advocates have identified more than 30 such cases from news accounts but say the total may be considerably higher some military health experts say they believe the surreptitious threat from suicide bombers and snipers in iraq is even more stressful than open combat through the end of april , 1 , 118 army men and women had been evacuated from iraq for psychiatric reasons , according to official statistics through february , according to the department of veterans affairs , 12 , 020 veterans of iraq and afghanistan had been treated for posttraumatic stress disorder the wording on the wreath that mrs sweet helped set in front of the marble tomb of the unknowns made subtle note of those who died at their own hand at home after discharge in memory of those who served and died in afghanistan , iraq , gulf and home , said the inscription , prepared by mrs sweet and stephen l robinson , the director of the national gulf war resource center , an advocacy group for veterans of recent wars mr robinson , a former ranger who wrote a report on the mental health problems of soldiers in iraq , has become an informal counselor to some families of suicides he invited mrs sweet to present his group s wreath on monday this , too , is part of the cost of war , mr robinson said he said he was not aware of any previous occasion when a soldier who died by suicide was singled out in the memorial day observances at the arlington cemetery the suicide of tj sweet ii came on thanksgiving day in 2003 , just minutes after an angry exchange with a superior as the young army specialist rushed to find parts for a 50caliber machine gun and begin guard duty he was ordered to do five pushups and told he was being taken off the promotion list , his mother said the promotion was especially important because specialist sweet had vowed to outrank his father , tom , a retired teacher who served in vietnam army investigators found that specialist sweet had shot himself with his m16 rifle growing up in bismarck , nd , where his parents lived until recently , specialist sweet had no history of mental illness , his mother said in an interview on her blouse she wore her son s unit crest , with the slogan , faithful and true , and a tiny framed portrait of her son in uniform but there had been hints of trouble , she said after basic training in 1999 , specialist sweet was assigned to fort riley , kan , and had difficulty sleeping he went to a clinic and was given a diagnosis of generalized anxiety disorder but no medication when he was preparing to leave for iraq , he told his parents he was eager to try out his skills but having been trained as an artilleryman , he said he feared he would make a poor infantryman in a letter from iraq shortly before his death , his mother said , specialist sweet asked if his parents could immediately send him some ritalin , a drug he had taken in childhood for attention deficit disorder they were working 18hour shifts and could n't take showers , mrs sweet said her son described sandstorms that resembled the whiteout blizzards of north dakota but she said she had no idea of the degree of his distress , mrs sweet said , until an army officer knocked on the door as her family prepared to sit down for thanksgiving dinner , bringing the worst imaginable news specialist sweet was promoted , to sergeant , after all , his mother said , a decision made by his army superiors after his funeral back home in bismarck
the gossip on the international circuit is that the most prominent tournament of the year is no longer linares , in spain , or dortmund , in germany , but the corus wijk aan zee in the netherlands in response to the criticism that there were too many draws in the corus , it has been pointed out that nearly all of the world s toprated players , including secondranked viswanathan anand of india and vladimir kramnik of russia , the current world champion , were in the corus , and none of them are known for dropping points against their peers actually , there were many hardfought games that came down to draws only because of sterling counterplay by the defenders , counterplay that is generally not known to lesser adversaries the corus this year , which was held from jan 14 to 30 , was won by peter leko of hungary , who in october had played kramnik in a match for the world championship that match ended in a tie , meaning that kramnik retained the title in the corus tournament , leko scored 8 1 24 1 2 to surpass anand by a half point veselin topalov of bulgaria was third with 7 1 25 1 2 , and a halfpoint behind him , judit polgar , alexander grischuk , michael adams and kramnik tied for fourth after this victory , leko has to be regarded as one of the three leading challengers for kramnik s crown , along with anand and garry kasparov , the world s topranked player , who did not play at corus in a ninthround game , leko defeated nigel short of britain although short shines at attacking play , he does n't favor following known gambits he likes to slip into attacks from seemingly harmless situations here , for example , he did not go for a marshall gambit with 7 00 and 8 d5 the point of his redeployment with 9 nb8 and 10 nb7 was that it gave his c pawn the option of moving to c6 or c5 this committed him to the development of his queen bishop to a fianchetto with 11 bb7 but this is what he wanted anyway to bring pressure to bear on the e5 pawn in the closed ruy lopez , as here , the white queen knight is mobilized at f1 , for one thing because the c3 square is occupied by a white pawn and this knight can find good work at e3 for a center attack or a kingside attack at g3 after 15 bg7 , the black center pawns were quite well defended , so there was little use standing there and staring at them thus , leko took a semiblocked queenside by advancing with 16 d5 qe7 17 c4 at this point , short would like to block the entire queenside before leko started a pawnslide with b4 , c5 and so on after 24 bc5 dc , the black queenside pawns were split and therefore weak leko had the advantage he needed to win after 37 d6 ! , short , seeing that 37 rc5 38 d7 would lead to a lost position , gave up
the morning hurricane katrina thundered ashore , louisiana national guard commanders thought they were prepared to save their state but when 15foot floodwaters swept into their headquarters , cut their communications and disabled their highwater trucks , they had their hands full just saving themselves for a crucial 24 hours after landfall on aug 29 , guard officers said , they were preoccupied with protecting their nerve center from the waves topping the windows at jackson barracks and rescuing soldiers who could not swim the next morning , they had to evacuate their entire headquarters force of 375 guardsmen by boat and helicopter to the superdome it was an inauspicious start to the national guard s hurricane response , which fell so short that it has set off a national debate about whether in the future the pentagon should take charge immediately after catastrophes president bush has asked congress to study the question , and top defense department and guard officials are scheduled to testify on the response before a house panel today other elements of the response to hurricane katrina are also coming into question the new orleans police chief , edwin p compass iii , resigned yesterday after the department announced that 250 police officers roughly 15 percent of the force could face discipline for leaving their posts without permission during the storm and its aftermath the former head of the federal emergency management agency , michael d brown , testified in congress that he had warned the white house of impending disaster several days before the storm struck page a25 in interviews , guard commanders and state and local officials in louisiana said the guard performed well under the circumstances but they say it was crippled in the early days by a severe shortage of troops that they blame in part on the deployment to iraq of 3 , 200 louisiana guardsmen while the pentagon disputes that iraq was a factor , those on the ground say the war has clearly strained a force intended to be the nation s bulwark against natural disasters and terrorist attacks reinforcements from other states' national guard units , slowed by the logistics and red tape involved in summoning troops from civilian jobs and moving them thousands of miles , did not arrive in large numbers until the fourth day after the hurricane passed the coordinating task was so daunting that louisiana officials turned to the pentagon to help organize the appeal for help at the convention center , 222 soldiers trained in levee repair , not police work , locked themselves into an exhibit hall at the convention center rather than challenge an angry and desperate crowd of more than 10 , 000 hurricane victims at the center the neartotal collapse of communications made every task far more difficult , forcing some guard commanders to use runners , like in world war i , as one put it with land lines , cellphones and many satellite phones out of action , the frequencies used by the radios still functioning were often so jammed that they were useless i think the guard has performed admirably unbelievably well based on the conditions that mother nature gave us , col glenn curtis , deputy commander of the state s response to hurricane katrina , said in an interview disaster experts say that whatever the faults in execution , the 5 , 700 troops at the disposal of the louisiana national guard were far too few what do you expect of 5 , 700 soldiers when so much of a state is destroyed \? said james jay carafano , who studies emergency response at the heritage foundation if we want the military to close the 72hour gap in responding to natural disasters , we 'll have to come up with a new model the eventual military response , which climbed to 35 , 000 guardsmen and activeduty troops , was widely judged effective yet questions about the first few days haunt many louisiana guard officials should commanders have moved their headquarters to higher ground before the storm \? could they have better headed off the lawlessness or built more resilient communications \? and especially , could they have moved more troops faster to new orleans and other devastated areas \? i think to a man , we will live with the pain of this experience , said col douglas mouton , commander of 2 , 500 guard engineers the restoration of order at the convention center , when it came , was phenomenally quick , colonel mouton said i think the frustration we all have the country has is , why could n't it have been done a lot quicker \? it was colonel mouton who made the decision not to send his soldiers into the crowd at the convention center a 41yearold new orleans architect whose own house was destroyed by the flood , colonel mouton defended that decision but said the scenes of anguish that became an international emblem of american failure were particularly painful for local guardsmen these are fellow new orleanians who are suffering , he said , people that i go to mardi gras parades with when the storm hit , 4 , 000 louisiana guardsmen were on duty , including 1 , 250 in new orleans and surrounding parishes , guard officials said by the next day , all 5 , 700 available guard members were dispersed around the state , they said the senior commander of national guard troops at the pentagon , lt gen h steven blum , said the iraq deployment did not slow the hurricane response he said that louisiana guard troops were in the water and on the streets throughout the affected areas rescuing people within four hours of katrina s passing , and that outofstate troops arrived as soon as they could be mustered but state guard commanders disagreed we would have used them if we 'd had them , said lt col pete schneider , a spokesman for the louisiana guard we 've always known in the event of a catastrophic storm in new orleans that we 'd use our resources up pretty fast there is little disagreement that guard equipment sent to iraq , particularly hundreds of highwater trucks , fuel trucks and satellite phones , could have helped speed the response the chairmen of the senate national guard caucus , christopher s bond , republican of missouri , and patrick j leahy , democrat of vermont , said in a sept 13 letter to mr bush that the guard nationally had only 34 percent of its equipment available for use in the united states with about 150 highwater trucks available statewide , guard commanders placed most of them outside the danger zone at bases more than two hours' drive from new orleans they risked parking 20 trucks at the lowlying jackson barracks so they could be immediately available even though the national hurricane center warned that hurricane katrina might be catastrophic , they did not consider setting up headquarters elsewhere in 10 years with the guard , said col tom beron , who oversees most of the guard s trucks and drivers , he had never seen more than a few inches of water on the grounds and none inside the buildings but by midmorning on aug 29 , as the flood approached the second floor of an armory where 35 truck mechanics , many of them unable to swim , had found refuge , colonel beron decided they needed to get out of that building the trucks were useless there s not a truck in the us army arsenal that could get through that water , colonel beron said after ferrying the mechanics to the threestory headquarters building in a borrowed fishing boat , guardsmen grabbed civilian neighbors as they floated past it was best to have a rope tied to you , because the water would just carry you away , colonel curtis said the relocation of the guard command on aug 30 to the superdome from the flooded barracks assured attention to the huge crowd there but as word arrived the next evening of the ballooning numbers at the convention center , commanders felt they had no soldiers to spare by happenstance , there were guardsmen at the convention center backhoe operators , truck drivers and mechanics who had chosen a huge exhibit hall to stage their heavy equipment of the 222 there , almost none were trained in police work or riot control many did not have weapons , said colonel mouton , the engineers' commander we did n't expect a martial law situation , he said we were building levees thirsty , hungry civilians began banging on the doors but commanders decided opening them would pose a danger of a stampede we understand we 're soldiers , colonel mouton said but what we had at the convention center was a partially armed group of engineers , ready to operate equipment , and with enough food and water to anger 20 , 000 people on sept 1 , he withdrew the engineers to the superdome aware that the guard would be stretched thin , state officials had contacted other states two days before the storm hit about sending troops under an agreement called the emergency management assistance contract the day the storm hit , gov kathleen babineaux blanco of louisiana asked president bush for all the help he could provide after touring new orleans by helicopter the next day , she asked general blum , of the national guard bureau at the pentagon , to speed and coordinate aid from other states some states got troops there quickly sgt lawrence ouellette , a rhode island guardsman who works as a police officer , was in court in central falls , ri , on aug 31 , when he got the call just 24 hours later , he and his fellow soldiers had flown to a base near new orleans and then flew by helicopter to the superdome to help at least one governor , bill richardson of new mexico , has complained publicly that his early offer of help went unanswered officials said new mexico offered 200 guard members the day the storm hit , and the troops were packed and ready to move the next day but no orders were received to move those troops until two days later , sept 1 , and 400 soldiers finally flew to the hurricane zone on sept 2 at the pentagon , national guard officials offered no explanation for the apparent delay an officer not involved in the specific case said the reasons might include lack of aircraft and housing for the troops or uncertainty about their mission in the weeks since the military presence brought order to the gulf coast , officials in washington and statehouses have suggested that the statecontrolled national guard is no match for a disaster on the scale of hurricane katrina some have suggested that the military have a domestic force ready for instant deployment , while others say the pentagon should simply assume responsibility for communications and other support services defense secretary donald h rumsfeld said yesterday that he expected a debate on the military s role it s up to the country , the government , to think that through and decide how they want to be arranged for a catastrophic event , mr rumsfeld said denise bottcher , press secretary to governor blanco , said state officials supported such a rethinking every piece of emergency preparedness , including the military , should be scrutinized , ms bottcher said there should be some examination of how we can do this better
for the fox network , the television season so far has amounted to a limbo contest how low can they go \? that question relates both to the network s ratings , which have dropped precipitously , and its program content , which may have hit a new bottom this week with who s your daddy \? , a reality series that featured a contestant , who turned out to be a onetime actress in a softcore pornographic film , trying to identify her birth father in a quest for 100 , 000 \( it too bombed in the ratings \) but as has been the case consistently in recent years , the apparently beleaguered fox network may have its competitors right where it wants them even with a primetime schedule that has seen almost nothing work from september to january , fox can still contend for some version of first place in the annual ratings race when the results are released in may this almost mindboggling turn of events is a function of several factors , beginning with the general closeness of the network ratings , but mainly based in the quirks of fox s program schedule that lineup is backloaded with blockbuster attractions like the super bowl and the next edition of american idol , a runaway reality hit the super bowl is not an annual fox property , of course , but the network needs it especially now , because of the pit it dug for itself in the past four months it is a deeper hole because we did n't have a sixgame world series this year we only got four games , said preston beckman , the executive vice president of program planning for fox the baseball reference is central to fox s circumstances baseball gives fox s entertainment executives a difficult challenge because it interrupts the fall launches of new series for three weeks in october but at the same time , fox s postseason baseball coverage has provided ratings that have kept the network from sliding totally into the abyss consider fox s current position the network has lost about 8 percent of its viewers from a year ago \( 85 million , down from 92 million \) , but fox , like nbc and abc , cares most about viewers between ages 18 and 49 because advertisers pay a premium to reach that group there , fox is off even more 11 percent , dropping to a 33 rating from 37 a rating point in the 18to49 category is worth about 13 million viewers in reality \( and that word cuts several ways in fox s case \) , the picture is considerably worse of all the primetime shows on fox this fall , only one , the 16yearold hit the simpsons , has a rating well above the network s average , a 46 in that 18to49 category one reality series , nanny 911 , has a 34 , and another , trading spouses , has a 33 every other show fox has put on this fall is below the network s own average rating that is a woeful overall performance , though to be fair , there are a few bright spots the oc has established a beachhead on hypercompetitive thursday nights a new drama , house , has scored passable ratings despite a puny leadin from a reality flop , the rebel billionaire that last point has largely been the story for fox this season the network has paid a heavy price for overloading on reality shows , most of which have misfired badly we obviously miscalculated the appetite for unscripted shows , mr beckman said at least some of that change in appetite may have had to do with the type of reality fox has specialized in humiliation shows it certainly seems like the viewers have gravitated to the feelgood shows this fall and rejected the humiliation shows , said steve sternberg , senior vice president at magna global usa , a media buying firm it is not as if no reality series worked this fall abc has a breakthough hit with extreme makeover home edition , which features downontheirluck families receiving swank new homes \( accompanied by many tears \) and nbc s biggest loser , which celebrates the efforts of the overweight to change their lives , has also been a success but fox , which captured the nation s nasty imagination in the past with temptation island , joe millionaire and my big fat obnoxious fianc , hit the skids this year with the daddy show , the swan 2 and my big fat obnoxious boss obnoxiousness seems out of favor fox also saw its boxing reality series , the next great champ , fail , and the billionaire series with the entrepreneur richard branson has been a ratings albatross but instead of facing a reckoning for these missteps , fox again seems poised to wreak a little havoc beyond idol and football , fox is also counting on a strong comeback for 24 , the muchadmired drama , which returns sunday and monday with the first four of 24 hours of original episodes , as well as new episodes of the simple life , featuring paris hilton and nicole ritchie taking on various jobs as interns but american idol is still the network s ticket to ride this time fox is conceding the show , which starts its multinight \( as many as three hours a week \) run on jan 18 , could soften ever so slightly , given how other reality hits have fared the other networks expect fox to splatter idol all over its schedule in a desperate effort to get back in the ratings game but while fox will use idol a lot more than 40 hours' worth its executives say they will not expand the number of total hours of idol this season besides , mr beckman asked , how is it different for fox to rely on 40plus hours of its top franchise , while cbs and nbc rely on more than 60 hours each of csi and law order editions mr sternberg noted that fox is indeed still within hailing distance in the 18to49 race cbs , which is winning in that category too , has locked up the competition for total viewers no matter what fox does , cbs is going to have the lion s share of bragging rights this season but the super bowl alone is likely to push fox past abc and nbc into second place in early february in that 18to49 competition fox got a break , mr sternberg said the network that was below it last season , abc , has improved rather than the network that was above it , nbc , which has declined if it was nbc that improved , fox would have no chance to catch up the rub for fox is that its overall schedule still looks like patchwork few or none of the shows that it will ride to its expected comeback will be back in the fall the super bowl wo n't be back idol and 24 will be off again until january and fox s competitors have noted that much of the network s ratings strength comes from sporting events so , they argue , an upset fox victory in prime time , should it occur , would be based largely on an audience rented at very high rates from its sports division would such a win mean anything \? it certainly would not mean as much as it will to cbs , which expects a financial bonanza leslie moonves , the cbs chairman , has said his network should realize hundreds of millions in additional revenues thanks to its performance this season those are the numbers that count most in the television business but fox will likely have a lot of points on the board from another fourthquarter comeback to brag about
paris , oct 12 two years ago , in an uncharacteristic nod toward multilateralism , the bush administration ended a 19yearlong american boycott of unesco today , the united states risks total isolation in the 191member organization as the sole country opposing a new convention on cultural diversity until recently , differences had focused on obscure diplomatic phrases but in the countdown to a final vote next week , negotiations have grown increasingly bitter , with the dispute now assuming political significance and even raising questions about the future role of the united states at unesco the convention s supporters argue that the treaty will protect and promote cultural diversity in the face of cultural globalization , but the united states believes it is intended to restrict exports of american audiovisual products , particularly hollywood movies and television programs next thursday , when the convention is finally to be put to a vote at the headquarters of the united nations educational , scientific and cultural organization in paris , everything suggests that the united states will be the only country to vote against it in fact , the united states has already stood alone on three recent procedural votes related to the convention , its position was successively defeated by 54 to 1 , 53 to 1 and 158 to 1 lastminute lobbying is still under way to avoid a oneagainstall outcome , with the 25nation european union , whose current president is britain , urging the united states to join the consensus embarrassed to be at loggerheads with washington , britain insists that the convention poses none of the dangers identified by the bush administration but washington is not convinced last week , secretary of state condoleezza rice wrote to member governments expressing deep concern about the convention , calling for postponement of its adoption and warning that it will only undermine unesco s image and sow confusion and conflict rather than cooperation sponsored by france and canada , two countries that have long used subsidies and quotas to help their movie , television and radio industries to hold back american popular culture , the convention was inspired by a desire to shield culture from international agreements to liberalize trade but the final draft falls short of original intentions indeed , without teeth to enforce its principles , many experts expect the convention to have little impact on what is already a globalized market for cultural products , one in which india s bollywood , japanese animation movies and brazilian and mexican television soap operas have a place alongside hollywood blockbusters the united states nonetheless believes that the final draft is open to misunderstandings that could allow governments to control culture , even through censorship , and to block the free flow of ideas and information , its euphemism for hollywood s exports in one sense , of course , another negative american vote next week will change little the convention will be adopted and , once ratified by 30 countries , will go into effect the united states will not sign it and , as with the kyoto protocol climate treaty and the treaty creating the international criminal court , will probably remain a critical and perhaps obstructionist outsider more worrisome to some unesco officials , however , is the political damage caused by a convention that , years hence , may join many other international treaties in oblivion in their view , the convention s principal significance is as a symbol of how the united states and some of its closest allies view the world differently and not only on culture given the relative weakness of the final draft , there are even some who argue that the convention needs american opposition without it , there might be little reason to proclaim victory over cultural homogeneity l'am ricaine the key question now is whether , finding itself isolated , the united states will retaliate by , say , cutting its monetary contribution to the organization , which is 22 percent of unesco s budget unesco is not without friends in washington , where its educational programs enjoy support but congressional critics of the united nations , who opposed the american return to unesco , may feel vindicated
washington , feb 21 when representative jim mccrery raised questions about president bush s plan to overhaul social security , the white house quickly put the squeeze on him four of the president s men descended on capitol hill to pay a visit to mr mccrery , an unassuming louisiana republican , surrounding him with charts and figures in a fevered effort to get him to endorse the company line it worked sort of mr mccrery , the chairman of house subcommittee on social security , still says the plan will be a tough sell on capitol hill but , in a subtle shift that mollified the people at the other end of pennsylvania avenue , he is now careful to add that congress should give it a chance i still think it s going to be difficult , mr mccrery said last week , reflecting on the reeducation session but we ought to shop it around the visit from white house officials , led by allan b hubbard , the new director of president bush s national economic council , is testimony to the growing influence of mr mccrery , a littleknown lawmaker who has emerged , seemingly out of nowhere , as a central figure in the social security debate softspoken and bespectacled in a gray pinstriped suit , with a wry sense of humor that slips out when people least expect it , he sometimes gives off the air of an actuary or an academic , and seems illsuited to the backslapping world of the capitol his home state , louisiana , has a long history of colorful politicians , but mr mccrery is not one of them boring , he said drolly , when asked what word most people would use to describe him he s gray and like a book , said buddy roemer , the former louisiana governor who once served in congress , where he employed mr mccrery as an aide yet what he lacks in flamboyance , mr mccrery makes up for in ambition at 54 , he has spent 16 years in congress mastering the intricacies of policy and building alliances with the powerful he is the most trusted lieutenant of representative bill thomas , the mercurial chairman of the house ways and means committee , who will have a huge say over social security legislation with mr thomas as his mentor , mr mccrery has quietly worked his way into the right place at the right time now he is there the chairman of the social security panel , in a year when social security is the hottest issue in town and people in washington , from reporters to lobbyists to the occupant of 1600 pennsylvania avenue , are hanging on his words he is not certain he enjoys it it s an interesting phenomenon , he said on being asked whether he felt as if he was being watched it s one i 've felt , and it s obviously part of my being during the day as i go through the day but i have n't really just sat and said , 'hmmm , all these people are watching me ' yet they are chairman mccrery is very important to the effort , trent duffy , a spokesman for president bush said , shortly after the white house sent mr hubbard to see mr mccrery he has been down here on the president s invitation several times before the meeting , mr mccrery worried aloud that mr bush s plan to allow younger workers to divert payroll taxes into personal retirement accounts would give democrats and aarp , the lobbying group for older americans , an opportunity to attack republicans as trying to undermine the social security trust fund after the meeting , he emerged to tell reporters that he was convinced the president s approach is worth pursuing flippityfloppity , the journalist joshua micah marshall crowed , writing on his web log it shows how difficult it is for a republican tied into this administration to be independent , said representative sander m levin , democrat of michigan howard wolfson , a democratic strategist , said , it s good news for democrats that the republicans have to spend so much time shoring up jim mccrery mr mccrery insists that he did not flipflop i was being as honest as i could be , he declared , in his usual eventempered way , adding that as an ardent proponent of personal accounts , he did not need shoring up but with democrats holding fast against mr bush s proposal , and the republican rank and file sounding a bit nervous , the white house knows it cannot afford to lose mr mccrery he s the one thomas listens to , said john b breaux , a former democratic senator from louisiana and mr mccrery cannot afford to lose the white house he has aspirations to become ways and means chairman , one of the most powerful jobs on capitol hill , when mr thomas s term is up in 2006 , and he knows that his future could hinge on the social security debate with congress in recess this week , republicans must go back to their constituents to sell mr bush s plan if mr mccrery sounds skeptical , they might have a tough time doing it he has to be seen as an unflinching advocate of the president s proposal for personal accounts because that is the biggest thing on the conservative agenda , said stephen moore , former president of the club for growth , an antitax group the real question is , is he working behind the scenes and in front of the cameras to help make this a legislative reality \? working behind the scenes is mr mccrery s forte as president of his fraternity at louisiana tech university , he wanted to raise money for a new house his social chairman , bobby waddell , wanted a share for the party fund mr waddell , now a district court judge in shreveport , the northern louisiana city mr mccrery represents , said mr mccrery quietly brokered a compromise he did his homework on getting the votes , mr waddell said like many republicans from traditionally democratic louisiana , mr mccrery was once a democrat a lawyer by training , he worked in the early 1980 s for mr roemer , then a congressional democrat , and went on to become a lobbyist for the timber industry in 1988 , he ran as a republican for the seat mr roemer had vacated to become governor mr mccrery won , becoming the first republican to represent the district in 114 years he was headed for defeat until his opponent , a state legislator named foster campbell , was injured in a car crash mr mccrery pulled his advertising and became known as gentleman jim , a label that fit a personality his consultants had tried in vain to revamp i had advisers telling me to do this or do that , mr mccrery said i said , 'look , i am who i am i'm not going to change i'm not going to buy a pair of cowboy boots , i'm not going to wear blue jeans i do n't own a pair of blue jeans if i ca n't win based on who i am , then i should n't win ' mr campbell , now a public utilities commissioner , describes mr mccrery as a real clean guy , a straight , strict republican who is too probusiness for democrats' taste if it ever comes between big business and people , he said , it s easy to figure out where jim mccrery s going to be mr mccrery makes no apologies i believe very strongly in capitalism , he said so strongly that he named his political action committee the committee for the preservation of capitalism the committee raised 13 million during the 2004 election cycle nearly as much as one founded by nancy pelosi , the democratic leader of the house and contributed heavily to other republicans , winning mr mccrery friends who will come in handy as he tries to ascend the leadership ladder and he is trying , hard absolutely , he said , asked if he wanted the ways and means chairmanship told that colleagues say he will probably get it , he remarked , deadpan who has not told you that \? i would like to know mr mccrery says he loves being a congressman , yet he almost walked away last year torn between his job in washington and his wife and two young sons back in shreveport , he told republican leaders he would not seek reelection i was gone , he said , though he changed his mind when the family decided to move to the capital as the mccrerys agonized over their future , supporters back home offered housing , a job for his wife , even a private plane to make the commute quicker mr mccrery said he turned them down all kinds of offers came in the door , he said , none of which was legal after nearly two decades in congress , mr mccrery has decided that his future is in the house he has passed up at least two chances to run for the senate , and does not seem much interested in being governor as the social security debate moves forward , he says , his goal is to get a bill to mr bush by the end of the year but he is also a realist mostly , he is hoping to keep his reputation , and his future , intact if we get a bill to the president , or we do n't get a bill to the president , he said , i hope at the end of this , people wo n't say , 'jim mccrery is the one who messed this up '
philadelphia , miss , jan 8 for nearly all his life , mark duncan has lived under the cloud of one of the nation s most infamous unresolved crimes , the killing of three civil rights workers along a muddy road near this town 40 years ago but on friday , mr duncan , now the district attorney for neshoba county and three others , took a long step toward lifting that cloud , charging a 79yearold preacher and sawmill operator , edgar ray killen , with the murders standing before a courtroom packed with reporters , civil rights advocates and mr killen s family , mr duncan read the charges to the stooped , fraillooking defendant dressed in an orange jailhouse jumpsuit , mr killen mumbled his answers in a brief interview with the judge until he was asked how he would plead not guilty , mr killen said in a suddenly forceful voice the 1964 killing of the three civil rights workers andrew goodman , michael h schwerner and james e chaney and the inability , or unwillingness , of state and local prosecutors to bring charges in the case had left many here wondering whether the town s image would forever be tainted by a single unsolved crime outside court after the arraignment on friday , mr duncan , 45 , who has lived here his entire life , said he did not push for an indictment because he wanted to heal the town s old wound but , he added , if that s what it does , i'm all for it mr killen , whom officials describe as a former ku klux klan leader , runs his own sawmill business and owns a 20acre farm outside town he was being held without bail at the neshoba county jail he told judge marcus gordon of circuit court that he could not afford a lawyer , but the judge refused to appoint one for him , ordering a bond hearing for wednesday immediately after the arraignment , the courthouse was evacuated because of a bomb threat as people poured onto the street , mr killen s brother knocked down a television cameraman get all of your shots now , the brother , jd killen , said we 're going to make sure you 're not around for his funeral my brother s innocent edgar killen was among 18 people who were originally charged in 1967 with federal civil rights violations in the deaths seven were convicted , but mr killen was released after an allwhite jury became deadlocked and while eight of the original defendants are still alive , mr duncan said he did not expect that anyone else would be charged in the case he suggested that evidence had been presented against others , but that the grand jury had declined to indict anyone other than mr killen but a spokesman for attorney general jim hood of mississippi said that the investigation remained open and that more charges could be brought if new evidence emerged the indictment of mr killen is just the latest of several cases brought by southern prosecutors over the last decade involving unresolved killings from the civil rights movement of the 1960 s in 1994 , byron de la beckwith was convicted of the 1963 assassination of medgar evers , a field secretary for the national association for the advancement of colored people in 1998 , sam bowers , the onetime imperial wizard of the white knights of the ku klux klan , was convicted of ordering a 1966 firebombing in hattiesburg , miss , that killed vernon dahmer , a prominent civil rights leader and in the spring of 2002 , bobby frank cherry was convicted of killing four girls in a church basement in birmingham , ala , in 1963 but it has remained something of a mystery as to why state and county prosecutors have been unable to bring murder charges in the killings of the three men , who worked for the congress of racial equality the murders had a profound effect on the civil rights movement , generating national sympathy for the cause , prodding president lyndon b johnson to become more aggressive about investigating the klan and causing some civil rights workers to lose faith in the nonviolent philosophy of the rev dr martin luther king jr federal officials gathered enough evidence to prosecute 18 men in 1967 on charges of violating the civil rights of the three slain men the men who were convicted were sentenced to prison terms ranging from 3 years to 10 years , although none served more than 6 years mr killen was released after a holdout juror said she could not convict a preacher defendants in the 1967 case told investigators that mr killen had helped recruit and organize the klan party that authorities say hunted down , beat and shot the three civil rights workers on june 21 , 1964 , before burying them under a clay berm outside town yet prosecutors declined to file state murder charges at the time mr duncan did little to clear up the mystery on friday , declining to answer questions about what prompted the decision to empanel the grand jury he added that the prosecution would rely in part on evidence from the 1967 federal trial but leaders of a group of local business , civic and civil rights organizations , who have been pushing for charges in the case over the last year said they believed that mr hood , the attorney general , played a major role in pushing for the charges james e prince iii , the publisher of the weekly neshoba democrat and a leader of the group , said mr hood came to a potluck dinner at a local church last september to meet mr goodman s mother , dr carolyn goodman of manhattan over roast beef , pulled pork and corn , dr goodman spoke calmly but forcefully for the need to bring closure to the case , mr prince said it had to have had some impact on the attorney general , mr prince said three months later , the grand jury was empaneled in philadelphia but a spokesman for mr hood said the decision to prosecute was not based on outside pressure from groups like mr prince s over the four decades since the killings , mr killen remained a wellknown if somewhat reclusive figure he has lived with his wife in a modest ranch house where the front yard is adorned with a tabletshaped board displaying the ten commandments he continued preaching at a small church and ran a sawmill that employed several black workers , people who know him said but he has also given interviews in which he has shown little sorrow for the three dead men in an interview with the new york times six years ago , mr killen called the three men communists who were threatening mississippi s way of life i'm sorry they got themselves killed , he said but i ca n't show remorse for something i did n't do and in a 1999 interview with the clarionledger of jackson , miss , mr killen said he believed that the bible taught that separation of the races was holy and applauded the killing of dr king he also denied that he was a member of the klan philadelphia , a town of more than 7 , 000 people , has changed significantly since the 1960 s blacks own prominent businesses and have been elected to public office the silver star resort and casino , owned by the choctaw indians , has generated jobs and a steady stream of visitors with a new , more integrated generation of residents , the town is more likely to produce a jury that will convict mr killen when he goes on trial , probably this summer , some people said but there were reservations at a barbershop near the courthouse , the proprietors , stacy adkins and chad young , said they had mixed feelings about the indictment both called the crime abhorrent but both wondered about the ethics of prosecuting an aged , hardofhearing man and both worried that the trial might stir up old passions the south already has a bad reputation , said mr adkins , 30 this is n't going to help us live it down across the street , joe mulholland , 68 , a lawyer who has lived here all his life , also fretted that the case might rekindle stereotypes of mississippi as a hotbed of racism we 've changed since then , he said , fingering a yellowing file folder on his cluttered desk i just hope there s some closure and that we can move on mr prince , 40 , said he believed such sentiments were inevitable , and perhaps healthy you 've got to open the wound and clean it before it can heal , he said it s as if we 've had this open gash on the arm for 40 years and have done nothing but put a bandage on it
mihail kogalniceanu air base , romania , dec 8 as the furor over the cia s reported use of eastern european countries in the transfer or torture of terrorism suspects rippled across europe this week , romania s president made an offer he hoped would dispel suggestions that his country was involved speaking after secretary of state condoleezza s rice s visit here , president traian basescu announced wednesday , if there is the wish by anyone to visit any place suspected to be destined for detention and torture , romania puts at their disposition its entire territory and so on thursday , a small group of reporters gathered at mihail kogalniceanu air base , north of constanza , on the black sea it is here that planes used by the central intelligence agency landed , according to an interpretation of flight records by human rights watch , and could have funneled a group of suspected members of al qaeda for detention and possible interrogation dressed in green slacks and a romanian air force bomber jacket , lt cmdr adrian vasile was on hand to take around anyone who wished just name it and we can go there , he said nonchalantly , standing in front of a row of unused sovietera mig29 fighter planes since 1996 kogalniceanu has been the main air base for joint exercises by romanian and american forces in 2003 it was used as a refueling depot for american aircraft flying to northern iraq according to the romanians , there are no permanent american military facilities here in the base s 104 buildings , set in a bleak landscape of rolling barren hills , there seemed to be any number of possible places to lock up detainees but there were none of the white huts that the american army often uses for barracks , or the temporary containers and wire mesh seen at guant namo bay , cuba there is a former missile storage area that can be locked securely , commander vasile said a drive at breakneck speed down the apron of the runway took the assembled news corps to a long concrete building , painted in camouflage green , with large metal sliding doors one by one , commander vasile opened the doors , revealing a series of empty rooms should evidence surface that romania facilitated the transfer of prisoners or more seriously , their detention the consequences could be serious romania , a former communist state , is hoping to join the european union in 2007 any evidence that it knowingly helped the cia detain suspects on its territory could damage its relations with the 25member union at a critical time the council of europe , which has a mandate to examine human rights abuses across europe , has said it wants to examine satellite photographs of kogalniceanu and a polish air base to determine if any detention centers had been established but the seriousness of the allegations appears to be lost on many romanians , who , after shedding 55 years of sovietstyle rule , are fiercely proamerican it s a joke , said capt cmdr puiu vlad , the leader of a helicopter squadron based at the airport commander vasile , a liaison with american forces when they visit the airport , was more than happy to show reporters aerial photographs taken by the romanian air force a 20minute slide show offered views of the runway and surrounding buildings , and pictures of the joint romanianamerican exercises held in the last two years the bottom of each slide was marked not secret in romanian
rebel samurai the japanese call them chambara eiga , or swordfight films , while the rest of the world refers to them , imprecisely but unshakably , as samurai movies as one learns quickly when one dives into this very deep pool , samurai is only one rank among many in the militarized world of feudal japan , where every individual is assigned a strict position in a social hierarchy \( the films are usually set in the edo period , 1603 to 1867 \) many heroes of samurai films including those of the swordfight film most famous in the west , akira kurosawa s seven samurai from 1954 are actually ronin these are professional soldiers without clan loyalty who roam the countryside involving themselves in local conflicts or personal vendettas , trying to scrape together a living from their skills in violence dramatically , ronin are much more compelling figures than the professionally and philosophically conformist samurai , and americans love them because we have grown up with them , too only we call them gunslingers and locate them in our own safely distanced edo period , the old west westerns and chambara share many obvious parallels , and several new ones emerge with rebel samurai sixties swordplay classics , a box set of four chambara from the late 1960 s recently issued by the criterion collection though chambara had been a staple of the japanese cinema since its beginnings , it is the implied thesis of this collection that the social unrest of the 60 s brought the genre new meanings and elevated it to new heights a form that once played on japanese nostalgia for a lost , wellordered past became a vehicle for the antiauthoritarian and individualist impulses that had been building in japan since the end of world war ii the four films in the rebel samurai set reflect a growing dissatisfaction with established power structures and a greater emphasis on personal freedom samurai rebellion , made in 1967 by masaki kobayashi , offers a thematic sequel to his groundbreaking harakiri of 1962 with its story of a loyal retainer \( played by the chambara superstar toshiro mifune \) who stoically accepts the injustices of the feudal system until his clan lord tries to claim his son s bride as his own samurai rebellion takes place in a world where bushido , the samurai s unwritten code of excruciatingly correct behavior , is still very much in effect his sense of selfcontrol reinforced by kobayashi s metronome pacing and tightly symmetrical visuals , mifune s character unflinchingly endures each new humiliation heaped upon him , until finally it is too much and he resolves to resist his master s command , even though it will mean the annihilation of him and his family if kobayashi represents the high version of the genre , his contemporary , hideo gosha , enthusiastically embraces the low sword of the beast \( 1965 \) is a roughedged , rollicking film that takes place not in stately courtyards but in the brothels , gambling dens and cheap hotels that ring a mountain where a gold rush is in progress his hero , gennosuke \( mikijiro hira \) , is an illkempt former samurai who was used as an assassin in a court intrigue and then cynically discarded gosha almost gleefully documents gennosuke s slide into selfinterest and greed as he makes his way through this corrupt and corrupting environment it s easy to imagine sergio leone remaking sword of the beast as a spaghetti western , just as he remade kurosawa s yojimbo as a fistful of dollars in 1964 the same is true of masahiro shinoda s samurai spy \( 1965 \) , which adds ninjas and pervasive paranoia to the mix , and kihachi okamoto s bluntly absurdist kill ! \( 1965 \) , starring the sloeeyed genre favorite , tatsuya nakadai the latter film , according to criterion s notes , was itself influenced by italian westerns , thus closing the circle of disillusionment the rebel samurai box carries a list price of 9995 the films are available individually at 2995 none has been rated by the motion picture association of america the sabata trilogy though he carries a rifle instead of a sword , lee van cleef s sabata is clearly a ronin of the old west released in 1969 , sabata was a bid by the producer alberto grimaldi to extend the franchise of van cleef s characters in the leone westerns for a few dollars more \( 1965 \) and the good , the bad and the ugly \( 1966 \) , which mr grimaldi had produced indeed , under the bumptious direction of frank kramer \( the americanized pseudonym of the italian action veteran gianfranco parolini \) , sabata had little to offer beyond the saurian charisma of van cleef and an oddly festive atmosphere , in which the presence of acrobats and musicians contributes to the commedia dell'arte feeling sabata was successful enough to spawn two sequels adios , sabata \( 1971 \) , in which van cleef was replaced by yul brynner in the leading role , and return of sabata \( also 1971 \) , which lured van cleef back to the part all three films have been gathered in a slim box set by mgm dvd \( now owned and distributed by sony pictures home entertainment \) , where they look good and go down easy 3595 sabata is rated pg the others are pg13 le samourai and then there s the french take on the ronin figure , as elegantly embodied by alain delon in jeanpierre melville s 1968 masterpiece , le samourai melville s film begins with an invented quote from the bushido , a book that does n't exist , and moves into a chambaraready plot about a professional hit man whose code of honor drives him to avenge himself on a treacherous employer but for melville , one of the cinema s great eccentrics , the japanese reference served mainly as an excuse to add a further level of abstraction to his already highly stylized interpretation of the american gangster film minimal dialogue , a spare and moody jazz score and images drained of any color warmer than blue steel contribute to an overwhelming sense of repression and control shot almost entirely in the small studio melville had built for himself in paris , the film constructs an alternative universe that has little room for emotion and no tolerance for its overt expression this criterion release is a vast improvement over the disc released in france , with much improved definition and satisfyingly deep blacks many gifted filmmakers , from walter hill \( the driver \) to john woo \( the killer \) , have tried to enter melville s private world over the years , but the territory still belongs to him 2995 not rated
to the editor while i agree with your chiding of president bush for not going along with europe by significantly increasing aid to africa , the reality is that none of the aid , including the things listed in your editorial \( like mosquito netting to prevent malaria or programs to get boys off the streets in ghana \) will make poverty history the root causes of the problems facing africa are not being addressed there are only pleas for more money and aid to pour in from around the world , as it has done for many years yes , more immediate aid is necessary to alleviate the suffering of africans , but let s not fool ourselves into thinking that it will eliminate poverty or solve africa s numerous problems dennis andrade boston , june 8 , 2005
jupiter , fla , march 16 about 30 minutes before the mets were to play the florida marlins on wednesday , ominouslooking clouds began to form beyond the leftfield fence at roger dean stadium for pedro mart nez , who had been rained out of his last two scheduled starts , that was too familiar a sight but the rain held off , and mart nez allowed three hits in three shutout innings , walking none and striking out two in a 43 mets victory he is on schedule to start the regularseason opener and that was the good news for the mets on a day when the other news ranged from bad to debatable the mets' worst fears about their projected no 5 starter , steve trachsel , were confirmed , with general manager omar minaya disclosing that trachsel , the 34yearold righthander , has a herniated disk in his back and had decided to have surgery , which will sideline him for at least three months the operation is scheduled for saturday morning at st vincent medical center in los angeles minaya said that trachsel , who went 1213 last season with a 400 earned run average , sounded very determined about pitching again this season and issued a statement backing up that sentiment but the mets may have to assume that he will not be available in 2005 and are expected to move quickly to find a no 5 starter for their rotation , perhaps from within the team the absence of trachsel increases the pressure on the team s four other starters to pitch well one of those four , victor zambrano , was clobbered by the los angeles dodgers last friday night , giving up seven runs and five walks in two and twothirds inning and on wednesday , he did not do much better he surrendered seven hits and three runs in four innings against the marlins , yielding a 400foot home run to carlos delgado on his first pitch still , the pitching coach rick peterson said that zambrano , whom the mets acquired last season in a controversial trade for the highly rated pitching prospect scott kazmir , had made progress peterson graded zambrano at 79 percent in his complicated efficiency ratings he deems 68 percent as acceptable and particularly liked that zambrano pitched out of a basesloaded , noout situation you 're sitting there thinking , 'man , bases loaded , nobody out , ' peterson said but then he made some great pitches he came in overthrowing , like he did the other day but then he made some adjustments over all , i'm very encouraged he has n't had a lot of time on the mound since august , peterson added , referring to the elbow injury that curtailed zambrano s 2004 season he s coming off the doubt of the injury factor , plus this is his first spring training with us you can see him getting more confidence as he gets more comfortable with everything around him zambrano threw 68 pitches in wednesday s game and 12 more on the sideline peterson said zambrano was ready to throw up to 90 pitches in his next outing as significant as zambrano is to the mets' hopes this season , mart nez created most of wednesday s excitement he had pitched only three innings this spring and for a while on wednesday it appeared he would remain stuck on that number i was joking with pedro , and i told him , 'maybe you should put a different jersey on when you warm up maybe the weather gods wo n't know it s you , ' peterson said the marlins used only three regulars mike lowell , paul lo duca and delgado and mart nez dominated he threw 46 pitches , 32 for strikes , and looked especially sharp in striking out delgado on eight pitches martinez appeared to point toward delgado after striking him out , but mart nez said his emotion was directed at a fan who kept heckling him with a who s your daddy \? cry , a reference to mart nez s acknowledgement last season that he was having trouble defeating the yankees mart nez even gave a pep talk to shortstop jos reyes , who had a badhop ground ball ricochet off his body for an error reyes is young , and sometimes they are going to feel they have somebody on top of them when they make an error or something goes wrong , mart nez said i 'll be the first one clapping them up and being supportive with kids like that , you have to be patient he added afterward i'm very happy with the way i feel i feel strong i feel consistent i feel like my body has reacted pretty well and i just hope everything continues to be the way it is but zambrano s effort was not as reassuring and the trachsel news , while not unexpected , was depressing for the mets , spring training is getting more complicated inside pitch danny garcia , once thought to be the mets' second baseman of the future , was given his unconditional release by the club on wednesday
las vegas jo l robuchon and his creations travel very nicely , thank you his newest venture , jo l robuchon at the mansion , which opened on monday in the mgm grand hotel here , represents a leap back into the rarefied realm of haute cuisine , from which he retired in 1996 during the tryouts preceding its official debut , the restaurant served the best food in las vegas , by a decisive margin , and some of the very best french food i have ever eaten on this continent this is no revolutionary robuchon , like his ateliers \( including one here and , soon , in new york \) , where one eats at a counter and talks to the chefs it is no casual , scaleddown , moderately priced robuchon , like la table de jo l robuchon in the chic 16th arrondissement , and its counterparts in monte carlo and asia this is fullscale , damnthetorpedoes , threestarsorbust robuchon , worldly , luxurious , costly getting there is none of the fun you walk through the crass clamor of hundreds of slot machines , past a starbucks and other lesser diversions and into a bombastic stone doorway more suited to a central bank than a casino but inside you are in paris , in a subdued neodeco room lighted by a glamorous swarovski crystal chandelier , furnished with handsome chairs in the fashion of ruhlmann and graced by lalique vases a small glass of lemon gel e flavored with vanilla and topped with an anisetteinfused cream sets the tone straight away a complex , entirely original and appetiterousing prelude to the many delights that lie ahead , and a vivid demonstration of the french master s familiar maxim that three tastes in any one dish are quite enough mr robuchon s arrival signals another step in the evolution of las vegas as a culinary capital , and the onset of a struggle between two visions of its future will it specialize in a kind of ghost cuisine , conceived but seldom cooked by absentee chefs who made their names elsewhere , or will it nurture its own kitchen superstars \? steve wynn , whose gigantic new 27 billion casino opened in the summer of 2005 , helped put las vegas on the world s gastronomic map in 1998 when he lured luminaries like julian serrano , alessandro strata and sirio maccioni to the mirage and bellagio , the las vegas resorts he then owned mr serrano and mr strata moved here , and their food profited from their daily attention but many of the chefs and restaurateurs who followed in their profitable wake did little more than phone in menus mr wynn said that one evening in 2000 he ran into jeangeorges vongerichten at prime , the bellagio steakhouse that bears mr vongerichten s imprimatur mr vongerichten , who is involved in restaurants in new york and around the world , told the casino boss that it was the first time he had cooked at prime since it opened two years earlier that set mr wynn to thinking , he told me , and he decided that the only thing that matters is who s cooking dinner , not whose name appears on the door as a result , most of the nine finedining restaurants at wynn las vegas \( among 22 food operations \) are run by younger chefs , well known in the cities where they formerly cooked but not nationally celebrated all have relocated to las vegas as a condition of employment , except mr strata , who has moved over from the mirage , and daniel boulud a sense started spreading that something was fishy here , mr wynn said if steve wynn paints a painting he does n't get to sign it picasso so we 're going down a different path it s a bit of adventure , and i admit i'm not sure it 'll work gamal aziz , who ran bellagio s food and beverage operation and who considers mr wynn his mentor , thinks not now the president of mgm grand , the egyptianborn mr aziz is still reaching for stars he persuaded mr robuchon to set up shop here , where the chef is contractually required to spend just two weeks a quarter i think it s an uphill battle to bring in these relatively unknown chefs and introduce them , mr aziz said most of our clients come to the desert for four or five days , not long enough to get used to new faces they want to recognize names i think we gain a competitive advantage by associating ourselves with the very best , and it will not be easy to top jo l robuchon well , guy savoy , another paris heavyweight , holder of three michelin stars , may come close if he wants to his las vegas entry , on the second floor of the new augustus tower at caesars palace , a kitschfest even by las vegas standards , is set to open early in 2006 mr savoy s son , franck , has arrived to oversee it some equally big names have decided not even to pretend to reproduce the food they serve at their home bases at wynn , mr boulud runs a brasserie , not a replica of daniel , his brilliant manhattan establishment \( although the executive chef , philippe rispoli , who grew up near lyon , like mr boulud , makes a roughtextured p t de campagne , unctuous pork and goose rillettes and other dishes that would evoke cheers in new york \) thomas keller transplanted his bistro , bouchon , not the french laundry or per se , to the venetian in las vegas and the omnipresent alain ducasse , with two michelin threestar restaurants , in paris and monte carlo , eschews french classicism for a more populist approach at his local spot , mix , perched on the 64th floor of a tower at mandalay bay with sensational views across sin city , it is much more endearing than its recently departed new york namesake thai beef salad and curried lobster cohabit happily on the menu with the best baba this side of the atlantic , served with a choice of three premium rums hanging from the ceiling , thousands of shimmering venetian glass baubles , said to have cost 500 , 000 , remind you that you are in the world capital of wretched excess trying to replicate a paris threestar on the 64th floor , maybe anywhere in vegas , would have been a big mistake , said john cunin , mix s general manager obviously mr aziz and mr robuchon do n't think so , and for now at least they seem to have brought it off mr robuchon took an almost obsessive interest in the design of the menu and the kitchen and put two seasoned breton friends in daytoday charge lo c launay as general manager , and claude le tohic , who worked at mr robuchon s side during the glory days at jamin in paris , as executive chef mr le tohic holds the title of meilleur ouvrier de france \( best craftsman of france \) , a coveted distinction awarded by a jury of his peers , so no one doubts his credentials seven cooks and six frontofthehouse people also came from robuchon operations in paris and tokyo only time will tell , however , how long they will stay and who will replace them when they go two set menus are offered at jo l robuchon at the mansion , 9 small courses plus coffee for 165 , and 16 small courses plus coffee for 295 many items are also served la carte the 750entry wine list includes risibly expensive items , presumably for those who have hit several jackpots , such as 1978 le montrachet from the domaine de la roman econti at 8 , 845 a bottle but for mere mortals , 2002 pulignymontrachet from dujac at a modest 108 should more than suffice it did so for me though relaxed , service is in the grand french style , with main courses delivered on silver trays \( or carved at table side , in the case of the lobster and turbot and delectable roasted guinea hen with foie gras \) breads , cheeses \( all french , all ripe \) , digestifs and afterdinner treats roll to the table on handsome wooden carts the lighting is subtle , the airconditioning far less overpowering than the las vegas norm the tables are well spaced only 40 people can be seated in the square dining room , centered on a black fireplace with gasfired flames , with room for a dozen more on a side terrace and 10 in a small private room if the gel e amusebouche attested to mr robuchon s unflagging creativity , a millefeuille consisting of two triangular layer cakes of fresh king crab , fuji apple , watercress and bibb lettuce with perfectly fitted tomato lids bespoke his artistry they rested on a red disk formed by a coulis of tomato and p rigord verjus \( unfermented juice of unripe grapes \) , delightful in its balance of acid and fruitiness , with minuscule green dots of parsleyinfused mayonnaise around its circumference so precisely was all this applied , each dish reportedly requiring 20 minutes to complete , that i thought for a second that it was part of the decoration of the plate magic i could not resist trying langoustines , a robuchon specialty , which are not often seen in the united states pulled into tight circles , enveloped in ephemeral ravioli cases with more than a few slivers of truffle , and cooked for only a few instants , these were meltingly sweet and ultratender a hillock of barely steamed baby savoy cabbage shared the plate , along with a slick of glossy veal reduction nothing else the langoustines had been flown across the atlantic , of course , but the milkfed veal was allamerican , from the highly regarded four story hill farm in pennsylvania listed on the menu as a veal chop , it was in fact two rectangles , less than half an inch thick , judiciously cooked to a uniform pink from edge to edge and moistened with deeply flavored pan juices this time the accompanying act was a nest of taglierini made from carrots , zucchini and broccolini and lightly sauced with pesto somebody somewhere may do a more succulent veal dish there are lots of restaurants in this world but if so i have never sampled it everything i ate was thoughtout and free of frivolous gestures each combined delicacy with a certain muscularity of taste in a most unusual equilibrium and each left my palate fresh as the dawn things have gotten off to a bumpy start at wynn its nightclubs are already being revamped , its computer system has been plagued by bugs and one of its regional chefs , jimmy sneed , formerly at the frog and the redneck in richmond , va , left before the resort even opened , after personality clashes and a dispute over what style of food he should cook some of the other restaurants still seem a little ragged , including okada , where the gifted takashi yagahashi cooks europeaninfluenced japanese food the look of the place is a bit of a letdown as well whereas bellagio s lyrically swaying fountains evoke busby berkeley musicals , wynn s ersatz yosemite , waterfalls and all , comes straight out of bmovies but wynn has had its triumphs as well , including alex , the new domain of mr strata and his rich , layered francoitalian food , which is one of the town s handful of truly successful haute cuisine restaurants its two steakhouses are booming , too las vegas has always loved beef from my viewpoint , paul bartolotta s ristorante di mare is as thrilling as it is unexpected an italian seafood trattoria smack in the middle of the american desert although forewarned , i leapt with surprise when he wheeled out a trolley banked with brighteyed orata , branzino , triglia \( red mullet \) , spigola and other fish even ugly , fiery red scorfano , the rascasse so vital to bouillabaisse from venice , sicily , liguria and other maritime parts of italy , which come directly from a milanese broker milwaukeeborn , trained in top kitchens in new york , france and italy , mr bartolotta , 44 , made spiaggia in chicago the best italian restaurant between the coasts when they met , mr wynn said , i wanted a normal italian menu you know , veal piccata but he insisted on doing something different and wore me down so seafood it is steamed mussels with cannellini beans , tender octopus salad , linguine with clams and tomatoes , charcoal grilled lobster or langoustines and those beautiful fish , simply poached or roasted whole with olive oil and perhaps a touch of grapefruit for balance , dressed with herbs and some simple condiment like salsa salmoriglio \( olive oil , lemon , garlic and oregano \) real seaside stuff with a few token meat dishes like rabbit , chicken and rack of lamb no veal piccata i'm shooting for extreme simplicity and explosive flavor , mr bartolotta said , and he is hitting those targets another veteran of the chicago restaurant wars , taiwanborn richard chen , who won acclaim at the peninsula hotel s shanghai terrace in chicago , also seems to have hit his stride in las vegas he cooks westerninflected chinese food at wing lei at wynn , including a fabulous peking duck salad that owes a debt to a similar dish at hakkasan in london , a lobster spring roll , thinly sliced abalone with a spicy green papaya salad and a memorable dungeness crab slowcooked with ginger , scallions and garlic in a clay pot all fine eating and a joy to look at as well , as is the miniature garden that lies just beyond a wallsize window , with a pair of 100year old pomegranate trees and a big black fernando botero sculpture still , the question remains as important as dining has become to las vegas , where gambling now accounts for only 40 percent of revenues , can a rootless place with no indigenous gastronomic traditions and no local raw materials \( except for the odd blood orange and sprig of rosemary \) ever be a great restaurant town , as opposed to a resort town with good restaurants a disneyland for foodies , as the restaurant consultant clark wolf calls it \? i doubt that you will ever have a true food culture here , in the sense that lyon and venice and san francisco have food cultures , commented elizabeth blau , executive vice president for restaurant development at wynn resorts , who is considered one of the savviest food people in the city nothing is local i asked mr aziz whether las vegas is yet a great restaurant city no , not yet , he replied , but we 've made some quantum leaps we 've built a strong foundation , and eventually we 'll get there this is a large , prosperous region now we have the economic means to support not only great restaurants in the casinos , but also the bistros and other places that are popping up in the neighborhoods
to the editor nicholas d kristof \( the secret genocide archive , oped , feb 23 \) writes that unlike the current slaughter in sudan , during past genocides , like the mass murder of european jews by the nazis , it was possible to claim that we did n't fully know what was going on in fact , verification of the nazi genocide was provided by the allied leadership early in the holocaust on dec 17 , 1942 , the governments of the united states , britain , the soviet union and eight nazioccupied countries issued a public statement confirming that the german authorities are now carrying into effect hitler s oftrepeated intention to exterminate the jewish people in europe from all the occupied countries , jews are being transported , in conditions of appalling horror and brutality , to eastern europe in poland , which has been made the principal nazi slaughterhouse , the ghettos established by the german invaders are being systematically emptied of all jews none of those taken away are ever heard from again thus , the roosevelt administration publicly verified the nazi genocide at a time when approximately two million jews had been murdered but millions more were still alive and many could have been saved had the united states acted likewise in sudan today , if america s leaders show the will , ways can still be found to save many lives rafael medoff director , david s wyman institute for holocaust studies melrose park , pa , feb 23 , 2005
zurich with his slickedback hair , brusque manner and squinty gaze , ossie gr bel does not look like a cutup but mr gr bel , the chief executive of the credit suisse group , was amused recently when he found himself the target of a young english banker impersonating ali g , the british rappercuminterviewer who has made a career of lampooning serious white men referring to the leader of credit suisse his full name is oswald j gr bel as uzi gr bel , the ali g lookalike said , that sounds scary does he carry a gun \? mr gr bel , 61 , broke into a broad smile when asked about the incident , which occurred at a rally the troops meeting of 900 credit suisse bankers in orlando , fla the boss , it turns out , has a sense of humor and if enduring a few taunts will help rebuild the morale at his bank s stormtossed subsidiary , credit suisse first boston , then mr gr bel is willing to do it he and his chief lieutenant , brady w dougan , are trying to sell their bankers on yet another turnaround plan after a turbulent four years in which credit suisse first boston , once one of wall street s highest fliers , became perhaps its most dysfunctional major investment bank i was expecting more of a cultural challenge than i found , mr gr bel said of that meeting , in a interview here i was surprised that i had to do less convincing than i thought given first boston s reputation for headstrong bankers and feuding fiefs , mr gr bel s remedy would not seem an easy sell the plan , which he first outlined in december , is to integrate the new york investment bank more closely with its parent in zurich he does not rule out dropping the storied first boston name , though he says it is safe for now by establishing tighter links between credit suisse s wealthy private bank with nearly 1 trillion in assets and its talented , if frustrated , investment bankers and traders , mr gr bel and mr dougan hope to carve out lucrative new markets for first boston their goal is to more than double the firm s profits , and lift its pretax margin by nearly 50 percent , by 2007 and to do it without significantly adding jobs as part of that plan , csfb has created a new type of incentive compensation , which mr dougan says will persuade executives to sign on to the bank s ambitious plan this can be the most financially successful and exciting place to be over the next five years , said mr dougan , a rumpled , downtoearth derivatives trader who emerged last july as first boston s third chief executive in four years analysts are skeptical the plan is very ambitious , said richard ramsden , a banking analyst with goldman sachs in london it will take them longer than the time they have set for themselves still , the mood in orlando , according to bankers who attended the meeting , was generally receptive , if wary in part , that may have to do with the willingness of credit suisse to keep paying its bankers well in part , it may reflect exhaustion with the endless efforts to reinvent the bank after the latest bonus checks cleared , another wave of bankers walked out the door i was impressed with the presentation , said one managing director , who spoke on condition of anonymity the cynicism comes from a rolling set of promises from four people over the last decade , and is well founded in that no one has been able to do it the recent troubles began in 2000 , when the bank merged with donaldson lufkin jenrette that illfated deal started a wave of layoffs and guaranteed pay packages to prevent bankers from leaving when the technology bubble burst , the bank was stuck with these deals then its star dealmaker , frank p quattrone , left the bank and was later convicted on charges of obstructing justice he is appealing that decision numerous regulatory inquiries hurt the franchise last june , credit suisse ousted the bank s charismatic leader , john j mack , who had also been group cochief executive , along with mr gr bel mr mack had clashed with the bank s swiss board by agitating for credit suisse to merge with another financial institution with mr gr bel now the sole chief , such a move does not seem in the cards at the moment , we have nothing in mind , he said , adding , i cannot see any big synergy effect out of these deals mr mack , a former president of morgan stanley , recruited some marquee names to first boston \( some of whom left soon after he did \) facing multiple regulatory investigations and a bloated cost structure , he slashed the bank s head count by 20 percent and its costs by 42 percent he also pulled the bank out of proprietary trading a lucrative , if risky , business in which banks trade with their own funds just as a boom in that business fattened the bottom line of other banks none of this lifted first boston s profits to the level of its top wall street rivals mr gr bel , who got his start as a bond trader in zurich in the 1970 s , and mr dougan are trying to revive first boston by changing its business mix focusing on a handful of strengths and a smaller number of profitable customers you have to specialize , mr gr bel said you cannot be good in everything because there is too much transparency the market has become more transparent , which means more competitive since its heyday in the late1990 s , first boston has slid down the league tables in a number of areas most notable is investment banking , where advisory fees declined 18 percent last year , compared with 2003 we 're not top tier in scale and size , said brian d finn , a first boston veteran who was recently named the firm s sole president while he said the firm was first tier in businesses it has focused on , such as leveraged finance and private equity , he conceded that there s a top five and a second five , and we 're second five among the bank s new initiatives is a return to proprietary trading mr gr bel said he had instructed his traders to take on more risk in this business , which he contrasted with mr mack s strategy john told them , 'you have to make money , but do n't take any risk , ' mr gr bel said which resulted in , they did n't take any risk and they did n't make any money mr mack declined to comment to push this cultural change , responsibility for the risks that these traders take will shift from separate equity or fixed income proprietary trading desks to a centralized location that way , traders can take bigger bets without worrying they will blow their desk s budget given the trading roots of mr gr bel and mr dougan , it is little surprise that credit suisse would gravitate in that direction among the businesses it plans to build up are fixedincome derivatives , foreignexchange derivatives and structured products , like interestrate swaps john mack was the right guy at the right time for csfb , said richard e thornburgh , a former chief financial officer of credit suisse , who is executive vice chairman of credit suisse first boston but now it needs a young management team , if the goal is to build it and make it profitable first boston faces numerous risks in carrying out its strategy the bank is moving into and reinforcing businesses that its competitors branched into years ago it is also expanding its trading products after some analysts say they believe the cycle has peaked and while it has a history of creating innovative financial instruments , its record of trading them is not as good csfb has n't been that great at the proprietary business , said mr ramsden of goldman sachs when they increase the risk profile , it has n't been good for shareholders the gap between csfb s financial performance and that of its competitors is huge in 2004 , csfb reported a pretax profit margin of 15 percent goldman sachs was 325 percent that discrepancy can be attributed to a weakened investment banking franchise and more notably , missing out on a runup in bond trading from 2001 to 2004 , average quarterly fixed income revenues on wall street increased 90 percent at csfb they declined 20 percent , according to mr ramsden mr thornburgh was recently put in charge of integrating the investment bank and its swiss parent the goal is to use credit suisse s private bank as both a market for the investment bank giving first boston a ready pool for its financial products and as a capital base over which to amortize its costs it would also allow first boston to take on more risk in trading as a first step , lawyers will merge the group s private bank and investment bank both are now separate legal entities in switzerland within 20 months , mr gr bel said , they would be fully integrated the whole industry would like to do this , but you have to have a good private bank , he said we have a trillion dollars in assets this would n't work if you only have 100 billion in assets in fact , credit suisse s archrival , ubs , has also pursued this concept and by most accounts , more successfully mr gr bel said the comparisons between credit suisse and ubs did not bother him he noted that credit suisse earned 75 percent as much last year as ubs 47 billion versus 68 billion despite being half its size they do n't think about us and we do n't think about them , he said , though the two peer at each other along zurich s main street , bahnhofstrasse still , mr gr bel says he is determined to make credit suisse a global bank , and on a much bigger scale than it is now that suggests that the bank will pursue big deals at some point in the future among recent speculation in europe s banking circles was a merger of credit suisse and deutsche bank mr gr bel played down the likelihood , saying he did not expect a spate of crossborder deals among european banks for the next five years , because of the patchwork of regulations when mr mack was forced out , some analysts speculated that first boston might be sold credit suisse has said it will spin off its swiss insurance arm , winterthur , which it views as a noncore asset first boston , however , seems central to credit suisse s ambitions , which makes a turnaround all the more critical at the meeting in orlando , mr dougan emphasized the huge opportunity he saw for the bank , he talked about the firm s new compensation units , called pip s for performance incentive plan under the plan , employees are awarded an increasing number of pip s as the investment bank meets its targets the units are restricted for five years , after which they translate to credit suisse stock , which should also rise if the bank succeeds about a third of the bank s managing directors have received the units , and mr dougan hopes to receive board approval to grant the plan to all managing directors over time the pip s , of course , only work if the bank s plan does and after so much turmoil , mr dougan is a realist about convincing all the skeptics i would n't expect every single person to sign on , mr dougan said i would expect about 95 percent to whatever the group is , i want them fully committed
boudu saved from drowning the criterion collection edition of boudu saved from drowning restores the light and life to jean renoir s 1932 classic , a film that has been known in this country only in gray , battered prints with soundtracks so crunchy that the dialogue was all but indecipherable boudu , the not very lovable tramp played by the great michel simon , still slurs his words as he tries to force them through his thick beard and alcoholic haze , but the poetry is back in them , as is the vivid documentary detail of renoir s film , set and largely filmed around the pont des arts , at the cultural and intellectual center of paris saved from an impulsive suicide attempt by an enlightened bourgeois bookseller , douard lestingois \( charles granval \) , whose shop and home overlook the bridge , boudu is the embodiment of the uncultured and ungovernable , a true force of nature whose uncontainable spirit is symbolized by renoir s use of his favorite image , moving water the bookseller congratulates himself on his act of heroic humanism \( and besides , it impresses the pretty maid with whom he is having an affair \) and invites boudu to join his household , in a gesture of social solidarity but the undomesticated , adamantly ungrateful boudu refuses to be redeemed and continues his life of impulsive outrage polishing his shoes on madame lestingois s satin sheets , and eventually bedding the mistress of the house just as her husband is receiving a civic medal for his act of courage no less than renoir s official masterpiece , the rules of the game \( 1939 \) , boudu seems an inexhaustible film , a nexus of political , philosophical and spiritual themes that reveals new meanings and fresh pleasures with each viewing the criterion disc comes with extras , both standard archive interviews with renoir and simon , critical commentary by eric rohmer and jean douchet and innovative , in the form of an interactive map of 1930 s paris that details renoir s carefully considered use of the city s geography this marvelous disc belongs in any serious collection 2995 , not rated weekend released in france on dec 29 , 1967 , jeanluc godard s weekend seems an eerily accurate anticipation of the social upheaval that was to rock france \( and a fair part of the western world \) just a few months later , in may 1968 this bitterly aggressive , profoundly misanthropic film imagines the weekly exodus from paris to the provinces \( as the city dwellers rush to the countryside , to renew relations with family and nature \) in apocalyptic terms , as a headlong rush from a failed , materialistic society into angry , violent anarchy boudu armed with a little red book and an ak47 the last commercial film made by mr godard before his radical tracts of the 1970 s , weekend \( it s french title , by the way , is weekend \) begins as a sour film noir , as a disaffected middleclass couple \( jean yanne and mireille darc \) head to the countryside with the hope of finally finishing off the wife s father , a miserly real estate magnate instead , they become embroiled in one of the most famous tracking shots in film history , as mr godard s camera moves the length of a paralyzing traffic jam , an image of a stalled society fueled by an anger that , for the moment , takes the form of honking horns but will not long be satisfied by symbolic gestures michael haneke , europe s current bashthebourgeois star director \( his new film , cach , will close the new york film festival this year \) seems as benign as captain kangaroo next to godard at this difficult juncture in his career the grisly violence of the final scenes , as the french revolution is evoked in the form of a bloodsplattered butcher , seems to anticipate the genuinely nihilistic horror films that italian directors like ruggero deodato \( cannibal holocaust \) and lucio fulci \( zombie \) would turn out during italy s own coming decade of social upheaval with the addition of commentary by the film scholar david sterritt , the new yorker video edition of weekend is identical to the disc released last year by the british company artificial eye , complete with its subtitles full of imponderable britishisms \( you oik of a peasant , one character says about another \) the disc shows the usual defaults of material transferred from the european pal standard to america s ntsc a softened image , blurry movement and a speededup running time , caused by the difference in frame rates between the systems 2995 not rated the defa scifi collection this box set from first run features brings together three sciencefiction epics produced by the east german studio defa \( for deutsche film ag \) films set in a near future that already feels like a distant past it s an interesting and entertaining lot , ranging from the relative sobriety of the 1960 polish coproduction the silent star , a lavishly budgeted adaptation of a stanislaw lem story , to the screaming camp of in the dust of the stars that film is a 1976 antiimperialist tract set on a distant planet where leopardprint wallpaper and silver lam boots are the latest fashion trends , and the local ruler is a sulky club kid who dyes his caesarcut blue and reclines voluptuously on lounge chairs the third film is the thoughtful eolomea \( 1972 \) it s easy to condescend to these works , and indeed , the silent star was duly ridiculed on mystery science theater 3000 in its cut and dubbed form as first spaceship on venus but there is meat here for both the student of socialist iconography and the idle

taken over by the nazis in the 1930 s defa , which likewise inherited berlin s huge babelsberg studio after the war , continued the ufa tradition of meticulous craftsmanship some effects shots suggest

great , with the widescreen images presented letterboxed rather than spread out for widescreen televisions , and there is a general softness throughout but given the rarity and fragility of this

washington , june 16 with his nomination to be ambassador to the united nations hanging in the balance , john r bolton made a hurried trip to capitol hill on thursday afternoon to meet with two of his chief democratic critics the senate majority leader , bill frist , delayed a vote on the bolton nomination until monday constructive discussions have continued over the course of yesterday and over the course of today , dr frist said , and that being the case , we have elected to have that vote monday evening but it was not clear whether the impasse , which stems from the bush administration s refusal to provide democrats with information they requested relating to mr bolton s tenure at the state department , would be resolved earlier in the day , mr bolton met with the two democratic critics , senator joseph r biden jr of delaware and senator christopher j dodd of connecticut , according to a statement from mr dodd s spokeswoman , stacie paxton senator dodd s message to mr bolton was plain and simple , the statement said mr bolton needs to convince vice president cheney to provide the information that he and senator biden have requested on numerous occasions last month , republicans fell four votes short of the 60 required to break a democratic filibuster over the nomination of mr bolton , whose aggressive management style and frequent clashes with intelligence officials have drawn criticism though there are several sticking points , a central issue is a request by mr bolton , while he was under secretary of state for arms control , to review the names of americans mentioned in communications intercepted by the national security agency and identified in highly classified intelligence reports democrats have drawn up a list of 36 names of concern and would like the white house to compare their list with the names mr bolton reviewed the white house has refused , but has responded to queries made by one republican , senator pat roberts of kansas , who asked for information about six officials with whom mr bolton had clashed mr roberts said wednesday that he had been told that none of those officials had been among the names reviewed by mr bolton but mr dodd , in a speech on the senate floor on thursday , said he was not satisfied if the administration can quickly crosscheck the names offered by mr roberts , mr dodd asked , why is it a problem to crosscheck the others \?

the bush administration has finally awakened to the grave dangers iraq s new government is courting by failing to reach out convincingly to credible representatives of the disaffected sunni arab minority washington s concern helped prompt secretary of state condoleezza rice s urgent mission to baghdad earlier this week unless her pleas for greater inclusiveness are heeded , the new government will not be able to establish the nationwide legitimacy it needs to draw significant numbers of sunnis away from the continuing insurgency the implications of that are clear as senior american military commanders now acknowledge , iraqi forces are n't militarily strong enough to prevail over the insurgency and will not be for a long time if baghdad continues to shun a serious political strategy to draw sunni support away from the insurgents , large numbers of american troops will be stuck fighting a prolonged and bloody counterinsurgency war in much of northern and western iraq such a sorry comedown from the high hopes of january s election would be tragic for iraq it would also be very bad for the united states the one country it would serve quite nicely is iran tehran is not eager to see a successful , broadly based shiite democracy , which might lead iran s discontented millions to wonder why they put up with a corrupt , repressive and economically benighted islamic dictatorship tehran is also understandably distrustful of iraq s sunni nationalists , having fought a long and costly war against saddam hussein s regime in the 1980 s and as the iranian authorities test the world s patience with their nuclear programs , they can only be relieved to see the bulk of american ground forces tied down indefinitely in counterinsurgency operations in iraq iran is already reinforcing its ties to iraq s new shiite leadership iran s foreign minister , kamal kharrazi , flew into baghdad two days after ms rice departed , and left yesterday brandishing a joint communiqu that blamed saddam hussein for that 1980 s war moreover , the iraqi party that has been most resistant to a more inclusive approach toward the sunnis is the supreme council for the islamic revolution in iraq , or sciri , the iraqi shiite party with the closest ties to the iranian ayatollahs sciri is just one of several parties in the current government coalition but none of the others , including the dawa shiite religious party and the two secular kurdish parties , have done much to resist sciri s exclusionary views and vetoes of prospective sunni nominees as a result , qualified and representative sunnis have been kept out of key positions in the new security forces , the cabinet and now the constitutiondrafting process shockingly , only two sunni arabs were chosen to sit on the 55member parliamentary panel named to draft iraq s new constitution it is understandable that iraq s shiites and kurds , who suffered so much under saddam hussein , are uncomfortable about letting people who served his predominantly sunni regime back into positions of power but unless lower and middleechelon baathists are allowed to serve , much of the sunni professional class will remain excluded from government and sympathetic to the insurgents millions of shiites and kurds risked their lives to vote in january because they wanted to help build a better , more democratic iraq the intervening months have been hugely disillusioning , with polls now showing a stunning 40percentagepoint drop in public confidence since january , as politicians have squabbled , insurgent attacks have soared and public services have further deteriorated the dream of a new iraq will ebb away unless leaders of the ruling shiite and kurdish coalition reach out boldly and bravely to their sunni neighbors
hartford , march 8 after negotiating the curves of a frustrating regular season , connecticut has finally found a stretch of straight , dependable highway as the ncaa tournament sits on the horizon the top is down , the pedal is to the metal and the huskies are hitting top speed when it counts , suggesting that they have a chance to cross the finish line first in women s college basketball yet again a 265 start tuesday night propelled thirdseeded uconn to the checkered flag of the big east conference tournament final with a 6751 victory over topseeded rutgers except for a period of engine lock in the first half , the huskies \( 237 \) steered steadily along , prevailing with familiar resolve and muscle on defense , sufficient patience and control against the fierce rutgers press , ceaseless hustle and tournamentready depth as uconn won the conference tournament for the first time since 2002 , guard ann strother scored 20 points , and forward barbara turner added 13 points and 6 rebounds center jessica moore contributed 12 points and 7 rebounds it was the second time that the huskies had defeated ninthranked rutgers in three meetings this season the scarlet knights , led by matee ajavon with 20 points , shot a frigid 18 for 57 \( 316 percent \) and were outrebounded , 4729 i think connecticut wanted it more , cvivian stringer , the rutgers coach , said they played harder it was evident with the rebounding we seemed a step slow it s good for connecticut this is the time you 've got to put it together with victories over rutgers \( 256 \) and notre dame both ranked in the top 10 on successive nights , uconn now appears to be gaining confidence that it might have a shot at a fourth consecutive national championship for starters , the huskies will get a scheduling favor uconn will open the ncaa tournament at gampel pavilion on its campus in storrs , where the first two rounds are scheduled for march 20 and 22 the tournament brackets will be announced sunday tuesday s game ended with words between uconn coach geno auriemma and rutgers point guard cappie pondexter , who scored 19 points late in the game , auriemma said afterward , he became concerned that a rutgers player was trashtalking to one of his players stringer accused auriemma of making a comment in the final minutes that was unbecoming a coach to any player at any time , anywhere auriemma told the associated press that the incident was a misunderstanding and that he had been speaking to a referee , not to any rutgers player robert e mulcahy , the rutgers athletic director , said he also hoped the incident was a misunderstanding asked what he had said , auriemma told reporters , none of your business later , he said he had not done anything inappropriate pondexter , whom auriemma coached previously on two junior national teams , seemed to play down the incident , saying of him , we 're very cool with each other before the game , auriemma said it was paramount that uconn avoid turnovers , which fueled the fierce rutgers press the huskies played with early composure and grabbed an 113 lead as turner kept pogosticking into the lane , driving past taller but slower rutgers defenders finally , auriemma hoped , turner was getting beyond a series of injuries and playing with a sense of desperation and reliability that would make her the natural successor to diana taurasi turner left the court several times tuesday , at least once with a knee injury , but kept returning she was named the most valuable player of the tournament for shooting 17 of 25 , scoring 47 points and posting 19 rebounds , 7 assists , 4 steals and 4 blocked shots in three games meanwhile , rutgers started slowly , its press stuck in neutral all told , the scarlet knights managed only 11 points off turnovers rutgers missed 14 of its first 16 shots , and 11 minutes into the game , the scarlet knights had two field goals and eight turnovers this was not the kind of start stringer had envisioned uconn was supposed to be coughing up the ball , not her team the huskies went on a 150 run , with strother delivering a 3point basket and three free throws turner scored again underneath , and the reserve forward willnett crockett made a beautiful pirouette on the baseline with 10 minutes 40 seconds left in the first half , the huskies were ahead by 265 , and rutgers was never closer than 9 points with 8 19 left , a turner free throw restored uconn s lead to double figures at 5141 , then strother hit a 3pointer from the corner and drove to the basket , giving the huskies a 5641 advantage soon after , the huskies pulled the parachute and coasted home based on the way we played this tournament if we continue to have that approach , teams are not going to be able to overlook us , turner said teams around the country understand that
if tazewell thompson ever takes home a tony , there s a good chance he 'll thank the nuns some introductions may be necessary mr thompson , 50 , is one of the nation s busiest freelance theater and opera directors , a frequent flier and selfprofessed workaholic whose productions have been seen at la scala in milan , the paris opera house and the teatro real in madrid , as well as at scores of regional theaters across the united states but his days as a hired gun are ending in january , mr thompson will take over as artistic director at the westport country playhouse , now in its 75th season and for the last five years under the leadership of joanne woodward and while he credits ms woodward , whom he calls his guardian angel , with bringing him to westport , mr thompson also thanks some other heavenly guidance the six years he spent in a dominican convent as a child he was a precocious child from a troubled home in the bronx his brother died at age 3 in a fire in their home , and his parents subsequently struggled with guilt and each other before mr thompson s grandmother sent him , at age 8 , to the sisters of st dominic in blauvelt , ny , near nyack it was not a happy time , at least at first for the first year and a half , i was morose and petulant and confused , mr thompson said recently , while drinking a glass of wine at lincoln center , where his staging of gilbert and sullivan s patience is set to open next month at the new york city opera but i realized later on that it was the best thing that could have happened to me it gave me a strong sense of discipline , and hard work and sticking with a job and knowing how good things feel when you complete a task , and to know how to answer to yourself and how to have empathy he will need all those talents , and maybe even a few others , in his new position mr thompson will take over at the playhouse at a crucial moment of both expanded possibilities and responsibilities in june , ms woodward unveiled an 18 million renovation of the theater , the culmination of a fiveyear fundraising drive that also created a million dollar endowment for the company the refurbished complex includes a 580seat theater , a new rehearsal hall and lobby space , and room for a restaurant to be overseen by paul newman , who will celebrate his 48th wedding anniversary with ms woodward shortly after mr thompson becomes artistic director at the same time , the company is undertaking an ambitious effort to expand its programming , adding three winter shows this year to the usual repertory of five summertime offerings , a move that even its board members admit is not a sure thing we think the audiences will be there , said elisabeth morten , the board s chairwoman mr thompson will direct the first show of the winter season , the immigrant , a musical by mark harelik , sarah knapp and steven m alper that will run in october and november he , too , is hoping that audiences will come but conceded that we do n't know adding to the pressure on mr thompson is the history of the playhouse the onetime artistic home of paul robeson and tallulah bankhead , among many other luminaries and the matter of succeeding ms woodward , no small feat considering her accomplishments as artistic director \( she will maintain the title of artistic director emeritus and remain on the board \) the establishment of the winter program is just the latest effort by ms woodward and her board to raise the profile of the playhouse , which has seen its budget more than double , to 4 million a year , during her tenure that figure is expected to grow to 6 million by 2009 , said chance farago , the company s director of communications , an increase that will doubtless require effective fundraising , one of mr thompson s many new duties , and healthy sales none of which seems to phase him being responsible to a board excites me , mr thompson said , without a hint of masochism in his voice it does n't limit me or make me feel challenged i like the idea of having budgetary restrictions and having someone to answer to ms woodward is optimistic about mr thompson s chances of success tazewell has wit and humor , she said and a real sense of the need for education , outreach and being part of the community ms woodward oversaw the 2002 broadway transfer of our town , starring mr newman , which was a wild financial success for the playhouse , and one that ms morten says she would love to emulate with future shows we do want to be nationally recognized , she said mr thompson who is moving to westport full time , leaving behind his manhattan apartment has an impressive track record , not only as director , but as a former actor and playwright his 2001 play , constant star , about the civil rights pioneer ida b wells , has been produced in more than a dozen theaters around the country he started in the theater as a child , performing in school plays in the convent , and worked as an actor throughout his 20 s he appeared on broadway twice in a bit part in peter nichols s the national health in 1974 , and in a prophetically titled comedy , checking out , in 1976 while the play lasted less than two weeks in new york , checking out was mr thompson s first brush with the westport playhouse the show had tried out there before booking on broadway \( that was not the playhouse s first transfer the company s very first production , streets of new york in 1931 , moved to broadway with dorothy gish in the lead \) since that contact with the playhouse , nearly 30 years ago , mr thompson has developed a reputation as a deft director of works by everyone from mozart to aaron copland in 1992 , he was hired as artistic director of syracuse stage , a nonprofit theater in central new york but it was not a good marriage , he said , so i annulled it after three years still , he said , i was able to see that this was something i wanted to do in the future in 2003 , he was hired to direct a playhouse production of the old settler , and later became friendly with ms woodward when the call came in to audition to lead the playhouse , he was not surprised but he was straightforward i met alone with joanne for some time , and i realized we had a lot of the same ideas and thoughts and tastes and plans for westport , mr thompson said but i wanted to make sure the board understood that they kept saying they wanted to take it in another direction , he explained , but i said , you have to be prepared that the audience s expectation of what they 've been having for the last several years might change in particular , he s not someone who is going to have a rolodex filled with stars and important people , mr thompson said , adding with laugh , my spouse is not a very famous actor \( mr thompson s partner , edmund bradley , is a restaurant consultant \) the board was sold we want to do a higher caliber of work than just summer stock , ms morten said and tazewell has the artistic vision and range to do just that mr thompson s plans are not too radical , yet in addition to the immigrant , he will direct another play , on the verge , by eric overmyer , in the spring his deal with the playhouse calls on him to direct three or four productions a season he said that he has already started to put together next summer s schedule , and that itwould include a production of clifford odets s awake and sing , and works by shakespeare and kurt weill asked what else he might want to do , he mentioned playwrights \( he likes tony kushner , john guare and jon robin baitz , among others \) , a chamber opera or two \( he is intrigued by gilbert and sullivan , and by astor piazzolla s opera , maria de buenos aires \) and an idea for a shortplay festival devoted to the environment he is , he said , excitedly nervous this feels so right in so many ways , he said i walked into the theater and suddenly felt that i had landed i'm old enough to run a theater and yet young enough to have the energy , the ambition , the drive , the will , to stand in front of people and inspire them the timing could not be better mr thompson , a stocky and cheerful man , said he was also looking forward to putting down roots in westport i have a wonderful career that takes me all over the world , he said but i do sometimes wake up in the middle of the night and wonder what city i am in \? am i in cleveland \? san francisco \? louisville \? milan \? he added that perhaps his early life in the convent had planted the desire deep inside , to be part of a family meanwhile , although he said he is not a practicing catholic , he is also remarkably frank about how important those formative years were growing up a catholic , one of the things that always intrigued me , that i found mysterious and fascinating , were guardian angels , he said and i believe in guardian angels , and guardian angels hover so right after i was chosen , joanne called and we had a very nice chat , and she said , 'do you mind if i hover \? ' he said and i just smiled , because i really see joanne as my guardian angel , hovering she s my st joanne season s end an affecting production of journey s end winds up the westport summer page 9
for lacy , effervescent moments , prosecco has its special place sparkling vouvray is certainly distinguished , and i recently enjoyed a superb cr mant d'alsace from barm sbuecher i'm always happy with a bottle of schramsberg , iron horse or roederer estate from california , less so with fizzy wine in a pink can like sofia mini blanc de blancs , though i do n't meet niebaumcoppola s target audience of young women for that product but when talking about sparkling wine , let s be honest there is champagne and there is everything else the others are good , but they 're not champagne which raises the question , is champagne always champagne \? no wine region in the world has done a better job than champagne of creating a mystique about itself whether bordeaux , burgundy , napa or tuscany , consumers are aware of an upper echelon of highquality wines , separated from a larger pool of mediocrity but champagne \? the mere mention of the word connotes joy and celebration most people need only to know that they are drinking champagne to be happy slightly more discerning types prefer one brand to another , possibly to be cynical about it because of the superior marketing of that particular brand the truth is that in champagne , as in every other wine region in the world , the wine made by producers who are passionate , committed and skilled can be transcendent as for the others , well , the best thing those bottles have going for them is the name champagne on their labels the trick , obviously , is separating the good stuff from the bad in quest of a few good bottles , the dining section s wine panel recently tasted 25 champagnes at the lowest price level , which nowadays can rise up to 30 contrary to the blithe image that a tasting like this may bring to mind , it was no easy task champagne , especially cheap champagne , can be harsh and acidic , and with 25 glasses before you , before long the tongue seems to swell and the inside of the mouth feels rasped by steel wool nonetheless , we were relieved and happy to find some champagnes that we could recommend enthusiastically why relieved \? because this category of champagne is no sure thing producers tend to baby their more expensive vintage champagnes those wines receive the best grapes , grown in the best sites , and in the cellar these bottles are attended to like favored children the basic champagnes , for the most part , receive far less consideration and consume fewer resources they are made from purchased grapes , or often enough from wines that have been purchased , already made the best wines are not likely to go into the blend that will result in the final nonvintage product , which can differ from year to year depending on which wines are available these are cashcow champagnes , intended to maintain a steady flow of income of course , some champagne houses are far more serious than others about their basic bottlings brands like bollinger , louis roederer and billecartsalmon are just a few of the bigger houses that make superb nonvintage champagnes , and many other labels do , too smaller houses like gosset , alfred gratien and bruno paillard also make excellent nonvintage champagnes but you are not likely to find any of these bottles for 30 and under , certainly not anymore that leaves an assortment of brand names some familiar , some not along with cooperative brands , which buy and blend the grapes for a number of growers , and a few small growers who produce champagnes from their own grapes alas , most in that last , highly interesting category do n't quite meet the 30 cutoff in the champagnes we tasted , i was first of all looking for a sense of liveliness and vivacity , the sort of taut energy that keeps you refreshed and coming back for more our favorite wines had that quality , and even a modicum of complexity , though intense minerality and the sort of baked bread and occasional berry flavors that you find in better bottles were hard to come by , as was the exquisite texture of a fine champagne i think you have to go to the next level for that , said evan spingarn , a wine salesman and an author of the ultimate wine lover s guide 2006 \( sterling publishing \) , who joined florence fabricant and me on the panel , along with our second guest , rebecca foster , the wine director at cookshop , a new restaurant in chelsea the tasting reminded ms foster of how difficult it is to grow grapes in champagne , which is the northernmost of any finewine region historically , growers struggle each year to ripen their grapes sufficiently in the region s chill , and , naturally , grapes from the best plots those designated premier cru and grand cru are generally reserved for the better and more expensive champagnes this tells you they have those designations for a reason , ms foster said yet , our no 2 wine , the louis de sacy brut , fullbodied and rich with a creamy texture and dry , toasty flavors , was labeled a grand cru , highly unusual for a 27 bottle \( this may have been shopper s luck the importer says the price is scheduled to rise soon \) the other wines we tasted , like our no 1 , the lanson black label , had no such designation nonetheless , i felt the lanson was the classiest of our tasting , lively with a juicy , lipsmacking acidity , and mineral and citrus flavors if it had a bare hint of sweetness , the overall sensation was dry because it was so well balanced by the acidity in some of the other bottles , a sense of sweetness was apparent , too whether this was intentional or not is hard to say some champagnes are meant to be a little sweet mo t chandon s white star is a rich , fullbodied champagne that is very popular in the united states it is specially formulated for the american market , which is thought to prefer some sweetness , and is labeled extra dry , which paradoxically is a step sweeter than brut we judged it too sweet for our tastes similarly a bottle of heidsieck company monopole extra dry was somewhat sweet and did n't make our list does this mean the two are bad champagnes \? no we simply preferred a drier style a much more serious issue in some of the champagnes that did n't make our list was the high level of sulfur that had been used as a preservative sulfur , in the form of sulfur dioxide , is almost universally used by winemakers at various stages of the production process but if too much is added , it mars the wine , resulting in an offputting aroma of burned matchsticks this made it impossible to enjoy several of our champagnes two of our top 10 were blanc de blancs , which means the wines were made entirely of chardonnay , rather than of the usual blend of chardonnay , pinot noir and pinot meunier these blanc de blancs are not necessarily lighter than conventional champagnes indeed , some can be full bodied but they often have a creamy texture , surprising complexity and , depending on where the grapes are from , precise mineral flavors the paul goerg , our no 3 wine , had a toasty quality that we all enjoyed and also a complex combination of floral and fruit flavors the other blanc de blancs , from pierre gimmonet fils , is a different kind of champagne it had great mineral flavors as well as apple and herbal aromas that seem more characteristic of conventional wine than of champagne that vinous quality is typical of a growerproducer champagne like this one it s not a champagne style that appeals to everybody , but it did to me and the rest of the panel over the last five years i have found nicolas feuillatte to be a particularly reliable champagne , a good value at almost every price level the brut was full bodied , with lingering flavors and , if not completely dry , was well balanced it was also the least expensive in the top 10 at 24 some wellknown names piperheidsieck , pol roger , perrierjou t and mumm s were among the champagnes we tasted that did not make our list it shows how dicey this category can be for 10 more , you can buy champagnes that are not only more reliable , but offer more dimensions of aroma , flavor and texture if you choose wisely , at 30 and under , you can certainly find satisfying bottles but too often , the result is champagne on the label , but less than you hope for in the bottle tasting report lively , energetic and under 30 lanson black label brut nv 28 rating three stars dry and refreshing , with snappy acidity and mineral and citrus flavors \( importer caravelle wine selections , avon , conn \) louis de sacy brut grand cru nv 27 rating three stars toasty and full bodied with a creamy texture and persistent flavors \( house of burgundy , port chester , ny \) paul goerg blanc de blancs nv 26 rating three stars yeasty , toasty aromas , with persistent , complex floral and fruit flavors \( usa wine imports , new york \) pierre gimmonet fils brut blanc de blancs nv 29 1 2 rating two and a half stars unusually complex and persistent flavors of apples , minerals and anise \( michael skurnik wines terry theise estate selection , syosset , ny \) nicolas feuillatte brut nv 24 1 2 rating two and a half stars bright and substantial , with citrus and floral flavors not quite bone dry \( pasternak wine imports , harrison , ny \) pannier brut s lection nv 25 1 2 rating two and a half stars rich and full bodied , lively and fresh , with yeasty , floral flavors \( martin scott wines , lake success , ny \) pommery brut royal nv 27 1 2 rating two and a half stars rich , with mineral aromas and nutlike flavors \( w j deutsch sons , white plains \) jacquart mosa que nv 27 rating two stars toasty caramel aromas with creamy , tropical flavors \( trivin imports , mount vernon , ny \) deutz brut classic nv 30 rating two stars straightforward , but lively and refreshing \( maison marques domaines , oakland , calif \) charles lafitte brut nv 27 rating two stars full bodied and fruity with intriguing fruit flavors slightly sweet \( vranken america , new york \) what the stars mean \( none \) pass it by passable good excellent extraordinary ratings reflect the panel s reaction to wines , which were tasted with names concealed the panelists this week are eric asimov florence fabricant evan spingarn , a wine salesman and an author of the ultimate wine lover s guide 2006 \( sterling publishing \) and rebecca foster , the wine director at cookshop the tasted wines represent a selection generally available in good retail shops and restaurants prices are those paid in liquor shops in the new york region tasting coordinator bernard kirsch nytimescom recent wine columns from the new york times are online nytimescom wine this week , members of the panel discuss their favorite champagnes under 30 wines of the times correction december 21 , 2005 , wednesday the wines of the times column last wednesday about champagne misstated its location in relation to other finewine regions it is the northernmost finewine region in france , not the world the mosel region in germany is more northerly
'the fantastic films of ray harryhausen' before the digital revolution , hollywood s most spectacular special effects were not created by programmers working in carefully coordinated tandem in production houses around the world but by one man , ray harryhausen , effectively playing by himself in his own sandbox mr harryhausen , still active at 84 , built his own scalemodel monsters a rampaging alien for 20 million miles to earth \( 1957 \) , a giant octopus with designs on the port of san francisco in it came from beneath the sea \( 1955 \) and painstakingly brought them to life through the technique of stopmotion animation moving his models in slight increments and photographing the results one frame at a time , mr harryhausen imparted presence , menace and vivid personalities to his creations but as polished as the results often were , mr harryhausen s work retained a disarmingly personal , handmade touch , a grain of humanity so often missing from the seamless , sophisticated computer generated images of today it s the homemade , sandbox quality that makes mr harryhausen s work still so appealing , even though technology has passed it by columbia pictures was mr harryhausen s home base through much of his career , and now columbia tristar home entertainment has released a second box set of his films , this time concentrating on his sciencefiction work rather than the fantasy films \( the three sinbad features , and others \) that made up the first batch as movies , the five features in the new box are uneven , ranging from the ragtag drivein features he worked on for columbia in the early 50 s \( the abovementioned 20 million miles and beneath the sea , plus the profoundly satisfying earth vs the flying saucers , with its flying discs crashing into the capitol \) , to the more elaborately and elegantly produced films he created after moving his operations to britain \( here , the 1961 mysterious island and the 1964 first men in the moon \) mr harryhausen and his longtime producer , charles h schneer , seemed to have an allergy to strong directors , and the only significant filmmaker they worked with during the years of their association , cy endfield \( a blacklisted american living in london \) , brought little of his personality to mysterious island but these films were n't meant to serve as much more than framing devices for mr harryhausen s creations first men in the moon is a laboriously unfunny victorian comedy , ostensibly based on a novel by hg wells , that ultimately kicks into gear when its cast descends beneath the lunar surface imagined by mr harryhausen as a giant honeycomb populated by thousands of droning , insectlike creatures and illuminated by green and orange disco lighting it has none of the photographic realism of similar sequences in star wars or the matrix , but it has something those films do n't a deliberate abstraction , a dreamlike quality that retains the unreality of the unreal what s the point of fantasy , mr harryhausen often seems to be asking , if it looks like a documentary \?

on a neglected stretch of inwood avenue near 170th street in the west bronx , weeds spring from cracks in the sidewalk and boardedup windows and curls of barbed wire appear as though in their natural habitats a shabby construction site occupies nearly an entire block tidy residential buildings and a few factories modestly claim the remaining space this motley , workingclass neighborhood is the home of emery thompson , a small but influential manufacturer of batch freezers ice creammaking equipment for small shops that has been quietly prospering in the borough for a century since world war ii , the company has occupied a former con ed power plant less than a mile from yankee stadium but nothing about the austere brick box that houses the company s headquarters hints at something as cheerful as ice cream the tiny sign at the street entrance simply announces , emery thompson machine supply company inside , the most visible implements are 40 sera lathes , mills and sheetmetal cutters , none of which suggest dessert the familyrun business has been in the bronx for a century , but at the end of this month , it will relocate to brooksville , fla , driven by rising oil costs and the desire of steve thompson , grandson of the founder , to live in a warmer climate i'm going to miss new york terribly , mr thompson said recently , glancing at an oversized map of florida laid flat on his office floor but that s one reason i chose brooksville , because it s one town over from tampa , and i 'll be able to catch the yankees in spring training during its long run as a new york manufacturer , emery thompson has maintained an unusually low profile according to malcolm stogo , author of ice cream and frozen desserts a commercial guide to production and marketing , 80 percent of the world s momandpop ice cream shops use emery thompson machinery but despite its preeminence in the world of frozen desserts , emery thompson is virtually unknown outside of the industry because their equipment is used in the back room , people do n't know who they are , said linda utterback , executive director of the national ice cream retailers association you do n't see the batch freezer when you walk into the ice cream store companies including h agendazs , ben jerry s , breyer s and carvel , all of which went on to become giants of the ice cream world , bought their first ice cream making equipment from emery thompson , and its machines have been shipped to every corner of the world in the shah of iran s palace , we had two , mr thompson said our machines are on nuclear submarines , in aircraft carriers i get letters from afghanistan saying in broken english that they want to get into the ice cream business mr thompson , 54 , cuts an unthreatening figure his unflinching smile , graying blond hair with a neat side part , crinkly blue eyes and ubiquitous golden retriever sidekick , sadie , render him as disarming as a milkman the company is named for his grandfather , who left his job at a 14th street soda fountain in 1903 to invent the modernday version of the handcrank rock salt ice cream maker his innovation increased the capacity of the device , so instead of making one quart in 20 minutes , it could make 10 gallons in six minutes though the machine has been updated over the years , today s emery thompson product is essentially the same as the original emery thompson machines have a life span of 40 to 45 years the average industrial batch freezer lasts about 12 today we 're using the same machine we bought 28 years ago , said philip seid , coowner of the chinatown ice cream factory in manhattan i remember a story about emery thompson supplying machines to the military they were dropped in parachutes from a plane , and when they hit the ground , they had to be able to work gabriella gershenson
a week after the metropolitan transportation authority opened up the bidding for the west side railyard , where the city wants to build a football stadium , a new bid has come in for the property one that seems custommade to stir the anger of deputy mayor daniel l doctoroff the bid was submitted yesterday by transgas , an energy company , which has offered to pay 700 million for the railyard and a platform over the tracks , which is 100 million more than the next highest bid , from cablevision but there is a catch transgas wants the mta s help in getting approval for the company s plans to build an electric power plant on the waterfront in williamsburg , brooklyn , along with a contract from the authority to buy power from the company for the next 20 years in an interview , adam victor , the president of transgas , did not deny that his offer , a threepage letter that went to the authority yesterday , is a form of revenge for more than two years , mr doctoroff the city s point man in winning the 2012 olympics and building the stadium has blocked the energy company s attempts to build a natural gas power plant at north 12th street , on the site of an active fuel oil depot just south of the bushwick inlet the city has proposed rezoning a 16mile stretch of the brooklyn waterfront , including the fuel depot and the adjacent neighborhood , for housing and open space in an example of how all landuse decisions seem to lead back to the city s bid for the 2012 olympics , the transgas site in brooklyn is currently designated for an olympic aquatic center as well as a site for beach volleyball mr victor said he was not opposed to the olympics and would gladly accommodate the aquatic center in brooklyn in an effort to quell community opposition to the power plant , mr victor has proposed building it underground and providing 50 million for affordable housing he also hired philip johnson alan ritchie architects to design the aboveground elements and carve out a spot in the new york skyline a rendering depicts a park , a spaceshiplike structure above a small administrative building and threesided pyramids above the intake vents the flues are wrapped in spiraling translucent glass that would light up at night it was mr johnson s last project before he died in january at 98 we turned the smokestacks and cooling tower into sculptural elements , mr ritchie said we wanted to create art mr victor said his bid for the railyard is an attempt to get the city s attention for his power plant , which would generate enough electricity to light a million homes , burn relatively cleanly and recycle its waste heat to make steam new york needs plants that can produce electricity locally , he said the bloomberg administration had suggested an alternative site , land owned by exxonmobil but that property , near the newtown creek , is highly contaminated with oil and is unavailable , mr victor said mr victor said his offer for the railyard had only three conditions , which could be met within a year the mta would have to agree to a 20year power contract and the state s siting board would have to grant a permit to transgas finally , he said , the public service commission would have to order con edison to buy steam from transgas at a price equal to its own cost of producing power none of this , the letter said , would require approval by the city or the federal government jennifer falk , a spokeswoman for the bloomberg administration , predicted that the stadium proposal would prevail in the end we remain confident that the mta process will produce the best possible proposal , and that the sports and convention center is the best one for the mta and for the city , as it will generate an enormous profit and help pay for vital city services like education and public safety , she said transportation authority officials could not be reached for comment yesterday , a legal holiday regarding the railyard , mr victor said that his bid did not preclude the construction of a stadium , although his company had not decided what it wanted to do there the bid from transgas is the latest offer for the development rights over the railyard since the bloomberg administration s plans to build a stadium that could be used by the jets and the olympics turned into a freeforall earlier this month cablevision , which owns madison square garden and has spent millions of dollars opposing the stadium , suddenly offered 600 million for the rights , 500 million more than the jets had put on the bargaining table as a result , the authority , which is facing fare hikes , service cuts and a multibilliondollar shortfall in its capital budget , decided to abandon its exclusive , yearlong negotiation with the jets and hold an auction the deadline for bids is march 21 the city will have to work with me if they want to build a stadium , said mr victor , who insisted he was making a bona fide offer
grand forks , nd embedded in the granite floor inside the main entrance to ralph engelstad arena , an enormous american indianhead logo spreads like a welcome mat in front of the largerthanlife statue of engelstad himself every night that the university of north dakota fighting sioux men s hockey team plays in its 104 million arena , thousands of fans walk across the likeness of the handsome sioux face in profile , with its four eagle feathers attached to the crown of the head it is humiliating to many of the school s indian students and faculty members who consider eagle feathers sacred we see the eagle as a messenger , said margaret scott , a sophomore nursing student from the winnebago tribe in nebraska it flies so close to the heavens , he carries the messages and prayers of the people to god in our culture , eagle feathers ca n't touch the ground it s like if you put a cross on a shot glass what they 're doing is sacrilegious as the ncaa begins enforcing a ban on indian imagery that it considers hostile or abusive , the north dakota arena and its logo pointedly illustrate the passions surrounding the issue , and the complexities , both political and financial , in resolving it the floor , walls and furniture of the hockey arena are plastered with as many as 3 , 000 of the sioux indian logos it is on each row of seats , on frosted glass doors and pillars , stitched into every two steps of the carpeting that rings the luxury box floor none of it can be cheaply or easily erased and the larger issue of the fighting sioux nickname , which has long been controversial here , has again polarized the campus , the town and the state one online student message board that favored the nickname was titled , everyone who opposes the sioux logo deserves to die of aids about 400 of the university s nearly 13 , 000 students are indian , making them the largest minority group on campus unless you 're here , you do n't know what it s like and how nasty it can get , said a psychology professor , doug mcdonald , who is sioux i 've had students in my office in tears because of the harassment we get last august , the national collegiate athletic association included north dakota among 18 schools whose use of indian symbolism it considered potentially hostile the ncaa said the imagery would be prohibited at championship events starting in february 2006 three universities florida state , utah and central michigan were later taken off the ncaa s list after local tribes voiced support for the use of their nicknames north dakota appealed the restrictions , and an ncaa review committee turned down the appeal in late september , though it allowed the university to play host to a scheduled men s hockey regional in march 2006 the university filed a second appeal earlier this month with the division ii council of presidents according to bob williams , an ncaa spokesman , the council will discuss the issue and forward a recommendation to the ncaa executive committee to consider at its january meeting in indianapolis north dakota originally adopted the nickname in the 1930 s in 1969 , a delegation from the standing rock sioux tribe including a grandson of sitting bull gave the university permission to formally call its teams the fighting sioux but antiindian sentiments simmered three years later , the fallout from a fraternity s obscene snow sculpture of a female indian led thomas clifford , the university president , to ban offensive indian symbols , although the hockey team was allowed to keep its cartoonish chicago blackhawkslike logo until 1993 engelstad , a north dakota goaltender from 1948 to 1950 who later became a las vegas casino owner , threw himself into the debate after donating 5 million to the university in 1987 the university inducted him into its hall of fame , though he had logged a mediocre 414 goals against average in 14 games later he donated 100 million for the new arena , which includes marble floors and more than 11 , 000 leather chairs it opened in 2001 , 13 months before engelstad died of cancer engelstad was a controversial figure who collected nazi memorabilia , gave two lavish birthday parties for adolf hitler in his casino in the late 1980 s , and was photographed in a nazi uniform engelstad later apologized for the parties and paid a 15 million fine to the nevada gaming control board , which had threatened to pull his casino license when it came to his beloved fighting sioux , however , engelstad refused to back down in 2000 , after the university s president , charles kupchella , formed a commission to study a name change and appeared to favor a switch , engelstad sent kupchella a letter threatening to halt arena construction , though terms of the lease bound engelstad to finish it but according to beverly clayburgh , a member of the state s board of higher education , another threat emerged about the same time men s hockey coach dean blais , an engelstad supporter who led the team to two ncaa titles , told her he would resign unless the issue was resolved to engelstad s satisfaction \( blais , now an assistant coach with the columbus blue jackets , said on friday through a team spokesman , i might have said that to somebody \) in response , the board hastily , and unanimously , voted to keep the nickname , taking the decision from the university and , ultimately , the state legislature the vote ignored both a statement from 21 indianrelated programs on campus and a 1999 student senate resolution favoring a nickname change the university is basing its appeal to the ncaa on a 2000 resolution by the spirit lake nation , which said it would not oppose the nickname and logo if the university established a zerotolerance policy toward racism and if it created a cultural awareness course but myra pearson , a tribal chairwoman of the spirit lake nation , said in a recent interview that the university had not kept those promises members of the spirit lake nation overwhelmingly opposed the nickname at a general assembly meeting in late september the tribal council has yet to consider a resolution north dakota s two other sioux tribes have passed resolutions demanding the school drop the nickname and the united tribes of north dakota , which includes all five indian tribes in the state , backed the ncaa s position in september kupchella said the university uses the logo and nickname with respect i do n't have a clue why anyone would take offense to something done respectfully and clearly meant as a honor , kupchella said in an interview in his office , where he displays a small framed sioux logo on a wall near his desk ok , you say you do n't like it but why \? there s never been an explanation that satisfied , i do n't think , any of the real proponents of keeping it even if the university changed the nickname in a decision that would rest with the board of higher education , the arena would not be obligated to remove the logos because the university does not manage it , an engelstad arena spokesman , chris semrau , said the university leased the building to an engelstad holding company until sept 30 , 2030 it would be cost prohibitive to remove or cover all the logos , semrau said the university would not be allowed to play host to any ncaa event , though , if it loses its appeal opponents of the nickname say that engelstad purposely filled the arena with logos in a show of defiance there are few such logos in the new betty engelstad sioux center for basketball and volleyball , which is named for engelstad s wife , or in the alerus center , the football stadium on the day the hockey arena opened , engelstad stood on the ice and declared that he hoped the logo would stand forever a statue of sitting bull on horseback guards the main entrance , and the words home of the fighting sioux in huge letters adorn the sides of the building in the concourses , spectators can buy siouxper dogs and various sioux logo souvenirs the university has cracked down on indianderived chants and inappropriate clothing in the arena , and mcdonald , the professor , said he appreciated the changes but that s not the point , he said as long as the name exists , it provides a breeding ground for this kind of problem if it s gone , we can move forward on other issues
albany , aug 23 gov george e pataki said tuesday he hoped that whoever taped telephone conversations of members of his inner circle discussing the awarding of patronage jobs during his first term will be brought to justice the governor , sounding grave , said the tape was apparently recorded illegally , and added that he thought the new york post might have broken the law this week by publishing transcripts of the calls , which it said appear to date from around 1996 the post and several experts on media law said it had a right to publish the material the transcripts include the governor s former appointments secretary , thomas doherty , complaining that state commissioners were slow to hire politically connected job seekers his wife , libby pataki , complaining that she had to keep up a demanding schedule that resulted in no publicity and one of the governor s supporters , alfonse m d'amato , then a united states senator , discussing patronage jobs in state government there were no shattering revelations in the published transcripts , but the tape certainly surfaced at an inopportune time for a politician just beginning to test the waters for a possible run for president the tape made a national stir , from links on the drudge report to a lengthy segment monday night on hardball on msnbc , which juxtaposed the pataki tape with earlier , more damaging political tapes monica lewinsky , marion barry and , of course , richard m nixon at a news conference in albany , governor pataki declined to comment on the substance of the transcripts i'm not going to comment on anything to do with illegal transcripts , he said there s a reason the law makes it illegal to record them , and there s a reason the law makes it illegal to publish them under new york state law , it is illegal to tape phone calls unless at least one party of the conversation consents mr pataki said that none of the people in these calls were aware of the taping , and that he did not believe the calls were taped by law enforcement officials , so they must have been illegally recorded but the post and some first amendment lawyers questioned the governor s assertion that publishing the transcripts was illegal the post said it received the tape in the mail from an anonymous sender kevin w goering , a media law expert at sheppard , mullin , richter hampton in new york , said , if the new york post lawfully obtained a copy of the transcript , or a copy of the tape itself , then under a long line of supreme court and lower court precedents , the newspaper would have a first amendment right to publish the contents
the recent outburst of popular religiosity in the united states is a most dramatic and unforeseen development in american life as europe grows more secular , america grows more devout george w bush is the most aggressively religious president americans have ever had american conservatives applaud his faithbased presidency , an office heretofore regarded as secular the religious right has become a potent force in national politics evangelicals now outnumber mainline protestants and crowd megachurches billy graham attracts supplicants by the thousand in sodom and gomorrah , a k a new york city the supreme court broods over the placement of the ten commandments evangelicals take over the air force academy , a government institution maintained by taxpayers' dollars the academy s former superintendent says it will be six years before religious tolerance is restored mel gibson s movie passion of the christ draws nearly 400 million at the domestic box office in the midst of this religious commotion , the name of the most influential american theologian of the 20th century rarely appears reinhold niebuhr it may be that most people of faith belong to the religious right , and niebuhr was on secular issues a determined liberal but left evangelicals as well as their conservative brethren hardly ever invoke his name jim wallis s bestselling god s politics , for example , is a liberal tract , but the author mentions niebuhr only twice , and only in passing niebuhr was born in missouri in 1892 , the son of a germanborn minister of the german evangelical synod of north america he was trained for the ministry at the synod s eden theological seminary and at the yale divinity school in the 1920 s he took a church in industrial detroit , the scene of bitter laborcapital conflict niebuhr s sympathies lay with the unions , and he joined norman thomas s socialist party meanwhile , new york s union theological seminary , impressed by the power of his preaching and his writing , recruited him in 1928 for its faculty there he remained for the rest of his life he died in 1971 why , in an age of religiosity , has niebuhr , the supreme american theologian of the 20th century , dropped out of 21stcentury religious discourse \? maybe issues have taken more urgent forms since niebuhr s death terrorism , torture , abortion , samesex marriage , genesis versus darwin , embryonic stemcell research but maybe niebuhr has fallen out of fashion because 9 11 has revived the myth of our national innocence lamentations about the end of innocence became favorite clich s at the time niebuhr was a critic of national innocence , which he regarded as a delusion after all , whites coming to these shores were reared in the calvinist doctrine of sinful humanity , and they killed red men , enslaved black men and later on imported yellow men for peon labor not much of a background for national innocence nations , as individuals , who are completely innocent in their own esteem , niebuhr wrote , are insufferable in their human contacts the selfrighteous delusion of innocence encouraged a kind of manichaeism dividing the world between good \( us \) and evil \( our critics \) niebuhr brilliantly applied the tragic insights of augustine and calvin to moral and political issues he poured out his thoughts in a stream of powerful books , articles and sermons his major theological work was his twovolume nature and destiny of man \( 1941 , 1943 \) the evolution of his political thought can be traced in three influential books moral man and immoral society \( 1932 \) the children of light and the children of darkness a vindication of democracy and a critique of its traditional defense \( 1944 \) the irony of american history \( 1952 \) in these and other works , niebuhr emphasized the mixed and ambivalent character of human nature creative impulses matched by destructive impulses , regard for others overruled by excessive selfregard , the will to power , the individual under constant temptation to play god to history this is what was known in the ancient vocabulary of christianity as the doctrine of original sin niebuhr summed up his political argument in a single powerful sentence man s capacity for justice makes democracy possible but man s inclination to injustice makes democracy necessary \( niebuhr , in the fashion of the day , used man not to exculpate women but as shorthand for human being \) the notion of sinful man was uncomfortable for my generation we had been brought up to believe in human innocence and even in human perfectibility this was less a liberal delusion than an expression of an allamerican dna andrew carnegie had articulated the national faith when , after acclaiming the rise of man from lower to higher forms , he declared nor is there any conceivable end to his march to perfection in 1939 , charles e merriam of the university of chicago , the dean of american political scientists , wrote in the new democracy and the new despotism there is a constant trend in human affairs toward the perfectibility of mankind this was plainly stated at the time of the french revolution and has been reasserted ever since that time , and with increasing plausibility human ignorance and unjust institutions remained the only obstacles to a more perfect world if proper education of individuals and proper reform of institutions did their job , such obstacles would be removed for the heart of man was ok the idea of original sin was a historical , indeed a hysterical , curiosity that should have evaporated with jonathan edwards s calvinism still , niebuhr s concept of original sin solved certain problems for my generation the 20th century was , as isaiah berlin said , the most terrible century in western history the belief in human perfectibility had not prepared us for hitler and stalin the death camps and the gulags proved that men were capable of infinite depravity the heart of man is obviously not ok niebuhr s analysis of human nature and history came as a vast illumination his argument had the double merit of accounting for hitler and stalin and for the necessity of standing up to them niebuhr himself had been a pacifist , but he was a realist and resigned from the antiwar socialist party in 1940 many of us understood original sin as a metaphor niebuhr s distinction between taking the bible seriously and taking it literally invited symbolic interpretation and made it easy for seculars to join the club morton white , the philosopher , spoke satirically of atheists for niebuhr \( luis bu uel , the spanish film director , was asked about his religious views i'm an atheist , he replied thank god \) about the concept of 'original sin , ' niebuhr wrote in 1960 , i now realize that i made a mistake in emphasizing it so much , though i still believe that it might be rescued from its primitive corruptions but it is a red rag to most moderns i find that even my realistic friends are inclined to be offended by it , though our interpretations of the human situation are identical the second world war left america the most powerful nation in the world , and the cold war created a new model of international tension niebuhr was never more involved in politics he helped found americans for democratic action , a liberal organization opposed to the two joes , stalin and mccarthy he was tireless \( until strokes slowed him up \) in cautioning americans not to succumb to the selfrighteous delusions of innocence and infallibility from the earliest days of its history to the present moment , niebuhr wrote in 1952 , there is a deep layer of messianic consciousness in the mind of america we never dreamed that we would have as much political power as we possess today nor for that matter did we anticipate that the most powerful nation on earth would suffer such an ironic refutation of its dreams of mastering history for messianism carrying on one man s theory of god s work threatened to abolish the unfathomable distance between the almighty and human sinners niebuhr would have rejoiced at mr dooley s definition of a fanatic according to the irish bartender created by finley peter dunne , a fanatic does what he thinks th' lord wud do if he only knew th' facts iv th' case there is no greater human presumption than to read the mind of the almighty , and no more dangerous individual than the one who has convinced himself that he is executing the almighty s will a democracy , niebuhr said , cannot of course engage in an explicit preventive war , and he lamented the inability to comprehend the depth of evil to which individuals and communities may sink , particularly when they try to play the role of god to history original sin , by tainting all human perceptions , is the enemy of absolutes mortal man s apprehension of truth is fitful , shadowy and imperfect he sees through the glass darkly against absolutism niebuhr insisted on the relativity of all human perspectives , as well as on the sinfulness of those who claimed divine sanction for their opinions he declared himself in broad agreement with the relativist position in the matter of freedom , as upon every other social and political right or principle in pointing to the dangers of what justice robert h jackson called compulsory godliness , niebuhr argued that religion is so frequently a source of confusion in political life , and so frequently dangerous to democracy , precisely because it introduces absolutes into the realm of relative values religion , he warned , could be a source of error as well as wisdom and light its role should be to inculcate , not a sense of infallibility , but a sense of humility indeed , the worst corruption is a corrupt religion one imagines a meeting between two men say , for example , the president of the united states and the last pope who have private lines to the almighty but discover fundamental disagreements over the message each receives thus bush is the fervent champion of the war against iraq john paul ii stoutly opposed the war bush is the fervent champion of capital punishment john paul ii stoutly opposed capital punishment how do these two absolutists reconcile contradictory and incompatible communications from the almighty \? the civil war , that savage , fraternal conflict , was the great national trauma , and lincoln was for reinhold niebuhr the model statesman of all american presidents , lincoln had the most acute religious insight though not enrolled in any denomination , he brooded over the infinite mystery of the almighty to claim knowledge of the divine will and purpose was for lincoln the unpardonable sin he summed up his religious sense in his second inaugural , delivered in the fifth year of the civil war both warring halves of the union , he said , read the same bible and prayed to the same god each invoked god s aid against the other let us judge not that we be not judged let us fight on with firmness in the right , as god gives us to see the right but let us never forget , lincoln reminded the nation in memorable words , the almighty has his own purposes thurlow weed , the cynical and highly intelligent boss of new york , sent lincoln congratulations on the inaugural address i believe it is not immediately popular , lincoln replied men are not flattered by being shown that there has been a difference of purpose between the almighty and them to deny it , however , in this case , is to deny that there is a god governing the world it is a truth which i thought needed to be told and as whatever of humiliation there is in it , falls directly on myself , i thought others might afford for me to tell it the combination of moral resoluteness about the immediate issues , niebuhr commented on lincoln s second inaugural , with a religious awareness of another dimension of meaning and judgment must be regarded as almost a perfect model of the difficult but not impossible task of remaining loyal and responsible toward the moral treasures of a free society on the one hand while yet having some religious vantage point over the struggle like all godfearing men , americans are never safe against the temptation of claiming god too simply as the sanctifier of whatever we most fervently desire this is vanity to be effective in the world , we need a sense of modesty about the virtue , wisdom and power available to us and a sense of contrition about the common human frailties and foibles which lie at the foundation of both the enemy s demonry and our vanities none of the insights of religious faith contradict our purpose and duty of preserving our civilization they are , in fact , prerequisites for saving it the last lines of the irony of american history , written in 1952 , resound more than a halfcentury later if we should perish , the ruthlessness of the foe would be only the secondary cause of the disaster the primary cause would be that the strength of a giant nation was directed by eyes too blind to see all the hazards of the struggle and the blindness would be induced not by some accident of nature or history but by hatred and

viduitsy , belarus the winter rye is already sprouting green in the undulating fields of the state cooperative farm here the summer s crop rye , barley and rapeseed amounted to 1 , 400 tons best of all , the farm s director , vladimir i pryzhenkov , said , none of it tested radioactive that is progress the farm s 4 , 000 acres are nestled among some of the most contaminated spots on earth , the poisoned legacy of the worst nuclear accident in history the explosion at chernobyl reactor no 4 on april 26 , 1986 nearly a quarter of belarus , including some of its prime farmland , remains radioactive to some degree mr pryzhenkov s farm represents part of the government s efforts to put the contaminated lands back to good use the farm , no longer known as the karl marx collective but still stateowned , reopened two years ago with the millions of dollars' worth of harvesters , tractors and other equipment provided by president aleksandr g lukashenko s government a year before that the checkpoints that once restricted access to this region , 150 miles from chernobyl , disappeared families began returning some had never left all needed jobs mr pryzhenkov , assigned here from another coop in what he called a promotion , has also begun breeding horses and cattle for beef , though not for milk milk produced here would be far too dangerous for human consumption this was all falling apart , he said as he drove a battered uaz jeep over the farm s muddy , rutted roads there was nothing for the people to do here mr lukashenko , a former collective farm boss himself , declared last year that it was time to revive the contaminated regions , outlining a vision of new homes and villages , of new industry , of rejuvenated farms land should work for the country , he said his authoritarian decrees , on this and other topics , have prompted shock , fear and even ridicule , but a scientific study released in september by seven united nations agencies and the world bank more or less agreed with him it concluded that chernobyl s lasting effects on health and the environment had not proved as dire as first predicted it recommended that the authorities in russia , ukraine and belarus take steps to reverse psychological trauma caused by chernobyl , encouraging investment and redevelopment lands where agriculture was banned or severely restricted can be safe for growing crops again , the report said , using techniques to minimize the absorption of radioactive particles into produce it is desirable to identify sustainable ways to make use of the most affected areas that reflect the radiation hazard but also revive the economic potential for the benefit of the community , the report said its conclusions have stirred controversy greenpeace denounced it as a whitewash even a member of mr lukashenko s government , valery l gurachevsky , the scientific director of belarus s committee on chernobyl , called parts of the report too optimistic but here in the countryside , where entire villages were left to rot in an invisible scourge , the report s underlying principle is a welcome one gennadi v kruzhayev , now 38 , had just begun working on the karl marx collective when the accident occurred he has since drifted from job to job he drove a taxi he pumped gas one day recently he was atop a tractor , plowing the black earth for next spring s sowing the main thing , he said , is to have jobs the chernobyl disaster spewed radioactive material over all of europe , but naturally the closest areas russia , ukraine and belarus , then soviet republics suffered the worst the soviet authorities declared an emergency exclusion zone within 19 miles of the reactor , a circle straddling the border between ukraine and belarus the zone remains closed , except to the workers overseeing the reactor s decontamination , a few hardluck pensioners who have drifted back and , increasingly , curious tourists on macabre day trips the contamination particularly from cesium137 as well as the more deadly strontium90 and plutonium was hardly confined to that circle , though areas as radioactive as parts of the exclusion zone still appear on maps of belarus as irregular splashes across the eastern part of the country those areas remain off limits , at least in theory around them are areas with lower levels , creating a patchwork of go and nogo zones that by all appearances are routinely ignored more than 130 , 000 belarussians were relocated in the years after chernobyl , but mostly to areas with lower levels of contamination , often only a few miles away about 13 million people , or 14 percent of the population , live in contaminated areas , though officials say that with certain precautions , they face little health risk in those areas farming never stopped entirely , though the economy collapsed instead , the state s farms adopted measures to minimize contamination of crops , including the use of certain fertilizers some crops absorb less radiation anyway those that absorb more are grown only for fodder since mr lukashenko came to power in 1994 , the government has tried to expand agriculture in the region , removing restrictions on less contaminated areas gennadi v antsipov , who oversees reclamation for the country s chernobyl committee , said the process was complicated and , despite mr lukashenko s urgings , deliberate of 1 , 000 square miles of contaminated land , only 54 square miles has so far been returned to active agricultural use , including viduitsy a periodic survey completed last year found that still more land could be reclaimed why should we rush this issue \? mr antsipov said in the capital , minsk it is like sending someone to the moon just to prove we can colonize it mr lukashenko s government , despite its diplomatic isolation , has worked with international agencies , including the united nations development fund , to improve crop yields and limit contamination of food products we are trying to provide people a fishing rod , not a fish as we did before , valery y shevchuk , the chernobyl committee s deputy chairman , said radioactive materials , especially cesium137 , with a halflife of 30 years , will decay over time , but life in the contaminated parts of belarus will not soon be normal in viduitsy , mr pryzhenkov pointed out the fields that remained too hot to grow even animal fodder they are fairly obvious because they are overgrown , though he sometimes consults a map with precautions , he and others say , the food grown here is safe the government claims to strictly check all produce without a certificate , farmers cannot sell what they grow other risks lurk in the forests and fields small kitchen gardens , used as in soviet times for subsistence , are mostly unregulated mushrooms and berries , as well as wild game , absorb high levels of radiation fish from local lakes and rivers are toxic keeping bees for honey is not considered a good idea government advisories warn people not to eat those delicacies vera a brausova , 73 , who lives in a village called krasny kurgan , does anyway asked about health concerns , she explained that she had lived through world war ii , the chernobyl accident and a fire that burned down the first house she was evacuated to what health are you talking about \? she said
to the editor ruth wedgwood \( oped , dec 5 \) argues that united nations reform would benefit from a jolt to the organization s monopoly under the guise of competitive multilateralism in fact , chapter viii of the united nations charter provides for regional arrangements or agencies to deal with matters relating to the maintenance of international peace and security organizations like the european union and the african union do already handle many political , security , economic and human rights issues that affect their members in an increasingly complex world , the united nations welcomes this form of burdensharing but none of these agencies can seriously compete with the united nations as a source of universal legitimacy , or even as an organizer and coordinator of global peacekeeping , peace building and humanitarian relief nato , for instance , is now playing a valuable role in afghanistan , but neither it nor the african union even less the fledgling community of democracies could contemplate taking over the eight peacekeeping missions that the united nations currently has deployed in africa certainly the united states should support other multilateral organizations but it must also persevere in its efforts to build consensus within the united nations to enact the ambitious reform agenda proposed by the secretary general and endorsed by all world leaders at last september s summit meeting shashi tharoor un under secretary general for communications and public information new york , dec 6 , 2005
years after enron made financial reports look less reliable than a preschooler s math , public companies are still having trouble getting their numbers right the number of restatements by publicly held companies surged to a high in 2004 , according to results of a study of regulatory filings by the huron consulting group the firm , which is expected to release its findings today , found that 253 companies restated their annual audited financial reports last year , a 23 percent increase from 206 in 2003 another 161 companies restated quarterly financial statements , as against 117 in 2003 that is the highest number of restatements of any of the last five years and is something of a surprise , said joseph j floyd , managing director and national practice leader of huron s disputes and investigations practice he added , one would hope that what we 're experiencing is a period of time that is at the top of the curve the study also found that the number of companies restating results from more than one year increased about 40 percent 101 of the companies restating annual results were revising financial reports for three years , mr floyd said of the problems being identified in 2004 , a large number of those are multiyear problems , he said he added that more than 60 companies that filed restatements last year reported errors in filings in previous years , too there are various possible explanations for the overall increase in restatements , none of them entirely satisfactory most likely a combination of factors led corporate executives to restate results last year some of the surge was a result of companies' efforts to comply with section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act , the corporate governance legislation passed in the wake of revelations of corporate fraud in 2002 , mr floyd said that provision requires that companies have their outside auditors review their internal controls the processes the companies use to record financial transactions and report their results the 404 effort that was under way was an unprecedented period of scrutiny for accounting controls , mr floyd said nearly a third of the restatements involved improper reporting of revenue or faulty accounting for stock options or other equity instruments , according to huron but section 404 would not lead directly to a restatement , said john t bostelman , a partner at the law firm of sullivan cromwell and author of a reference work on the law a company could receive a clean audit even if its internal controls were found wanting , he said i actually would be surprised if restatements were being driven by the internal control requirements some of the restatements may simply reflect the fact that auditors are much more conservative and more apt to instruct a client to restate earnings after finding an error that several years ago might have been overlooked or ignored the criminal prosecution of enron s auditor , arthur andersen , put accounting firms on notice that times had changed auditors in the wake of the demise of andersen are less likely to turn the other cheek in the face of financial fraud , said paul geller , a partner at lerach coughlin stoia geller rudman robbins , a law firm specializing in securities litigation that is based in san diego the number of restatements does not necessarily mean that the level of shareholder litigation activity will increase because not all restatements are evidence of fraud , said joseph grundfest , a professor at stanford law school there s a popular perception that a restatement inevitably leads to litigation , he said that statement is wrong restatements can happen for entirely nonfraudulent reasons , and restatements do not always lead to significant stock price declines nonetheless , the overall number of shareholder lawsuits filed in 2004 rose to 212 , from 181 the preceding year , according to the securities class action clearinghouse at stanford law school it is not clear how many of those lawsuits followed restatements although every restatement may not be evidence of fraud , the fact remains that there s a strong correlation between the issuing of financial restatements and the filing of securities class actions on behalf of investors , mr geller said he said his firm was busy in 2004 and added , this report does n't give any indication that things are going to slow down
alerce , chile the majestic tree that gives this town its name is one of chile s principal national symbols streets , schools , suburban housing developments , hotels , gas stations , taxi fleets and even a record company and a brand of cellphone all invoke and honor the towering and sturdy sequoia of south america , as the alerce is sometimes called but here in alerce , as in many other parts of southern chile , there are scarcely any alerce trees to be found these days predatory cutting and burning in defiance of laws meant to protect the species have reduced its range and numbers by half and created a lucrative black market in which alerce timber can fetch as much as 5 , 000 per cubic yard , if successfully spirited abroad the corruption is tremendous , involving very important people , said adriana hoffman , a former environmental protection agency director there is always plenty of talk about saving the alerce , but nothing gets done and as a result , we are losing part of our patrimony what is going on is truly scandalous despite its resemblance to the north american redwood , the alerce \( pronounced ahlersay \) is actually a relative of the cypress , with a tough , waterresistant reddishbrown wood that makes it much soughtafter for use in building construction and furniture making slowgrowing , largely because it favors soils poor in nutrients that other trees shun , it nonetheless grows to a height of 165 feet or more and a width of 15 feet , and some trees in protected areas are more than 3 , 600 years old since 1975 , the export of alerce timber from chile for commercial purposes has been banned under the convention on international trade in endangered species to further protect the species , chile in 1976 also approved laws that declared the alerce a national monument and prohibited the cutting down of any live trees but those regulations contained a loophole that loggers were quick to exploit since it is legal to harvest dead trees killed off by fire , lightning or disease , traffickers have been clandestinely helping the process along , environmental advocates say , in hopes of reaping big windfalls most often , loggers simply strip trees of their bark or set forest fires to scorch them and make them eligible for the death certificates that are required before they can be cut down and trucked to sawmills but the traffickers have also been known to strangle alerces with metal rings placed tightly around the trunk on a recent cold and drizzly saturday morning , jos dar o c rcamo , 68 , and his son and grandson were scavenging for the remnants of trunks in what had once been a grove of alerce trees here their plan was to recover as many stumps as they could with their axe and power saw and then sell the wood , either to neighbors for fuel or to local artisans who prize the alerce as the raw material for carved souvenirs or musical instruments when i was a young man , it seemed that there were still alerce forests everywhere , said mr c rcamo , a former woodsman now my grandson has only this , and god only knows what will be left for his grandson government officials maintain that environmental groups here and abroad are exaggerating the threat they argue that alerce stocks remain plentiful and that the official policy is working better than the alternatives suggested by critics the alerce is not going to be wiped out this year or next , or in the next thousand years , carlos weber , director of the national forestry corporation , the government agency that oversees all aspects of chile s forest management , said in an interview in santiago we 're not talking about 50 or 100 trees left , we 're talking about hundreds of thousands of acres , far above what the market demands each year in an effort to safeguard the alerce , chile has set up a network of national parks and other protected areas but the government has crippled the environmental crimes division of the national police , and environmental advocates say they are worried at other signs of a lack of resources and political will to guarantee that the law is obeyed it s an absurd responsibility and raises the question of whether the government is serious about enforcing environmental laws in southern chile , said aaron sanger , the representative in chile of forest ethics , an american environmental group the government has one ranger for every 900 , 000 acres in that region , so it is kind of hard for that ranger to do a good job of detecting illegal logging in these remote places environmental groups charge that the illegal traffic in alerce wood is controlled by a mafia that has connections to powerful politicians last year , a judge near here received death threats after she began an investigation into charges that a federal senator had improperly pressured mr weber to issue logging certificates to favored constituents more recently , the mayor of fresia , west of here , nelson schwerter , was arrested and accused of being a middleman in an alercesmuggling scheme he has accused judicial authorities of a political vendetta , but five woodcutters have identified the mayor as the person to whom they sold illegally logged alerce much of the alerce shipped abroad has been tracked to places like britain and japan the alerce is mixed with other woods that are not on the protected list , and the customs people are none the wiser , said dr hoffman , now the director of defenders of the chilean forest , a leading environmental group there is little control and even less knowledge yet in spite of the high price that alerce commands on the black market , commercial loggers have shown little interest in replanting the tree , for obvious economic reasons pine and eucalyptus grow fast enough that they are ready for cutting in as little as 20 years , while the alerce requires 1 , 000 years or more
waterloo by karen olsson 307 pp farrar , straus giroux 24 all politics is local , as tip o'neill once said in this view the classic view power flows from an intense form of connectedness , from iou s and whoyouknows , from potholes filled and streetlights fixed and babies kissed at parades this was surely true for arthur \( goddamn \) fenstemaker , perhaps the only man ever elected governor of a novel the novel is the gay place by billy lee brammer rarely read these days , brammer s 1961 epic of the hustings ranks with robert penn warren s all the king s men as one of the few ambitious works of fiction ever to embrace that most american of topics democracy the country is barbarously large and final , runs the great first line of the gay place it is too much country boondock country alternately drab and dazzling , spectral and remote it is so wrongfully muddled and various that it is difficult to conceive of it all of a piece brammer s prose is itself a form of government , with modifiers paired and subtly clashing , like so many congressmen jostling to get their language in a bill if democracy is local if each voter is preoccupied by his or her own personal boondock , pet issue or pet problem then crowds are bound together only by the commanding vanity of the berleader brammer , an aide to lyndon johnson , envisioned fenstemaker as the berest of leaders , a hurricane of neediness , duplicity and vision like the selfabsorbed love child of lbj and , well , a selfabsorbed lbj karen olsson s first novel , waterloo , a melancholy comedy of texas politics , opens with a quick , sardonic quotation from the gay place but in waterloo , democracy has shifted in its very dna there s no space now for leadership , ber or otherwise power still flows , but the connections are no more the focus on small problems the pothole and the streetlight has been supplanted by a few huge themes , endlessly repeated , beamed out on the airwaves to the suburbs christian values , family values , christian families there s nothing else to talk about voters , numbed by repetition , begin to disengage , leaving the special interests free to carve up the public bird in waterloo , all politics is local anesthesia luckily for us , we have our choice of anesthesias consider , for example , the journalist nick lasseter , exrocker and blossoming alcoholic nick works for an alternative weekly in the city of waterloo \( read austin , tex , where olsson makes her home \) assigned to write an expos of an ominous megadevelopment project called waterloo village , he begins to probe a candidate for governor named mark hardaway \( imagine a ken doll after a searing religious experience \) and an embattled state assemblywoman , beverly flintic olsson , a former editor of the texas observer , is currently a writer at large for texas monthly magazine she knows the world of statehouse journalism cold and writes about nick s work with great wit and assurance as the novel ramifies , we meet nick s friends and fellow reporters , the people he drinks with , the people he sleeps with most are , like nick , youngish but no longer young and firmly in the grip of a nostalgia for the dive bars and rock clubs that flourished before the yuppies and rightwingers bought the town on the other side of the psychic aisle from nick and his louche friends are the working politicians , almost all of them republicans one surprise in waterloo is the streak of sympathy running through olsson s satire of the system mark hardaway , the statewide candidate , plainly a dim bulb , is just bright enough to realize his own dimness , though only dimly , which leaves him constantly anxious that he has n't quite followed what his aides are saying carson yates , hardaway s chief handler , is disciplined and ruthless , his one weakness being an addiction to root beer but olsson s main achievement here is beverly flintic , a conservative state assemblywoman from the big numb suburbs beverly strives to be the model public servant , but the model seems to date from student government she works late and on weekends , applying a prim , goshdarnit sort of wisdom to a very messy world her husband has been fired from a software startup and now has a mindless job with a friend s inventory company , her 11yearold son is turning punk beverly fumbles into an affair and none of it computes olsson , to her credit , writes the interlude of selfdestructive sex not as a cry for help but as a cry for sex for outlet and release , antianesthesia at all costs oddly enough , beverly s strength as a character is a problem for the last leg of the novel when olsson shifts away to mind her other subplots , no other waterloosian can hold our interest so completely in structure , the book is a little like a city subplots are expressways weaving through its present , broken only by strategic jumps in time , back to 1952 , 1954 , 1965 in the end , these plots and character groupings do n't come together in any grand crescendo rather , they coalesce slowly around a particular street corner or a building or a bar a man runs for office in 1952 , betraying one friend to serve another in the course of this betrayal , a library is built that later , as a ruin , stands squarely in the path of waterloo village and its dubious urban renewal the living city is the sum of these local nodes of meaning and memory , olsson s fine novel seems to say , and waterloo will lose them to its large and final peril mark costello s most recent novel is big if
press secretaries can be surprisingly hard to get on the phone but perhaps none have been harder to reach recently than david chai , a member of the new york city council s press office who handles reporters' inquiries about contracts and ethics , among other matters on different days last week , we attempted to contact mr chai at the press office , but no one seemed to know where he was or when he would be back , though a check with the department of citywide administrative services revealed that mr chai remained an active employee of the council a woman who answered his phone on wednesday confirmed that mr chai still had a desk in the press office but was working from home that day asked if he would be in the next day , the woman said , i'm not sure we called the same number on thursday , and a man told us mr chai was not in that day again we asked if mr chai planned on being at work the following day i'm not sure , that man replied i guess you could try him at home , if you have the number we asked if he had a phone number at which mr chai could be reached um , no , he said undeterred , campaign journal tried again on friday a woman told us mr chai was not in asked if he would be in on monday , she replied , the best way to get a hold of him would be to call him on his cellphone so we did mr chai promptly returned the call , explaining that he had given notice in june and had been transitioning out of his council job after his wife gave birth recently the first and best advice that i got when i had a baby was , be where your family is so you can get free babysitting , mr chai said in his case , that meant moving to san francisco , where he has been residing the past several days and where his family lives he 'll soon start working with the city s mayor , gavin newsom , in mr newsom s communications office stephen sigmund , a spokesman for the council , said that mr chai would be off the council s payroll by the end of july nicholas confessore
atlantic city joe russo , lurking behind thick , dark , 90 ship glasses , jerked and shook as he pummeled his huge drum set a bit across the massive stage , mark benevento tortured his keyboard just enough to coax out a wail that could loosely be called creative feedback but do n't worry , jimi hendrix , you can rest easy the crowd on the floor during opening night of house of blues at the showboat casino here on june 24 swayed some , jumped a little and generally approved there were a lot of backward baseball caps and quite a few tattoos each patron had to empty pockets and be passed over by an electronic wand to enter the place , though many of them clutched plastic casino drink cups as they did the beneventorusso duo were opening for government mule , a bluesbased rock band in the mold of creedence and the allmans at the back of the floor , roadies sold government mule cd s d j hoodoo anybody \?

casinos are recognizing that there is more of a demand from younger adults than they thought , and they are going after that , said michael pollock , who edits gaming industry observer , a trade magazine i 'd say it will vary , but the core of it is 30to 45yearolds casinos are learning that there are a number of adults in that group who have disposable income and are willing to spend it on games of chance i remember robin williams telling jokes in the 1980 s about casino patrons suffering from terminal polyester not anymore as recently as five years ago , entertainment in atlantic city was a lot different there were no rappers or anything that could remotely be called modern rock the big act of the summer of 2001 was debbie reynolds , who was at the atlantic city hilton for five days in july and august she was followed by bobby rydell , frankie avalon and fabian in their golden boys of the 1950 s show this week five years ago , the casino showrooms featured carrot top , dame edna , a production of cats and frank sinatra jr that came on the heels of a spring that offered this array of headliners steve lawrence and eydie gorme , bobby vinton , neil sedaka , rich little , jackie mason and tony danza none of whom is on the roster anywhere in atlantic city this year back then , the trump marina had started to book babyboom acts like steppenwolf , jethro tull and earth , wind fire that was about as cutting edge as it got in atlantic city we tried to do something different in about the late 1990 s at the marina , said steve gietka , vice president for entertainment at trump entertainment , which controls the three trump properties in atlantic city at trump , we have a core gambling base , but we felt we needed to grow some gamblers mr gietka called atlantic city a metoo town , a place where when some casino has a kind of act , game , restaurant or shop , the others soon follow yet mr pollock said it took a long while for casinos to go toward younger casino entertainment after the trump marina went with mostly classic rock it was not perceived that younger people were interested in atlantic city , or even casinos in general , or that they had much disposable income , mr pollock said everyone pretty much left that crowd to trump marina and , to an extent , harrah s next door then came the borgata where the trump casinos were just others of the old boys at the shore , the borgata was big and splashy and had the news media s ear entertainment at borgata was n't so young , but it was young enough and it was n't johnny mathis meat loaf , steely dan and crosby , stills and nash , for example other operators were content to let trump marina have the young acts until borgata opened , said larry mullin , borgata s chief operating officer i 'll give trump credit he did it before us but we wanted the big splash in just about everything , a way to attract the people who had rejected the market part of that was getting younger rock acts we were saying , 'you can come here and be a senior citizen , but do n't come to the borgata to act like a senior citizen , ' borgata has contracted with electric factory concerts , a major rock promoter going back to the 1960 s , to do a lot of its booking mr gietka at trump entertainment also uses electric factory some showboat s agreement with house of blues , a chain of restaurant clubs , lets it choose its own acts the house of blues renovated showboat s showroom , putting a seatless floor on the original level and building a semicircle of theater seats in a balcony above the effect on the ground floor is a more antiseptic version of the old rock halls like the electric factory in philadelphia and the fillmores east and west in new york and in san francisco there are funky new orleansbluesinspired paintings on the walls and traditional bellyup bars around the floor , but nowhere to sit at the government mule show , there were small , onebartender pavilions selling budweiser in plastic cups the entry was clearly more lowlevel rock concert than tony bennett showroom everyone went through one of three lines bordered inelegantly by folding tables each person emptied his or her pockets and was met by a security person who did an airportlike patdown and metaldetecting wand sweep while this might have caused problems with the older casino crowd , the 25through50 s who seemed to dominate at the house of blues opening night were unfazed by a process that they have gone through at concerts for years the definition of what is considered 'older' is changing year by year , mr pollock said you could say crosby , stills and nash is a younger act , but by whose standards these days \? my friends and i , and we 're not young at all , were certainly looking forward to lynyrd skynyrd , but does that mean it is a younger act \? even at the house of blues , though , it will not be all uptodate music devo , the commodores , al green and bruce hornsby , who will be there this summer , all appeal to an audience that grew up at least in the 1970 s still , devo fans at first glance do n't quite seem like slotmachine pullers the market in atlantic city is changing , said jenny holaday , the vice president for marketing at harrah s , showboat and bally s the year after the borgata opened , our fastestgrowing age group was 21 to 49 that tells marketers like me that we were getting people who never came to atlantic city before you have to find a way to keep them now ms holaday said summer in atlantic city is different from the rest ofthe year \( mr rickles and mr humperdinck , for instance , will appear in atlantic city in the fall \) younger people , she said , like the new beach bars that have sprung up over the last couple of years and the casinos have tried to give them something different in entertainment those who ventured out of house of blues after government mule , for instance , could have strolled down the boardwalk a couple of blocks and headed to nikki beach , resorts' new beach club , and watched live boxing matches in a ring set up outside near the bar something no one would have envisioned in the old atlantic city entertainment scene as usual , too , atlantic city is doing something las vegas did , just a bit later i think las vegas saw this shift maybe eight or nine years ago , said audrey oswell , president and chief executive of resorts atlantic city each property there , though , is more focused on the market they want in atlantic city , we tend to try to please a wider audience if house of blues is the mecca of the new in atlantic city , resorts can claim to be the keeper of the old it was the first casino in town when it opened in 1978 mr lawrence rolled the first dice and he and ms gorme were the first act at resorts boardwalk s entrance are a bouquet of entertainers' handprints , footprints and signatures in cement that speak to another era those of perry como , milton berle , dom deluise , barry manilow , shecky greene and , in their own special place , frank sinatra we still have core customers who are 60 , 70 , 80 years old , ms oswell said we have a 94yearold in our database and want to keep someone like that happy , too bigname rappers like ja rule and snoop dogg have played resorts , but later this month , tom jones will several years ago , trump taj mahal even had britney spears in concert , a treat , mr gietka said , for the young daughters of high rollers he said that only in that kind of case , where the star was at the top , would something like that succeed it may be , too , he said , that at the other end of the age spectrum , time is running out in atlantic city for all but the most prominent entertainers tony bennett still draws , and to some extent paul anka , mr gietka said sinatra would definitely do well , as would bobby darin if he were alive this is beginning to change , and from where i sit , you have to be proactive in that change if you are only going to market to that customer , you are going to market yourself right out of the business
two and a half seasons into the life of zankel hall , the evidence is in one of the newest auditoriums in new york , built into the bedrock below carnegie hall , has added a dose of richness to the concert scene the array of performances has been broad zankel is living up to the vision that it would be an important source of educational programming the acoustics , apart from the rumble of the nearby subway , are generally considered good , or at least have not been a subject of complaint and at an average capacity of 600 seats , the hall has occupied the gap between the city s small concert halls and bigtime arenas like carnegie s main stage , which seats 2 , 800 it has filled an intermediary niche that i think has turned out to be extremely valuable , said john schaefer , the host of soundcheck on wnycfm and a close observer of the contemporary music scene but on one score , zankel has failed to live up to the early hype when carnegie hall officials first talked about plans for the space , they referred proudly to the way its seating and stage could be reconfigured with stateoftheart technology one press release listed that flexibility as the most important priority after acoustics millions of dollars of the hall s 72 million cost were added to create flexibility one part of that flexibility was the option to change the seating configuration , including the stage at the end or in the middle a pit , if necessary or just a flat floor with no seats the needed floor lifts and chair wagons alone cost 35 million , carnegie hall said so how many times has the configuration changed for a performance \? exactly once the seats were rearranged to surround the performers on three sides at the start of last season , for two days of concerts by yoyo ma and the silk road project no reconfiguration is planned until silk road concerts next season in fact , the change from end stage to center stage has been carried out only two other times once for practice and once for a promotional video i do wish that they would actually use that versatility more , mr schaefer said sometimes , you can alter the concert experience simply by altering the layout of the concert hall the reconfiguration issue is , of course , just one element of the zankel story as a major new concert hall in new york , it provides an eclectic slate of performances and educational presentations according to carnegie , 84 concerts took place last season , about half of them sold out slightly more than half of the concerts consisted of nonclassical music , including world , pop , folk , jazz and music theater this season there are 80 concerts on the roster educational events have grown in the first three seasons first 22 , then 31 , then 38 , a carnegie spokeswoman , ann diebold , said this month has included performances by meredith monk the american composers orchestra , combining music with a film projection and dance in one piece the english concert michael feinstein the guitarvocal duo of richard shindell and lucy kaplansky and chava alberstein , a singer this season also features perspectives concerts by the pianist richard goode and youssou n 'dour , the senegalese musician the gangbe brass band from west africa suzanne vega and the tenor ian bostridge big names are willing to do more experimental performances , protected by the embrace of the carnegie brand artists who play a run at zankel , like the brazilian singersongwriter caetano veloso , have added a concert in the big hall audience members who might never have entered carnegie s doors are drawn by its eclectic offerings , hall officials say it has opened the building up , said clive gillinson , the executive and artistic director even without changed seating , zankel hall allows for a broad variety of treatments , through theaterlevel lighting and sophisticated audio and visual equipment the end stage can be adjusted to three sizes , and the garage behind it , where the seatbearing wagons can be stored , is a handy receptacle for instruments and equipment a control room allows for twoway video and audio hookups for longdistancelearning events strictly classical concerts require a fairly straightforward setup but with so many nonclassical events , carnegie officials say , the hall s innovative equipment is used often those officials did not shy away from providing information about the rarely invoked seating flexibility indeed , they offered a spirited defense of their use of it the hall is still young , they said and with a rare chance to remodel , it was prudent to seize the moment for topoftheline features the administration that planned the hall is no longer there the stage configuration , frankly , is something that was designed for future use , said ara guzelimian , carnegie s senior director and artistic adviser mr gillinson , who took over this season , said the flexible seating was only one element in a range of features at carnegie s three halls \( the third being weill recital hall , upstairs \) that will be taken into consideration for programming there will be definitely , as time goes by , things where we seek to use every aspect of the halls , he said what you 're asking about is just part of that to be driven by an opportunity is n't the way we want to look at artistic planning the director for program planning and operations , anna weber , said none of the performers who had rented zankel apart from carnegie s own presentations had asked for a change in configuration i assume that in the future if there is some contemporarymusic ensemble that dictates a change in the stage , we will use it , she said carnegie s own presentations until now , other than the silk road concerts , have not required it , ms weber said as the coordinator of the programs , ms weber must choreograph a delicate ballet , making sure , for example , that amplified zankel concerts with loud bass thumps do not interfere with concerts in carnegie s main hall those thumps have been heard on at least one occasion , she said \( carnegie officials said that they had received no direct complaints about the rumbling of nearby subways , which can occasionally be heard during unamplified concerts the noise was an initial concern when zankel opened in september 2003 , and critics have loudly taken note \) the director of administration , richard malenka , who oversaw the theater s construction , said he was not troubled by the limited use of the flexible seating so far , noting that it was always viewed as a longterm benefit we have very limited opportunities for expansion , he said the only way we can go is down some 6 , 300 cubic yards of bedrock were removed to a depth of 22 feet to create zankel hall carefully , to avoid damaging the historic building and one of the world s great concert halls above an unknown amount was excavated to make room for the hallaltering machinery , mr malenka said kate d levin , new york s cultural affairs commissioner , said she was not disappointed at how zankel hall had been used the city , which owns carnegie hall and the land under it , contributed 34 million to the hall s construction given the complexities of the architecture there , ms levin said , better they be ambitious and build in functionality rather than wish they had the city supported zankel as a way to make carnegie more flexible , attract a different audience and add concerts , she said on those terms it s been an outstanding success , she added the programming that they do , and the response to that programming , is probably beyond their wildest dreams various reasons account for why the hall has rarely been reconfigured for one thing , the carnegie executive and artistic director who envisioned the hall , the muchrespected judith arron , died at the end of 1998 , before the hall was built \( or more precisely , recreated an earlier version dates to carnegie hall s beginnings , and it was more recently a movie theater \) robert harth , the executive and artistic director who planned the first season , died in 2004 because of the changes here , mr gillinson said , it was an actual generation later when filling the hall with actual concerts came cost may also be an issue i think they use it far less than anybody ever expected just because it s too expensive , joshua dachs , a theater designer and consultant to lincoln center , said people used to say the three highest paid employees of carnegie hall are the executive director and two stagehands , and not necessarily in that order mr schaefer , the wnyc host , agreed the real challenge is not how do you do it , he said , it s how do you afford it can you make those decisions without constantly being driven simply by the fact that it costs so much money to do it \? reconfiguring zankel hall takes six stagehands and about eight hours , mr malenka said , and costs nearly 5 , 000 so to create a surroundseating arrangement and then restore the end stage would cost almost 10 , 000 the transformation absolutely has costs associated with it , mr gillinson said but we 've done things down there that are extremely expensive essentially , the seats rest on giant wagons , weighing more than 2 , 000 pounds they in turn sit on floor lifts that rise and fall on screw jacks and can glide on compressed air like air hockey , mr malenka said in and out of a garage area on the wall behind the end stage mr dachs said 18thcentury theaters also had systems of moving banks of seats around , but used ropeandpulley technology several other music auditoriums have similar arrangements the new hall for the nashville symphony orchestra , which is scheduled to open in september , will allow the seats to be removed to create a flat floor , a technologically more advanced version of what happens at symphony hall for boston pops concerts the 500seat samueli theater , which is also to open in september , in conjunction with a new concert hall at the performing arts center in orange county , calif , can be reconfigured the frederick p rose hall , of jazz at lincoln center , has 11 towers of three levels of boxes that can be arranged behind the stage , and are often used , a spokeswoman said mr gillinson , carnegie s director , takes a larger view of zankel s seating flexibility it s much more , what are the big ideas \? , he said what we can do in zankel is part of the whole picture with carnegie s three halls , he added , you 've got a canvas for everything you want to conceive of
joe torre arrived at the parking lot on steinbrenner drive in tampa , fla , on monday , precisely when the street s namesake showed up hi , joseph , said george steinbrenner , the yankees' principal owner , and torre instantly felt at ease this was not a shadowy presence in a luxury box , a clipped voice on the telephone or a gathering threat from afar this was the outsized personality that torre has come to know and endure for 10 years as the yankees' manager over an hourlong meeting at legends field , torre and steinbrenner forged a d tente in their cold war we did n't use the word love , torre said at yankee stadium yesterday but it was pretty warm i felt very , very comfortable it was something more than cordial assured that steinbrenner still wanted him , torre announced he had decided to stay on as the yankees' manager but , torre revealed , he had been so worn down by steinbrenner s sniping that he considered resigning in the days after the yankees lost their division series in anaheim on oct 10 it was a waffle it was going back and forth , torre said , adding later , it certainly came to mind do i want to continue to do this \? after returning to new york on oct 11 , torre waited a week before speaking publicly he was exhausted and disappointed , he said , and he needed time with his family to gather his thoughts my words to him were , 'if you 're going to do this , you have to manage the stress well , ' torre s wife , ali , said yesterday at yankee stadium 'my only concern is your health i think you need to take a look at that and make sure you 're able to handle the stress management , because i want you around for a long time ' with two years and 132 million left on his contract , torre , 65 , had leverage but he did not want to come back simply for the money he had trouble sleeping he told his wife that his brain felt like scrambled eggs torre had become so disconnected from steinbrenner that he had no idea how steinbrenner would respond to the meeting torre wanted in tampa you 'd like to believe they still want you , torre said i knew that they had me whether they wanted me or not , because i had a contract but i did n't feel , going down 'aha , i got you' i still needed to have what i always needed , and that s the support , to tell me that they trust me last saturday , torre spoke about meeting with steinbrenner with randy levine , the yankees' president , and steve swindal , steinbrenner s soninlaw and the team s general partner levine and swindal encouraged the idea and said steinbrenner would be receptive on the flight to tampa on monday , levine told torre that the yankees wanted him back that was important , torre said , but he needed to hear it from steinbrenner the two met in private at legends field , before levine and swindal joined them i did n't have a very good time , torre said he told steinbrenner he said steinbrenner replied , none of us did still , torre sensed , steinbrenner seemed to have moved past the season s bitter ending , a firstround playoff loss despite a 203 million payroll steinbrenner told torre he supported him , but it was his manner that counted most i had to not only hear it , but hear the tone in which it was said , torre said george and i have not spoken everything was very abbreviated in the conversations we 've had over the last so many months or maybe over a year , other than spring training we 've really disconnected , basically they spoke no more than five times after spring training , and there was much left unsaid steinbrenner criticized the pitching coach mel stottlemyre in a newspaper article in may , and torre privately seethed in august , steinbrenner questioned torre s decision to let a lefthander , alan embree , pitch to the righthandedhitting paul konerko of the chicago white sox konerko homered in a game decided by a run torre explained the decision by saying that konerko hit worse against lefthanders yesterday , torre said the konerko criticism bothered him because of what he perceived as its underlying message it was n't like i was n't paying attention , torre said i think that s what probably bugged me more than anything in his meeting on monday , torre acknowledged that he raised the issue of steinbrenner funneling questions to him through reporters for the yes network torre said he asked for no guarantees that steinbrenner would change , but he encouraged steinbrenner to call him more often if he had a problem torre pledged to make more calls , too i needed to start fresh now , and hopefully we can all do a better job in not having it fester up like it did this year , torre said if something happens , address it right now that s my philosophy with players , and i really am determined to relieve the stress from my life by , if you have a question to ask , get it answered right now as their meeting went on , it became clear to torre that steinbrenner still valued his input steinbrenner asked torre about the team , and torre stressed the need to bolster the middle relief and find a regular center fielder joe and i had a great meeting yesterday , steinbrenner said in a statement issued by his spokesman , howard rubenstein we both look forward to bringing a championship back to new york and our great fans torre also endorsed leo mazzone as the yankees' next pitching coach mazzone is signed with the atlanta braves through nov 15 , but the yankees have received permission to talk with him torre worked with mazzone when he was the braves' manager in the 1980 s and mazzone was in the atlanta farm system he would n't be a stranger to me , torre said with torre back on board , the yankees will continue to try to persuade general manager brian cashman to return after his contract expires on oct 31 negotiations for a new deal are under way , although cashman may not need a facetoface meeting with steinbrenner because he speaks with him daily torre said he spoke about cashman at his meeting , and added that the yankees wanted him back i 'd be disappointed if brian left , torre said surprised \? with negotiations , you never know what s going to happen i know brian is like bernie williams , basically he s been here his whole life , so he knows the workings of it he s as strong as any individual i know in doing the job he s had to do here but i'm still hopeful that he 'll be signed cashman wants assurances that steinbrenner will listen to him more and his tampa advisers less there may be no way to legislate that point , but torre , at least , said he was confident the yankees could operate more efficiently now while acknowledging the tampa situation is difficult , torre said he expected to be consulted on personnel moves more often it is all about communication , torre said , before hitting on an even greater truth in steinbrenner s world probably , torre said , the thing that caused all of it is the fact that we were losing inside pitch joe torre said he did not expect the yankees to pursue starting pitchers this offseason the yankees already have contractual control of seven starters the starting pitching should be fine , torre said the freeagent center fielder bernie williams could return in a reduced role , torre said as the bench coach joe girardi tries to decide which team is more appealing to manage the florida marlins or the tampa bay devil rays he is consulting regularly with joe torre girardi seems to be poised with a couple of choices , torre said i talked to him last night it s wonderful torre did not dismiss don mattingly as a candidate for bench coach if girardi leaves , but he seemed to think mattingly should remain the hitting coach lee mazzilli , a former yankees coach who was fired as the orioles' manager this season , could be a candidate to replace girardi if he moves on

for more than a decade , the italian pop blues musician known as zucchero has been a star in his native italy and in neighboring countries he has released 11 albums , and he has recorded with rock luminaries including bono , sting and eric clapton but none of that won him an audience on these shores he had a small fan base in the united states , and his label , universal music italy , had released albums here , but they never sold many copies i was saying to myself , forget america already , zucchero said in an interview at his home , a rustic farm in tuscany so the gravelvoiced singer was surprised when , of all possible venues , starbucks expressed an interest in featuring his work his latest cd , zucchero co , is now featured on the stores' shelves and has sold more than 60 , 000 copies might the singer be the first artist to make the fully caffeinated transition from the land of cappuccino to the land of cafe americano \? for the first time in 15 years i 've arrived in the united states , and i'm very happy , he said it s something that was unexpected adelmo fornaciari , who was born in 1955 in the province of reggio emilia , italy , was given the name zucchero meaning sugar by a teacher who thought the boy was sweet and shy although he is not shy , he is by his own admission introverted i drink , i smoke , i never practice , and my voice becomes more interesting the older i get , he said his friend bono , he said , pushed him to reach american audiences my roots are italian and black music , which is not the typical italian style , but a mixture of soul , rhythmandblues , puccini and verdi , he said i'm not like bocelli , who americans love and is a crossover between pop and lyrical that s why it s harder for me well , perhaps some tastes just go better with a double shot of espresso and a halfskim froth on top if so , his ability to build a new audience one cup at a time will be of great interest to unheralded musicians at cafes around the world zucchero plans to come to the united states in december to promote the record and he is working on material for his new album , which he had planned to record in new orleans i have new orleans in my heart since i was 10 or 11 and fell in love with the music he looks out the window over the green tuscan hills i hope they 'll rebuild soon , but it wo n't be like before angela frucci
phoenix , aug 25 his recordbreaking home run had rocketed over the rightfield fence about 20 minutes earlier , which , of course , meant more phone calls and ticket requests and oh my goodnesses mike jacobs , the 24yearold with the matador s confidence and the california cool , was flipping open his cellphone to check his missed calls \( too many \) when he suddenly paused whoa , that s weird , he said , recoiling in front of his locker at bank one ballpark his eyes drifted toward the flatscreen television , where sportscenter was playing a clip of him trotting around third base he stood there and stared for a few seconds before being summoned from this bizarro alternate universe where he hits home runs with borrowed bats and plays first base with a borrowed glove and celebrates the next day by just chilling at the pool totally surreal , dude , jacobs said , finishing his thought surreal dreamlike mindboggling how else to explain what jacobs , after being called up from class aa binghamton on aug 17 , has done since manager willie randolph figured , hey , let s let the kid hit jacobs hit a home run in his first major league atbat and became the first player in major league history to hit four home runs in the first four days of his career , according to the elias sports bureau he is batting 500 \( 8 for 16 \) with 10 runs batted in while playing superb defense at first base , scooping wayward throws with ease or , in other words , pretending he did not spend the better part of six minor league seasons as a catcher i'm just trying to keep up with him , third baseman david wright said he s the one setting the pace jacobs bears an uncanny resemblance to val kilmer s iceman character from the movie top gun , and he sprinkles his speech with dudes and mans and pumped he still cannot fathom that , less than two weeks ago , he was given 20 daily for meal money and was enduring sevenhour bus rides to portland , me he had a 22game hitting streak in binghamton , but is now in the middle of a pennant race , another lateseason rookie phenomenon revitalizing a team s chances he is the latest incarnation of shane spencer , who , as a rookie with the yankees in 1998 , hit eight home runs and knocked in 21 runs over the final three weeks of the season jacobs is on a similar pace , one he will surely not maintain pitchers will start to find holes in that sweet lefthanded swing they will probe and prod until they determine he cannot hit this pitch or that but it has n't happened yet jacobs s first home run was on a changeup against washington s esteban loaiza then he hit one on another changeup then a slider then a fastball i just feel like this kid needs to continue to play and stay in this little rhythm he s in right now , randolph said drafted in the 38th round in 1999 out of grossmont junior college , jacobs reached class aa in 2003 he batted 329 and was named the organization s minor league player of the year in 2004 , he made class aaa norfolk out of spring training but lasted only six weeks before requiring surgery to repair his right labrum he could still throw accurately , but his arm strength had diminished slightly , and the mets told him to spend more time at first base i knew he 'd be good at it , binghamton manager jack lind said in a telephone interview he spent so much time working there that i just knew when piazza broke a bone in his left wrist , the mets wanted to recall mike difelice from class aaa norfolk but difelice was in toledo , ohio , and could not get to shea stadium in time so jacobs arrived and stayed on the bench , dressing by the showers in a locker that did not even have a nameplate he used one of floyd s bats to hit his homer sunday , then broke it tuesday while hitting a single so he asked victor diaz if he could borrow one of his 341 2inch , 32ounce bats jacobs s first baseman s mitt belongs to craig brazell , who gave it to him when brazell was with the mets during spring training the mets have started seven first basemen , but none with the power of jacobs so he could be sticking around for a little while , at least long enough to use his own equipment but this uniform s mine , he said these pants are mine they have my name on them that s pretty awesome , dude

three significant players made early departures from yesterday s yankeesmets game , and none were ruled out for the series finale this afternoon mets second baseman kazuo matsui , who made a crippling error friday , truly had a bad night s sleep and woke up yesterday with a sore neck center fielder carlos beltran , whose legs have been sore the past few days , strained his right quadriceps running from first to third base in the first inning yesterday in the sixth inning , yankees shortstop derek jeter was hit on the left elbow with a pitch from kris benson all three tried to play with their ailments , and none could matsui and beltran were taken out of the game after the fifth inning , when beltran could not run out a ground ball jeter was replaced by rey sanchez in the bottom of the sixth the mets are fortunate in that they have strong backups for beltran and matsui , considering that mike cameron is a twotime gold glove center fielder and miguel cairo was the yankees' second baseman last season i have n't changed the locks on my house , said cameron , referring to his domain in center field beltran and matsui are not giving up their spots just yet both said they might be able to play today depending on how they felt when they reported to shea stadium xrays on jeter s elbow were negative , and he also said that he hoped for a quick return the mets and the yankees did not mention the disabled list as a possibility for any of the players we 're just going to manage it day by day , beltran said the same goes for gary sheffield , who was scratched before the game because of soreness in his left hand with right field vacant , the yankees used hideki matsui there for the first time grounds for discontent even before a mets groundskeeper was charged wednesday with running a gambling ring , players have wondered whether the dirt infield at shea stadium is on the level the notorious playing surface again became a topic of conversation and controversy after the mets and the yankees combined to commit five errors friday night derek jeter made two errors in the same inning for the first time in three years , and kazuo matsui was booed for booting a routine doubleplay ball while matsui offered no excuses , jeter supplied the most pointed criticism of the infield at shea stadium they need to stop booing matsui and these guys when they miss balls , jeter told reporters after the game they should just give them a standing ovation when they catch one several mets sided with jeter yesterday and said that their home playing surface was the worst in the major leagues but third baseman david wright said the remaining groundskeepers had sought out several players and coaches recently to ask how they can improve the conditions they want to know what needs to be done to change it , wright said they are really inconsistent with the water on the field some days it s soggy and some days it s dry you get a lot of extra bounces you hear guys talk about it on the field , but our grounds crew is working on it as much as you 'd love to have an infield like yankee stadium , it s going to take time decision day on strickland the mets must decide today whether to promote relief pitcher scott strickland from class aaa norfolk or risk losing him to another team according to a clause in strickland s contract , he can be granted his release if he is not in the major leagues by tomorrow last sunday , the mets faced a similar deadline and negotiated another week to make up their mind on strickland , who last pitched for the team in 2003 before having elbow surgery the mets now seem prepared to let him go considering other options they have at norfolk and in the major leagues aaron heilman pitched out of the bullpen friday and could be groomed as a setup man because manager willie randolph is committed to using victor zambrano as a starter
leonard bernstein s candide opened on broadway in 1956 at the 1 , 300seat martin beck theater watching the new york city opera s production that opened on tuesday night , a revival of the acclaimed 1982 staging by harold prince last seen at the company more than 15 years ago , i only wished that this mostly delightful production of bernstein s richest musical theater work , with a book adapted from voltaire by hugh wheeler , could be played in a much smaller auditorium than the 2 , 700seat new york state theater there is much to like about the city opera s revival , especially the appealing cast headed by two musicaltheater veterans in top form john cullum in the double role of voltaire and dr pangloss , and judy kaye as the earthy old lady , with her vaguely jewishpolish accent , who is missing a buttock and full of tales about the calamities of her life still , it s frustrating to feel distanced from the performances , as you do in the state theater , which is simply too big for candide of course , this production , touted in 1982 as the opera house version of the work , was rethought , restaged and restored by bernstein , prince and a team of assistants with the state theater in mind it employs beefed up orchestrations and colorful \( though dustylooking \) sets that fill the stage with drops , props , sight gags and activity , too much activity for my taste and since there are performers from musical theater in the cast and wittily complex lyrics that must be audible , the city opera production , in the manner of broadway , uses body microphones for the major characters , including the opera singers the earpiercing sound of a coloratura soprano s amplified top notes is none too pleasant one magical moment showed what might have been in the rightsize house early in act i , young candide , the illegitimate cousin of cunegonde , the baron of westphalia s pampered daughter , gets caught frolicking with her in bed naturally , the horrified baron exiles him keith jameson , the boyish , sweetvoiced tenor playing candide , amply captures the hero s disarming charm and foolish gullibility banned from westphalia he wanders into the audience , walking between two rows of seats , edging past patrons as he sings the wistful and perplexed song it must be so suddenly the performance gains the extra intimacy it had been missing but enough no one would rather have a smaller home for the city opera than its director , paul kellogg , who is trying to bring this about meanwhile , there are good reasons to take in candide the soprano anna christy lends a ditsy touch of madeline kahn to her adorable portrayal of cunegonde and tosses off the daunting show piece glitter and be gay with brighttoned agility \( for tonight s performance and the two remaining matinees on saturday and march 19 , candide will be william ferguson and cunegonde will be georgia jarman \) the hardy baritone kyle pfortmiller makes a strapping maximilian , cunegonde s vain brother , so contentedly absorbed with his own beauty and perky stacey logan , whose boasts impressive broadway credits , brings a welcome dose of worldly wisdom to the role of paquette , the maid early on you sense that this paquette realizes that dr pangloss , with his best of all possible worlds bromides , is a dirty old phony but you ca n't help going soft for mr cullum , both as dr pangloss , who mentors and manipulates the young people like some lovably irascible wc fields , and the smoothtalking voltaire the conceit of presenting candide as a carnival show , dr voltaire s freaks wonders , before a chorus of onlookers who remain on stage , too often distracts attention from the main characters , the four young friends , as they are swept up in their variously improbable odysseys george manahan conducted a refreshingly relaxed account of a score , giving the music room to breathe and the words space to be spoken clearly the orchestra played bernstein s wondrous score very well on this night , except its shaky rendition of the overture the problem may have been caused by a pointless directorial touch the stage is filled with swirling smoke that drifts into the orchestra pit better to keep the stage lights off and let the musicians just play than to undermine bernstein s wondrous overture there are eight more performances of candide through march 19
bemidji , minn , march 23 looking back at all the pieces , some who knew jeff weise say they wonder why someone did not see his eruption coming months , or even years , ago there was the threat mr weise , 16 , once made on his own life , sending him away from his home on the red lake indian reservation for psychiatric treatment there were the pictures of bloodied bodies and guns he drew and shared freely with classmates there was the story he apparently wrote about a shooting spree at a school in a small town the clues were all there , said kim desjarlait , mr weise s stepaunt , who lives in minneapolis everything was laid out , right there , for the school or the authorities in red lake to see it coming i do n't want to blame red lake , but did they not put two and two together \? this kid was crying out , and those guys chose to ignore it they need to start focusing on their kids others , including the principal of the high school where , on monday , mr weise killed five students , a security guard , a teacher and then himself , defended their handling of the teenager , saying that the authorities had seen all there was at the time to see , and had actually been struggling madly to help a boy through his difficult youth we may need people to be more aware , the principal of red lake high school , chris dunshee , acknowledged on wednesday , after teachers and school board officials met privately for the first time for counseling but i think most of us felt like this was a troubled young man , and someone whose problems we felt like we were addressing beyond the outward signs of stress , however , there was another indication , far darker and more explicit , that people on the reservation said they had never seen or heard of mr weise s vast internet life though many here said mr weise spent a lot of time on his computer , many said they themselves did not have access to a computer , and all said they had never seen the alarming postings submitted under mr weise s name a loner in real life , mr weise , who also killed his grandfather and his grandfather s companion and wounded seven people on monday , found a community of sorts in cyberspace , confiding his problems with depression , loneliness and abuse to people who cheered his macabre short stories and drawings and sympathized with his racial ideologies on wednesday , some of his internet pen pals lamented that there had been warning signs they missed , including a gory zombie tale mr weise apparently wrote about a school shooting that mentioned columbine , an animated film he posted in which a killer committed suicide , and an eerie message that , in retrospect , seems to foreshadow his fate things are kind of rocky right now so i might disappear unexpectedly , mr weise wrote feb 6 on a web forum where members collaborate to write fiction last october , he posted an animated film on newgroundscom in it , a man shoots people with a rifle , unleashing flashes of red blood across a simple black and white drawing , then tosses a hand grenade into a police car , puts a pistol in his mouth and commits suicide when another member of the site wrote , was that like a warning message \? hmm dude you need help badly , mr weise , posting under the name regret , responded you obviously ca n't tell the difference between fantasy and reality , adding , do n't try judging my mental health based upon a simple animation , capisce \? in a yahoo profile last updated in june 2004 , mr weise used the moniker verlassen420 , combining hitler s birthday \( april 20 \) with a german word meaning forsaken or abandoned , said his nickname was totenkopf , german for death s head or skull , and included a doctored picture of himself with a monster s teeth and empty eyes under latest news he said he was on antidepressants , seeing a therapist and had a brand new pair of cuts on my wrists his favorite quote , which he attributed to hitler , was the law of existence requires uninterrupted killing so that the better may live on one web site , mr weise said last year that he had been accused of threatening to shoot up the school last april 20 , the fifth anniversary of the columbine shootings in colorado , but that he had been cleared on wednesday , mr dunshee declined to say whether mr weise was suspected of such a threat that will come out in the investigation , he said it is difficult , if not impossible , to verify mr weise s authorship of these internet postings without reviewing his computer the federal bureau of investigation said it would investigate them the postings are linked to a profile on www nazi org in which he introduced himself by name and said he was a high school student on the red lake indian reservation several people who communicated with him on the sites confirmed that the posts were made long before monday s massacre a spokeswoman for yahoo said the company s privacy policy prevented her from discussing the account operators of the other sites either refused to authenticate the postings or did not respond to inquiries the administrator of one forum , who asked that it not be named for fear the site would be crashed by overwhelming traffic , shared several private messages mr weise sent in which he said his mother drank excessively and abused him before the car accident that rendered her braindamaged and confined to a nursing home i have friends , but i'm basically a loner inside a group of loners , mr weise wrote , according to the administrator i'm excluded from anything and everything they do i'm never invited i do n't even know why they consider me a friend or i them in another message , mr weise wrote that his mother would hit me with anything she could get her hands on , and would tell me i was a mistake , and she would say so many things that its hard to deal with them or think of them without crying most troubling , perhaps , was the story of a shooting spree he posted on a site called writer s coven in december 2003 in it , he wrote of a character dressed all in black , a teacher with a hitleresque moustache , and complaints about how the shooting at columbine high had led to increased security on campus as in monday s rampage , one of the victims at his fictional school was the security guard or what was left of him , the story said , his throat having been ripped out , replaced by a bloody mass of torn tissue it went on in the distance , somewhere else in the school , the sound of a blood curdling scream echoed through the hallways but in mr weise s real school , red lake high , and among those who knew his family , the only true danger people said they had sensed was for mr weise s future and his happiness the high school students , who will not be allowed to return to the bulletridden school for at least a few more days , were expected to gather for counseling on thursday for the first time since monday s deaths there were a lot of signs of real trouble , said t'anna hanson , 21 , who knew mr weise and was the cousin of one victim he was confined to a computer all the time , and he had said last year that he was going to kill himself but somehow i was never scared of him i do n't know why not he never really showed that it could be directed this way some students said mr weise had shown them elaborate , disturbing drawings he made in his notebook , some of them depicting people with bullet holes in their heads , of halfliving people with blank stares , of skeletons none of the students interviewed said they reported the drawings to school officials they said they had viewed them as the odd but harmless doodlings of a strange boy he was different , you could say , out of place around here , said patrick tahahwah , 23 , who knew mr weise katherine s newman , a professor at princeton university , who edited the book rampage the social roots of school shootings in 2004 , said mr weise showed indications nearly identical to earlier gunmen his comments , his drawings , his social life they were classic signs of a pathway leading to a shooting the kid was literally giving off warnings , professor newman said but she cautioned against blaming school officials or others for not recognizing that , saying , it is exceedingly difficult to see these kids coming , to put it together and see the pattern mr weise , who wore eye makeup and a black trench coat that fell to the ground over his 6foot , 250pound frame , had been told recently not to study at school , but to study privately with a teacher at home the reason , the principal said , was to offer mr weise the extra help he needed , given what the principal described only as his issues mr weise , who had been held back in school , was teased because he was larger than most of the other sophomores , because he dressed in goth style and wandered around by himself , and , mr tahahwah said , because of his parents' fates everyone at red lake knew about that in july 1997 , mr weise s father , daryl lussier jr , killed himself in a standoff with the police on the red lake reservation , the tribe s home in far northern minnesota , about 30 miles from bemidji , the nearest city in march 1999 , his mother , joanne , suffered a brain injury when the car she was riding in struck a tractortrailer on a highway in minneapolis , ms desjarlait said the driver , a cousin of his mother , had been drinking and was killed after the accident , ms desjarlait said , mr weise , who had lived most of his life in minneapolis with his mother , was sent back to red lake to live with his grandparents he did not want to go , family members said though she knew mr weise had had a difficult adolescence , ms desjarlait said she still finds it hard to reconcile monday s shootings with the stepnephew she remembered from his younger years while he was growing up in minneapolis , she said , mr weise was a sweet boy who liked to go to movies , play outside , go to restaurants , and have friends over for sleepovers now , ms desjarlait said , the family is left to explain what happened something she said she has no answers to to mr weise s half brother , 7 , and half sister , 8 they know that he killed himself , but they do n't understand about the others about the size of it , she said i guess i do n't either i do n't how know it came to this but in a blog mr weise apparently kept on livejournalcom , he seemed to explain his swirl downward right about now i feel as low as i ever have , the january posting said i'm starting to regret sticking around i should 've taken the razor blade express last time around well , whatever , man maybe they 've got another shuttle comin' around sometime soon
pittsburgh , jan 15 the ben roethlisberger beef jerky is no less tangy the big ben tshirts are no less garishly fashionable and the roethlisburger remains inflationproof at 7 none of that was likely to change , regardless of what happened saturday at heinz field what was remarkable was the streak that inspired all that local commerce somehow remained perfect , even if the man behind it looked imperfect it took a couple of missed field goals and an effective running attack , spearheaded by two pro bowlcaliber backs , to bail him out but ben roethlisberger , the pittsburgh steelers' rookie quarterback , ran his streak of consecutive victories to 14 games and , in the process , probably grew up a bit , too with the steelers' 2017 overtime victory over the jets , the feeling in pittsburgh was that roethlisberger had to experience a little growth spurt to keep his streak , and his team s championship hopes , alive it was n't me out there today , roethlisberger said i did everything i could to lose this game in a season that has been magical for roethlisberger and his team , the only thing he can do wrong , it seems , is come close to producing a losing effort he bounced a couple of passes to hines ward and somehow plunked another off the stomach of dewayne robertson , the jets' 317pound defensive tackle roethlisberger was so ineffective in the first half \( 4 for 12 , 48 yards \) that coach bill cowher did not even bother to use his timeouts , even though the steelers had the potential to get the ball back with time left on the clock roethlisberger came out of his funk somewhat in the second half , but the mistakes he made had even bigger consequences one underthrown ball was returned 86 yards by the jets' reggie tongue for a touchdown , and an overthrown pass to plaxico burress with 1 minute 58 seconds left in the game was intercepted by david barrett to set up what could have been the winning score , except that doug brien s fieldgoal attempt hit the crossbar as always , the steelers had an effective running game jerome bettis \( 27 carries , 101 yards \) and duce staley \( 11 carries , 54 yards \) helped roethlisberger through some rough spots in his first playoff game i 've got to play better , said roethlisberger , referring to the steelers' game next sunday at heinz field for the american football conference championship we have to step it up the game we played today is not going to cut it roethlisberger was not sharp , but he did demonstrate the poise that has endeared him to his coach he does display a calm about him , cowher said he has the ability to move on to the next series during pittsburgh s final series , roethlisberger completed 3 of 4 passes for 30 yards and moved his team into jets territory from there , the combination of staley and bettis moved the ball into a position to allow jeff reed to convert the 33yard winning field goal roethlisberger s favorite target , ward \( 10 catches for 105 yards and a touchdown \) , called the game a great learning experience for his young quarterback , who did not disagree he also deflected rumors about a sore thumb and rejected the notion that any of his receivers should be blamed for his two interceptions he did say , however , that he may have made a mistake in not wearing his gloves enough in practices during the week unseasonably warm weather during the week made them unnecessary roethlisberger called the interceptions a misread on my part i made the mistake the mistake that resulted in tongue s touchdown came while roethlisberger was scrambling to avoid a rush and he badly underthrew antwaan randle el to set up barrett s big return roethlisberger admitted that he was probably trying to do too much on the play , but he took advantage of a similar opportunity in overtime , and it resulted in a 17yard completion to ward roethlisberger admitted to approaching his first playoff game as if it were just another game that approach was good for his nerves , but it produced mixed results maybe next week , he said , i need to be a little more stressed
san francisco , aug 16 last year a chinese mathematician , xiaoyun wang , shook up the insular world of code breakers by exposing a new vulnerability in a crucial american standard for data encryption on monday , she was scheduled to explain her discovery in a keynote address to an international group of researchers meeting in california but a standin had to take her place , because she was not able to enter the country indeed , only one of nine chinese researchers who sought to enter the country for the conference received a visa in time to attend although none of the scientists were officially denied visas by the united states consulate , officials at the state department and national academy of sciences said this week that the situation was not uncommon lengthy delays in issuing visas are now routine , they said , particularly for those involved in sensitive scientific and technical fields the visa snag angered organizers of the annual meeting of the international cryptology conference , who argued that restrictions originally created to prevent the transfer of advanced technologies from the united states are now having the opposite effect it s not a question of them stealing our jobs , said stuart haber , a hewlettpackard computer security expert who is program chairman for the meeting , crypto 2005 , being held this week in santa barbara we need to learn from them , but we are shooting ourselves in the foot mr haber and other researchers stressed that progress is made in the field of cryptography by continually investigating existing algorithms and systems for weaknesses , in efforts like ms wang s among scholars and software engineers , finding such obscure logical flaws is considered a badge of honor and not a hostile act ms wang , a mathematician at tsinghua university in beijing , and her student hongbo yu were scheduled to present a paper in santa barbara on monday on their successful attack on a united states government cryptographic function called sha1 sha1 is a formula for creating what mathematicians call a hash , a single number used to represent a larger message or a data file such algorithms are routinely used in encryption and authentication systems in addition to presenting the technical paper , ms wang had been planning on detailing further advances in her work during an informal session this week , according to several researchers attending the event after ms wang failed to obtain a visa , a third member of the research team , yiqun lisa yin , presented the paper instead on monday morning a chinese citizen , she is currently an independent security consultant in connecticut and has been a student of ronald l rivest , a prominent mit cryptographer an official at the national institute for standards and technology , which is responsible for maintaining the country s cryptographic standards , said that he was disappointed by ms wang s absence and that he had tried to intervene several times in recent weeks to persuade the state department to allow her to appear at the conference i have no idea why she did n't get her visa , said the official , william burr , the manager of the security technology group at the institute but i attempted to convince them that this was n't some strange woman i wanted to let them know that there was someone whose business was affected by her work and who was anxious to see her he said he was still hopeful that ms wang would be permitted to attend a technology conference that the institute has scheduled for october a state department spokeswoman said on monday that the potential time it takes for visa applications to be approved is clearly outlined on web sites maintained by united states embassies around the world i certainly do appreciate that this is a frustration , said the spokeswoman , angela aggeler , of the bureau of consular affairs we talk to people who experience this all the time she noted that chinese visas that require review under a scientific and technical category , known as mantis \( as in praying mantis \) , routinely take more than two months ms wang and her student both applied in early july ms wang was interviewed by consular officials on aug 9 , but typically two weeks are needed after such an interview for a visa to be processed last week , after the conference organizers realized that it was unlikely that ms wang would obtain a visa in time to attend the event , they contacted the white house science adviser , john h marburger iii , asking him to intervene with the state department \( asked if he had done so , mr marburger s office said only that such questions are routinely referred to the office of consular affairs \) the organizers noted that another chinese computer security expert , dingyi pei , a researcher at the state key laboratory of information security in beijing and head of the international cryptology conference s annual asia research conference , had not received a visa last year because of the delay last year , he applied this year in early june and had his interview july 19 , but did not get a visa until tuesday
to the editor re the harry da reid code \( column , nov 3 \) poke fun at harry reid , the senate minority leader , all you want the fact remains that none of the democrats cited by david brooks rushed our country into a war that has led to deaths of 2 , 000 american service members and more than 20 , 000 iraqi civilians a war opposed by the united nations and most of the world community in the first place if there was no republican attempt to manipulate intelligence , then none will be found samantha demby brooklyn , nov 3 , 2005
at 11 o'clock each night , after the powerpuff girls have been put to bed and scoobydoo has curled up in a corner , the cartoon network becomes a strange place from this hour until the early morning , a redeyed viewer will not see combative cats and mice or rascally rabbits , but rather an anthropomorphic milk shake that argues with space aliens , a hightech underwater lab where no one can find the fuse box , and a smalltown mayor who protects his city s streets by littering them with bear traps this is the unconventional , unpredictable sensibility of adult swim , the channel s latenight programming block aimed at animation fans who are grownups in age only since its premiere in 2000 , adult swim has struck numerous perplexed channelsurfers as unintelligible madness , yet there is a consistent , if counterintuitive , method to the shows that constitute it by turning its airwaves over to creative teams with no background in cartoons , it has repeatedly yielded programs that push the boundaries of what animation can do seth green , who played scott evil in the austin powers movies and is the newest initiate of the adult swim fraternity , is typical of the lineup s producers as well as its audience members he is young , male and incurably addicted to all forms of media his stopmotion , animated series , robot chicken , \( which had its premiere on feb 20 \) uses action figures to satirize retro childhood idols like the smurfs and gi joe , alongside more contemporary targets like the reality show blind date and the bbc sitcom the office as inventive and willfully arbitrary as robot chicken is , mr green says that those same qualities would make the program a tough fit on almost any other network 'adult swim' is one of the few places that is allowing people to take chances in any medium , not just cartoons , he said their argument is , 'you would n't get this on any other channel , but we 'll do it ' i 've always wanted to destroy television , said mike lazzo , cartoon network s senior vice president for programming and production , and the arbiter of all that is adult swim a 20year veteran of turner broadcasting \( who started in that company s shipping department \) , mr lazzo s earliest efforts at dismantling the medium came in the form of cartoon network s first original series , space ghost coast to coast when it had its debut in 1994 , coast to coast was a crude talkshow parody that mixed bits of recycled animation from hannabarbera s 60 sera superhero cartoon space ghost , with videotaped interviews of such offkilter celebrities as adam west and willie nelson but its producers quickly tired of using space ghost to send up routines they had seen on leno and letterman there was an ongoing debate , mr lazzo said , over whether or not the character should be used in a more conventional talkshow setting , or whether he was the king of dada the spirit of surrealism eventually won out , and the show became a showcase for such improbable comedy bits as a 10minute sequence in which space ghost stealthily creeps up behind an ant it was a combination of 'let s do things you do n't see on television' and 'let s do it so inexpensively they wo n't fire us , ' mr lazzo said encouraged by the cult success of coast to coast , cartoon network s executives began to seek out other homegrown series that could attract young adults , and in 2000 a second original show , aqua teen hunger force , was added to the latenight schedule created by the former coast to coast writers matt maiellaro and dave willis , aqua teen is nominally about the adventures of a trio of fastfood products a milkshake , a beef patty and a carton of french fries who live together in suburban new jersey but the three edible stooges are not action heroes so much as heroically lazy slackers who sit around the house and argue with one another when we pitched it , mr willis said , there was an element of 'they need to be detectives' something that people could grab onto you could n't pitch it as 'they live in a house and things just happen to them ' unlike coast to coast , the animation in aqua teen is all original , but it is produced at a minimal cost , using such readily available mac programs as apple s final cut pro and adobe s after effects though lacking the budget of a network cartoon like fox s simpsons \( which costs upward of 2 million an episode \) , the producers of aqua teen say they prefer the challenge , or have at least grown to accept it if we knew we could write anything and just pay to get it done , it would n't be as fun , mr maiellaro said it s more fun to say , 'let s have this action , ' and then try to figure out how to do that for 5 despite the limited resources available to adult swim programs , it is the constant improvisation and innovation demanded by those limits that has become the hallmark of the lineup with sealab 2021 , which joined adult swim in 2001 , the cocreators adam reed and matt thompson have put together a futuristic workplace comedy consisting almost entirely of animation that has been lifted from another forgotten hannabarbera adventure cartoon , sealab 2020 and using that finite palette , they have constructed memorable episodes like a segment in which sealab suffered a power failure , and the only onscreen visual for the entire show was an exterior shot of the lab , cloaked in darkness can you imagine walking up to an executive at nbc and saying , the whole episode is just going to be an exterior of the 'friends' apartment building \? mr thompson said and then they put that on tv \? as a liveaction series sealab 2021 could never work without the names george lucas and steven spielberg attached to its credits but as a cartoon it makes economic and aesthetic sense it uses a format if not actual clips that its viewers have known since childhood , and one better suited to this sort of anarchic experimentation you see a world and you 're familiar with that world , mr thompson said , because it looks like it did back then , and you can kind of remember this , but then we go in and betray the expectations of that world more recent additions to adult swim have become increasingly daring in the worlds that they create tim heidecker and eric wareheim s series tom goes to the mayor chronicles the exploits of an aspiring , if misguided , entrepreneur \( mr heidecker \) and an unctuous mayor \( mr wareheim \) eager to finance his crackpot schemes instead of using handdrawn characters , the two take photographs of themselves as they perform their dialogue , then run the pictures through a filter to make them look like lowquality photocopies these images are animated in a static , storyboard style against traditional , twodimensional backgrounds , creating a cartoon that best resembles a collaboration between monty python s terry gilliam and warner brothers' friz freleng the playful visuals of tom goes to the mayor are matched by its idiosyncratic sense of humor , one in which a meaningless catchphrase like rats off to ya ! \( a caption from a tshirt that tom fruitlessly tried to market \) can form the basis for a secret language shared by fans of the show there s no reason for anyone to be saying that , mr wareheim said there s no basis for it at all but people find little sayings like that , and it just takes over their lives it becomes special to them because it s theirs perhaps not surprisingly , the biggest fans of adult swim tend to be young men \( when nielsen begins tracking the block s ratings separately from cartoon network s daytime numbers at the end of this month , turner broadcasting expects adult swim to be the toprated basic cable network among 12to 34yearold males \) with a show like robot chicken , it is easy to see why its use of vintage playthings offers an instantly recognizable comfort to any viewer old enough to pine for his lost collection of star wars toys all the guys who were interested in action figures when they were young have gone on to incredibly stressful jobs , said mr green , 31 , a lifelong toy enthusiast you become an adult very quickly now , and i think everybody holds dear to a time when toys were the most important thing in their lives but mr reed , of sealab 2021 , said that there was something vaguely regressive about the appeal of the cartoons on adult swim , for those who watch them and those who make them it gets into that much larger social phenomenon of how modern american males are not grown up , he said everyone s 14 years old our parents' generation , they had two kids by the time they were our age , and a business we 're just living at home and watching tv mr lazzo said that adult swim had benefited from that fact that so many of its staff members spent their lives surrounded by cartoons and , as a result , never resigned themselves to the belief that animation was merely a children s medium i remember i was an oddity because i was still watching speed racer' at 15 , and none of my friends were , he said , referring to a 1960 s japanese series now , right down the hall from me , are a whole group of 20yearolds who are obsessed by anime this is coming out of the fact that people grow up with animation at a very early age , and they can see it 7 days a week , 24 hours a day it s not three hours on saturday morning anymore the adult swim creators acknowledge that there are many stigmas to overcome i went home to see my family for christmas , said mr heidecker , of tom goes to the mayor , and i was trying to enjoy myself , but this one uncle of mine , the first thing he says to me is , 'i saw your cartoon , but somebody has to explain what s funny about it to me ' suffice it to say that mr heidecker s response to his uncle would not be appropriate for a cartoon show
the state has agreed to lease eight amtrak locomotives that are the missing link in a plan to improve commuter rail service the locomotives will be used with rail cars purchased last year from virginia , according to a news release from the governor s office they will be leased for 20 , 000 each a month and the state will have an option to buy the locomotives through july 2007 , according to the release mrs rell said the deal reaffirmed her commitment to improving the state s rail system this agreement represents another important step in our overall plan to make the riding experience for commuters second to none , she said in the news release last year , 33 rail cars were purchased to increase seating capacity on the metronorth and shoreline east lines , said dennis schain , a spokesman for gov m jodi rell of the 26 cars delivered so far , only 10 are in service the additional locomotives will enable more cars to run mr schain said the deal had not been made final , but added that department of transportation officials had inspected the locomotives this is the first step in the process of finalizing the transaction and establishing a timetable to get them to connecticut , he said of the locomotives mr schain could not say when the new locomotives would arrive , or when more of the rail cars bought from virginia would be put into service jeff holtz
outside military circles , very few americans , palestinians or israelis are likely to have any clue as to who lt gen william ward is but he is about to become an important figure in the middle east his appointment yesterday by secretary of state condoleezza rice to keep an eye on israeli and palestinian armed forces is a welcome sign that at long last , america is tiptoeing back into the game in the israelipalestinian conflict general ward , the deputy commander of the united states army in europe , does n't come with quite the panache or stature of a henry kissinger or a george mitchell , who have both tried their hands at shuttle diplomacy in israel and the palestinian territories he s not even an anthony zinni , the retired marine general who spent a year as the special envoy , making fruitless trips to the region before stepping down in 2003 in fact , general ward has zero political credentials , long a requirement for making deals in a region where both sides tend to want to talk only to the toplevel types they believe can bring home agreements yesterday , critics of president bush s shortsighted handsoff policy in the middle east peace effort were already characterizing the appointment of general ward as a ploy to inoculate the president from complaints that america does n't give a whit about whether the palestinians ever get their own state some , or all , of that may well prove true , especially if mr bush fails to back up general ward the way he failed to back up general zinni but general ward s tasks are more clearly defined than those of his highranking predecessors in the world of middle east shuttle diplomacy , and he has something that none of them had the new palestinian leader mahmoud abbas mr abbas will arrive today at sharm el sheik , an egyptian seaside resort , for what could be a historic meeting with israel s prime minister , ariel sharon unlike yasir arafat , who was far more at ease as a fiery revolutionary than as a pragmatic statesman , mr abbas brings with him a realism that has been too long missing in palestinian affairs of state if mr abbas continues to speak forcefully against violence , and begins to back those words with action , he could well maneuver mr sharon in a direction that mr arafat could n't get him to go toward a real peace deal and a palestinian state that s all likely far , far down the road for now , we applaud general ward s appointment , and wish him all the best in his appointed task of helping to train and equip palestinian forces , and to monitor israeli and palestinian promises to suspend military actions against each other and we cross our fingers for an outcome at sharm el sheik today that goes beyond just the usual prisonerrelease announcements \( by the israelis \) and promises to halt useless attacks \( by the palestinians \)
chicago , sept 30 the federal aviation administrator announced on friday that a 15billion expansion of o'hare international airport was now cleared for takeoff but within hours of a ceremonial groundbreaking here , a federal court granted critics of the expansion a stay temporarily halting the federal approval the federal aviation administration estimates that the project , the most ambitious and expensive airport expansion in the united states would reduce delays at o'hare to 6 minutes from 17 minutes in good weather by 2018 , even as the total number of flights increases delays at o'hare frequently spiral out to clog airports coast to coast adding two runways and reconfiguring the existing six , the agency projects , will reduce badweather delays , to 20 minutes , from 61 two adjacent suburbs and a religious group that have long fought the expansion contend that it is illegal because the city has yet to secure financing and that the first amendment prevents relocating a church cemetery in the paths of the proposed runways the federal district court in washington accepted their request on friday for a stay to block the agency pending a review , noting that the order should not be construed in any way as a ruling on the merits the court challenge did not stop mayor richard m daley from celebrating in front of bulldozers on the grassy site of a proposed runway , telling scores of elected officials and business boosters that the agency s approval kicked off the largest jobcreating project in local history and would keep chicago the transportation hub of the northern hemisphere for years to come transportation has been the backbone of the chicago economy ever since the city was founded , mr daley said in remarks interrupted several times by jets overhead first it was water , then railroads , then highways and then aviation today , he said , we are securing our economic future for generations mayor craig b johnson of elk grove village , a town of 35 , 000 just west of o'hare , expressed confidence that the suit opposing the plan would eventually expose flaws in it , pointing to a report in july by the inspector general of the federal transportation department that questioned the projections on delays and the costbenefit analysis it s like the wizard of oz , mr johnson said when you walk into the chamber with the wizard , he looks all mighty but when you pull back the curtain , you find a feeble old man that has no power same thing with o'hare they 've got all these fancy glossies today they 're going to have big bulldozers and tents but now with the courts , they 're going to pull back that curtain behind it , they 're going to find there s no plan that works the approval on friday focused on the first two phases of the 20year project , 59 percent of whose 75billion price tag would be covered by airport bonds 32 percent by increased fees for passengers , airlines and concessions and 9 percent by federal grants the aviation agency has not yet approved the city s request for 300million from its discretionary fund over 10 years for the first phase , and chicago will have to compete for that money with airport projects in atlanta and los angeles as the overall faa budget shrinks we can give them part of that , we can give them none of that , said a spokesman for the regional office of the agency , tony molinaro in washington , they have to weigh the benefits and what would be the best way to dole it out in a conference call with reporters , the aviation administrator , marion c blakey , said of the first two phases , we believe this is viable , we think it s practical , and we think the money will be there on the broader plan , including new terminals , ms blakey said , at a certain point , you begin to say we 'll cross that bridge executives at united airlines , whose hub is at o'hare , and american airlines praised the plan the president of the local air traffic controllers' union criticized it as overly aggressive and unwisely dependent on full completion to yield significant benefits instead of having a much cheaper and much quicker fix to the problem , they 've made it into this huge longterm extremely expensive unfunded project , the union president , craig burzych , said mr burzych said that o'hare needed a third parallel runway for badweather landings , but that the plan would realign six runways in parallel they 're going to regret it , he added representative jesse l jackson jr , the illinois democrat who has emerged as a leading opponent of the o'hare expansion and of mayor daley , said in a statement that the project would be akin to the big dig in boston and saddle a generation of chicago taxpayers and travelers with billions of dollars of debt and an airport that s as overcrowded and delayprone as today s for mr daley , who has been responding to a growing scandal over political influence in hiring at city hall , approval of the o'hare project was a welcome respite , embraced with a lavish antipasto spread under a clear blue sky that more than one speaker noted was ideal for flying mr daley , a democrat , went out of his way to give significant credit to former gov george ryan , a republican , whose criminal trial on corruption charges began this week without his leadership , we might not be here today , mr daley said , amplifying his booming voice and bringing steady claps from the crowd one happy traveler was senator richard j durbin , democrat of illinois , who said that the flight plan to o'hare expansion had been long and unexpectedly turbulent , but that now we 're buckled up for a smooth landing as a person who uses o'hare at least twice a week , every week , every year , he said , i ca n't wait
london , april 12 reed elsevier , owner of the lexisnexis databases , said tuesday that social security numbers , driver s license information and the addresses of 310 , 000 people may have been stolen , 10 times more than it originally reported last month the company said there were 59 separate instances in which unauthorized users may have fraudulently acquired personal identifying information through seisint , a unit of lexisnexis seisint compiles information from government records and holds personal data about most american citizens its data is used by employers making hiring decisions , landlords choosing tenants and by debt collectors among others unauthorized seisint users often used login names and passwords that were assigned to legitimate customers , the chief executive of the lexisnexis group , kurt sanford , said in an interview lexisnexis found that the thieves were using the login names assigned to former employees of seisint customers or were correctly guessing uncomplicated id and password combinations or accessing customers' systems through a virus , mr sanford said the announcement , along with reports earlier this year from choicepoint , another data broker , and bank of america that personal information may have been stolen , added fuel to calls to regulate the 5 billionayear databrokering industry the senate judiciary committee is currently holding hearings about the protection of personal data this shows how we do n't have a handle on how large and pervasive a problem identity theft really is , senator charles e schumer , democrat of new york , said in an email message when a company like lexisnexis so badly underestimates its own id theft breaches , it is clear that things are totally out of hand senator schumer and senator bill nelson , democrat of florida , said they were introducing a bill in congress calling for a ban on the sale of social security numbers and for tighter controls for companies like choicepoint and seisint several other pieces of legislation have been introduced over the last three months aimed at protecting consumer privacy and regulating data brokers not surprisingly , data brokering executives , including mr sanford , oppose some of the legislation , particularly the ban on the sale of social security numbers no matter how perfect security is , it s not going to stop identity theft in the united states , because of the amount of information that is already available on the internet and in public databases , mr sanford said instead , he said , more steps should be taken to control how credit is granted , particularly the way that credit cards are used and issued reed elsevier , a publisher based in london , said it would notify all 310 , 000 individuals affected , and offer free fraud insurance and credit bureau reports for a year it is also trying to improve its password system lexisnexis began investigating security at seisint in february , after customers complained about unexpectedly high monthly bills those bills were generated by unauthorized use of the customers' accounts reed elsevier said the announcement would have no immediate impact on its bottom line but its share price fell 103 percent on tuesday , closing at 530 pence in london no similar problems have occurred in europe because european union regulations do not allow companies to buy and sell an individual s personal data american security experts contend that the reed elsevier announcement will be followed by others this is just the tip of the iceberg , said stanton s gatewood , the university of georgia s chief information security officer and a lecturer on the issue of data security for so long , we 've depended on companies like lexisnexis , and the government , to secure our information , mr gatewood said but i'm here to tell you they 're no more secure than anything else on march 9 , reed elsevier gave the first sign there was a security problem with seisint , which it purchased for 775 million in july 2004 the company said then that data from 32 , 000 individuals may have been fraudulently obtained , and that it would contact them by letter so far , 2 percent of the individuals contacted have responded , reed said , and none of those have experienced any form of identity theft
most discussion these days about renewable energy focuses on wind and solar power , but suffolk county is about to begin a pilot program using another option , biodiesel and the town of brookhaven , which was already using biodiesel , is expanding its use of it in the united states , biodiesel is usually made from soybeans , but can be made from virtually any plant oil or even waste grease blended with petroleum diesel fuel or home heating oil , it requires no basic modifications to oil burners or diesel engines biodiesel is more expensive per gallon than conventional fuels but reduces emissions of greenhouse gases and other pollutants it also does not require the purchase of new kinds of vehicles or heavy investment in new technology like solar panels or windmills brookhaven is using solar and wind power at town hall and plans to make biodiesel blends available at six facilities this year , up from three the fuel will be used in trucks , sweepers and ambulances biodiesel has also been used for years by the navy by private truck fleets in the midwest by windsor , calif , for its garbage trucks by clark county , nev , for its school buses and by denver for its heavy vehicles biodiesel is really here now , a fuel for today and the future , william horak , the chairman of the energy , sciences and technology department at brookhaven national laboratory , said at a workshop on biodiesel held at the lab in early april it is a key technology , he said , for a world where petroleum is not our main source of energy the workshop highlighted the potential of biodiesel to reduce petroleum use and to reduce air pollution from home oil burners and heavyduty diesel trucks , buses and construction equipment two suffolk legislators , daniel losquadro , republican of shoreham , and vivian viloriafisher , democrat of east setauket , said that under legislation passed last november , the county would begin to use biodiesel within the next two months to replace 25 percent of the 350 , 000 gallons of diesel fuel it uses a year to cover the additional cost , the county allocated 25 , 000 in its budget what makes biodiesel so appealing is that it can be put in the same tanks , pumped through the same pumps , and burned in the same engines as diesel made from petroleum , mr losquadro said when brookhaven began using standard diesel fuel with a 20 percent blend of biodiesel for maintenance and utility vehicles in november 2002 , the change was seamless , with no perceived performance reduction , said dennis lynch , the environmental liaison to the town supervisor the town has used 112 , 000 gallons of biodiesel since then and expects to use 100 , 000 gallons this year a major topic at the workshop was using biodiesel for home heating thomas butcher , a research engineer at the brookhaven lab , said he had found that a 20 percent mix of biodiesel with standard no2 heating oil \( a mix known as b20 \) is very compatible with traditional home heating equipment and provides positive emission benefits biodiesel contains no sulfur , so a b20 blend cuts sulfur emissions by 20 percent and reduces the tiny particles implicated as a cause of asthma by about 15 percent , dr butcher said biodiesel also lowers emissions of carbon monoxide , carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide , the environmental protection agency said ralph mills , who owns a heating oil company in newburgh , ny , said at the workshop that when he tested b20 with about 100 customers this winter , he was concerned that the fuel might gel in very cold weather or clog filters and fuel lines but he had no problems b20 heating oil is sold by a small number of dealers in new england and pennsylvania , but not yet on long island paul nazzaro , a consultant to the national biodiesel board , a trade group supported by soybean farmers , said that the board had begun an effort to make biodiesel a standard part of home heating oil within three years skeptics point out that last year only about 30 million gallons of biodiesel were commercially produced in the united states by comparison , 67 billion gallons of heating oil are used a year but new production facilities , including a 30milliongallon plant in minnesota , will come on line this year until recently , 100 percent biodiesel cost 50 cents to 1 a gallon more than petroleum diesel or home heating oil prices for petroleum diesel and heating oil hit record highs recently , while a new federal excisetax credit cut the price of biodiesel , making blends more competitive david schildwachter sr , a diesel fuel wholesaler with a terminal near the whitestone bridge , said that his company sold more than a million gallons of b20 last year to the united states postal service , consolidated edison and other customers john shipman , the chief automotive engineer for con edison , said the company had experienced none of the leaks or other problems it worried about
lillian had already put in a full day s work at a cable company when she hit the streets of manhattan on a cold january night , heading out on her second job armed with a thermometer and a portable scale , she went to a branch of a wellknown coffee chain , not for a caffeine jolt , but for a shopping version of a sneak attack lillian , 29 , is a mystery shopper , hired to evaluate businesses anonymously , gauging how well they serve customers so seriously does she take her job that she would comment only if her surname and the name of the business she was scrutinizing were not used although mystery shoppers also called secret shoppers have been around for decades , the business has grown rapidly in recent years according to the mystery shopping providers association , a trade group , nearly 700 companies now provide the service while mystery shopping is usually a parttime job or hobby , most participants take it very seriously you really have to invest a little bit of time , said cliff fill , a headhunter who lives in marietta , ga , and has been a secret shopper for seven years mr fill , 54 , said he got into the business because he thought it would make a difference in the way consumers are treated , and he could also take advantage of free meals or entertainment i get to go to some restaurants i would n't get to go to , see some movies i do n't have to pay for , and it gives me a little extra pocket change , he said shoppers who approach the work as a fulltime job say they can make 2 , 000 to 3 , 000 a month , usually earning 7 to 30 a visit , in addition to a stipend to cover purchases you do n't get rich as a mystery shopper , said cathy stucker , who has written a book on mystery shopping and has a free email course at www idealady com it s a way to make money doing something we enjoy in recent months , some online marketers have preyed on people interested in secret shopping , appearing to offer money to shop when they are really just trying to sell them goods and services ms stucker and others in the field say there is no reason to pay to become a mystery shopper or to get lists of companies seeking shoppers because the names of many reputable businesses are available on the internet one place to find legitimate opportunities is the web site of the mystery shopping providers association at www mysteryshop org most shops , as assignments are called , involve rather routine excursions to fastfood restaurants , gas stations , banks or department stores but in recent years , they have grown to include renting apartments , going to home sales and visiting health care clinics ms stucker said that on one assignment , she was sent to evaluate a hypnotist shoppers are given a list of criteria to check and may even be directed to seek out certain employees or ask specific questions once the assignment is completed , they must fill out a form from 2 to more than 20 pages long detailing the experience it s not uncommon for the shoppers to carry stopwatches so they can be specific about , say , how long it takes to be waited on some shoppers use hidden tape recorders to help them remember specific points mr fill remembered visiting a fastfood restaurant where the two young women working at the counter ignored him while they discussed their weekend dating plans after a minute and a half , they finally took note of him they said , 'we 'll be done with our conversation in a minute and be with you , ' he recalled while it s difficult to remain unperturbed , he said mystery shoppers should never reveal their mission that s one of the cardinal sins , he said the good thing is you know you 'll probably have a bigger effect by turning in a report than you would ever have saying anything to them matt robinson instituted a mystery shopper program at att wireless , which was acquired last year by cingular wireless , where he worked until recently as a national sales performance manager the program is used to evaluate the company s retail stores , and he said negative feedback from shoppers could have serious consequences , particularly for managers , who might be fired if problems were repeatedly found while most assignments go fairly smoothly , he said , there are exceptions he told of a recent case in which a mystery shopper was sent to one of the company s stores and was not helped for 30 minutes while the staff sat on the counters and talked about motorcycles that s when a store gets a zero , he said , and the proverbial bullets start to fly mr robinson said the company spent about 15 million a year to ensure that its 2 , 700 retail locations were monitored each month since being interviewed , mr robinson has left cingular mark siegel , a company spokesman , said mr robinson was not authorized to speak for the company , but declined to comment further jeff hall , president of the mystery shoppers' association and owner of second to none , a business in ann arbor , mich , that provides mystery shoppers and survey analysis , estimated that mystery shopping has grown 40 percent in 40 years , with significant growth in the last five years mr hall once worked in a restaurant that was visited by a mystery shopper he learned of the visit when the results were returned to the restaurant and became fascinated by the process he started second to none 16 years ago , and he estimates that its business will double this year from 2004 among the national retailers that are said by mystery shopper companies to use their services are walmart , mcdonald s , starbucks , blockbuster , jiffy lube , pf chang s restaurants , nordstrom and whole food markets mr hall said that of the 200 , 000 shoppers in his company s database , about 70 percent were women most have at least a bachelor s degree steven maskell , director of sales and marketing for shop'n chek , in atlanta , one of the oldest companies in the field , said shoppers in his database held more than 300 different job titles , including actor , nurse and police officer the company has about 140 , 000 shoppers in the united states and 60 , 000 more abroad i 've been doing this nine years , and i'm always surprised at why people do it , mr maskell said it s not for the money it s for the fun of it they like being a spy , and they love to see an improvement in customer service in their neighborhood and there are perks to be had mr maskell tells of a curb to curb evaluation he once did for british airways a firstclass roundtrip flight to london , where he stayed two days , all expenses paid he said that while some people try to make a career out of secret shopping , it is not something his company supports it limits the number of assignments to two a person per day , and about 18 a month shoppers , though , can work for as many companies as they like volitioncom , a web site about getting free stuff , has become the de facto water cooler for shoppers who want to

huntsville , ala , june 17 by most accounts , the united states auto industry is in deep trouble but do n't tell that to the newest workers here in alabama , where foreign carmakers are redefining the auto industry in america automakers from overseas first began building manufacturing plants in this country in the 1970 s , largely as a defensive response to protectionist threats but even as general motors and ford have been announcing thousands of job cuts , the foreign automakers are aggressively building new factories and expanding plants they opened not long ago in alabama alone , mercedesbenz has doubled the size of its plant outside tuscaloosa in the last year , while honda has done the same at its factory in lincoln a new plant from the korean automaker , hyundai , opened just last month in montgomery and toyota is adding 300 more workers here at its twoyearold plant in huntsville to produce powerful engines for the big pickup trucks that will be made in a factory opening next year in texas in other industries , american manufacturers have been some of the most avid investors abroad but in the case of the auto industry , the competition has been brought right to detroit s doorstep as the strongest foreign companies are moving to states eager for their investments , most of them in the deep south , and hiring workers seeking the stability that homegrown companies can no longer offer as a result , a quarter of all cars and trucks built in the united states are now made in factories owned by foreign automakers producing foreign brands , up from 18 percent in 2000 the assembly plants alone employ nearly 60 , 000 people , and that number continues to grow the employment at the american companies still dwarfs that of the newcomers automakers in detroit employ four times the hourly workers 250 , 000 but that number is continuing to fall already , gm has announced that it plans to cut 25 , 000 of those workers by 2008 union jobs at the big three plants pay a dollar or two more an hour about 26 an hour compared with 24 or 25 an hour for the nonunion jobs at the foreign plants but compensation at the american automakers swells to an average of 55 an hour when health care , cost of living and other benefits are counted , compared with 48 an hour , on average , at toyota toyota gets more out of its workers its plants operate at about 107 percent of the manufacturing capacity , meaning that they are constantly running on overtime , according to harbour associates , a consulting firm that tracks manufacturing by contrast , gm s plants are operating at only 75 percent of their capacity , harbour found for david herring , who grew up in pontiac , mich , outside of detroit , his new job at toyota s engine plant in huntsville is a return to the industry that employed his uncle and other family members , but that he had originally decided to avoid he earned a football scholarship to the university of north alabama and then became a social worker the job wore him down , he said , and he saw opportunity and stability at toyota basically , auto country is moving down south , said mr herring , 29 , who met toyota s president on his first day on the job he added , fate brought me here for the most part , the first wave of foreignowned plants were farther north , in places like ohio and kentucky , while the newest factories are concentrated in the deep south the state of alabama has been particularly generous in wooing auto companies in 1993 , it provided 258 million in incentives and tax breaks to land its first foreign automaker , mercedes the state has spent hundreds of millions since to attract the honda , hyundai and toyota plants but what may have clinched the deals was the state s laws similar to those on the books throughout much of the south that do not require workers to join unions even if their plants are organized the auto industry has found a welcome down here , said johnny l mathis , a business development manager with qore property sciences , a company that has prepared the construction sites for many of the new auto factories and parts plants since 2000 , the big three automakers have lost eight points of market share just to their japanese competition detroit now holds 57 percent of the american car market , while foreign automakers have 43 percent among the companies adding jobs , no company is courted more than toyota , the world s richest car company , which is gaining strength even as gm falters beyond expanding its engine plant here , where its ultimate investment will be 450 million , toyota is building a 1 billion factory in san antonio set to open next year with 4 , 000 workers and company officials are looking at even more places , including arkansas , to build additional factories toyota s impact on the nation s economy has been powerful a study by the center for automotive research , which has yet to be published , estimates that toyota s investments in the united states had led to 386 , 600 american jobs as of last year including jobs at suppliers and in surrounding communities that includes the 29 , 000 assembly workers at toyota s plants , plus another 74 , 000 people employed by the automaker in its california headquarters , design and engineering centers and at its dealerships and those figures do not include toyota s expansion plans in texas alone , the study estimates , toyota will help create another 9 , 000 jobs the impact helps explain why states are falling all over themselves to land a car company , said james t bolte , a toyota vice president in charge of the alabama plant in a state where the average wage is 31 , 000 a year , according to the commerce department , toyota s workers earn 45 , 000 on average , with overtime , plus a benefits package valued by the company at 10 , 000 workers receive medical , dental and life insurance coverage a traditional pension plan and a 401 \( k \) plan an allowance for child care and an annual cash bonus , which was 3 , 850 a worker last year prospective employees are lining up to apply for jobs at the new factories about 30 , 000 people vied for the 2 , 000 additional jobs at the gleaming white mercedes plant west of birmingham , where its workers dress in royal blue shirts that bear the company s threepointed star logo on the right shoulder and their names on the left for tammy young , 36 , the sprawling mercedes factory was a prize after being laid off at us steel s big birmingham operation , where she worked for nine years in between , she held a temporary job at the honda plant and worked at a dairy store the factory has just begun building the new rclass , a luxury station wagon , which will sell for about 50 , 000 it joins a new version of the mclass sport utility , the original vehicle produced here , whose sales are up 66 percent since it was updated last spring toyota , which opened its plant with 150 workers in 2003 , had 9 , 000 applications for those positions , even though jobs in an engine plant lack the allure and glamour of building cars at places like mercedes the process of getting a job at toyota is rigorous , meant to weed out those not meant for the repetitive , sometimes hot work inside the plant , which sits on 200 acres surrounded by cotton fields after interviews , job seekers had to complete five weeks of preemployment training at a center , which is run and paid for by the state , across the road from alabama am university the drill included exercises to see if they could work on teams and hours spent on a practice assembly line none of the applicants were paid anyone who was late or missed a training session was instantly cut the few successful applicants went through nine weeks more training inside the engine plant , including two hours a day in a fully equipped gym where they ran on treadmills and lifted weights to build endurance unlike plants run by detroit automakers , where a worker can spend 30 years screwing on the same parts , everyone on the toyota line is taught to do every type of assembly job , so they can switch positions when needed to keep production flowing it was hard , mr herring said , but it all had a purpose to many , the purpose is the stability of a job at toyota , which earned 48 billion in 2004 , as the detroit companies struggled jewal fossett ii , 31 , was encouraged to apply by his father , who had bounced from one ford job to another the younger mr fossett , who previously worked for mci , said he had one reason for applying i have my own family to raise noralyn lassiter , 22 , said she gave up her job as a customer service representative at directv , where she spent days at a desk on a headset now , she will stand for hours a day at a workstation , redolent with the faintly acrid smell of engine coolant but , she said , it s hard to find a job that you can stick with a long time lately , at least some toyota officials in japan have expressed concern that the automaker s rapid growth could cause political problems , with one senior executive proposing that the company might raise prices or temper its expansion to give gm and ford a break but , mr bolte , the toyota executive , is doubtful that the company is planning to retreat i have n't heard anybody say , slow down , ' he said correction june 24 , 2005 , friday an article in business day on wednesday about foreign automakers' aggressive expansion of production in the united states misstated the training received by applicants at the toyota plant in huntsville , ala it is 36 hours over nine days , not five weeks the article also misstated the size of the work force at the plant when it opened in 2003 there were 350 workers 150 is the number of those being added the article misstated the size of the force for a toyota plant in san antonio , which opens next year it is 2 , 000 , not 4 , 000
sebastian coe has endured trying moments in the job of leading london s bid for the 2012 olympics , with its public relations tempests and punishing travel schedule , but none quite so trying as the day of his mother s funeral as hard as it was to mourn her death , he immediately bade his family goodbye and left for a 23hour plane trip to australia to help pitch london s bid to a gathering of international olympic committee members in early april exhausted emotionally and physically , coe walked into the lobby of his hotel in brisbane , and the first person he saw was the nyc2012 founder , daniel l doctoroff they sat together for 15 minutes , stealing a break in their frenzied schedules simply to empathize he was very understanding he had lost a parent recently , too , coe said in a telephone interview from london last week it was a great display of humanity the five men leading the bids for the 2012 olympic finalist cities are an unusual peer group , sharing what has become a grueling job , only one of which will end happily when the ioc picks the 2012 city on july 6 the task of selling 117 ioc members on their city falls largely on these five men coe , a twotime olympic 1 , 500meter champion , plugs london tirelessly doctoroff , who doubles as new york s deputy mayor , does the same for his city paris leans on philippe baudillon , madrid on feliciano mayoral and moscow on valery p shantsev , the city s vice mayor we could create a trade union of bidders , baudillon said jokingly during a telephone interview in the new era of ioc rules , members are not allowed to travel to the bidding cities , an attempt to avoid the corruption unearthed in salt lake city s bid so wooing the hearts and votes of the committee members requires the bid leaders to chase them around the world , to every event deemed an appropriate meeting and with the competition so fierce among five powerhouse cities , no one dares miss even the smallest opportunity the five men hopscotch the globe in pursuit of votes , squeezing sales pitches into every meeting , no matter how short their schedules look like a flight attendant s doctoroff , long familiar with an arduous work schedule in his years as an investment banker , has given up wearing a watch one day last month , before leaving for another trip , he put one on but had not bothered to set it at 11 45 am , he glanced at it it read 6 15 i barely know what time zone i'm in , so i'm always waking up at funny hours , he said but i love it i can honestly say i have not regretted once the decision to do what i'm doing people say , 'how do you keep going \? ' but i say , 'when you love what you do , it s a lot easier ' the effort has heated up over the past year , with each city required to develop and file its bid book , play host to the evaluation commission and plunge into the most important work persuading the ioc members who will decide their fates this is the part that got the ioc into trouble before awarding the 2002 winter games to salt lake city the process devolved into a freeforall of personal favors the committee responded by expelling 10 members and rewriting its bidding rules in came the restrictions on when and how bid leaders could approach members the evaluation commission was created to judge the bids and to help the larger body choose the ioc is trying to make sure the decision is made on the technical merit of the bids , but i do n't think that is realistic , said charlie battle , nyc2012 s international relations director , who was involved in atlanta s successful bid for the 1996 games it is still a political and a personal decision that is where the bid leaders come in they know ioc members judge the cities partly on whether they trust the people in charge so , into the slivers of time the ioc allows contact , the bid leaders try to build relationships with voters , to build that trust baudillon got a head start on the field , having been part of paris s bid for the 1992 games , which went to barcelona , spain coe is known throughout olympic circles as a champion who has pushed for athletes' involvement in the ioc among mayoral s many posts in the olympic movement , he has been on two games coordination commissions shantsev is the former head of russia s ice hockey federation doctoroff is the relative newcomer to ioc circles it is one of the reasons he turned to battle for help doctoroff , 46 , not only does the traveling and schmoozing , but he also pays for it new york s bid , unlike the others , is financed exclusively by private money doctoroff pays all of his expenses he said his blackberry bill alone had topped 2 , 000 a month he juggles this pursuit with being deputy mayor for economic development and rebuilding \( he is also a husband and father of three \) coe , 48 , had to deal with his mother s illness and death , taking over the london bid when it was foundering he is a husband and father of four , all under 13 i told them , 'you wo n't see a lot of me , ' coe said they said , 'it s ok , because we want the games' it s the first job i 've had that they really understand those are the kinds of stories the bid leaders share they are among the few people who can understand the demands of their jobs so when they see each other at ioc gatherings , they often go out to dinner by all accounts , they put aside their rivalry we 've actually developed nice relationships that i hope will survive this process , doctoroff said there is a shared experience we always have a good time when we get together empathy , after all , is a valuable thing
jeanjacques rousseau restless genius by leo damrosch illustrated 566 pp houghton mifflin company 30 the wellbehaved biographical subject follows a haphazard course to his destiny he shies from the predictable , shuns the inexorable , plummets into sand traps which makes jeanjacques rousseau a paragon of biographical good manners generally speaking , penniless provincials were not the stars of the 18th century rousseau s early years make the classic underachievers the churchills and einsteins look distinguished late blooming does n't even begin to cover it the future political theorist was a clumsy footman , a feckless clerk learning that he had written a successful opera , one of his former employers could only sputter what \? that imbecile \? in this fine new biography , leo damrosch , the ernest bernbaum professor of literature at harvard , sees rousseau s as a sort of cinderella story he is eloquent on the mouseandpumpkin phase , entirely central to the tale rousseau s early years are familiar to us from his confessions , but in jeanjacques rousseau restless genius , damrosch fleshes them out and corrects the record rousseau may have pioneered the art of autobiography , but he did not necessarily get his facts right born in geneva in 1712 to a calvinist watchmaker , he lost his mother as an infant a decade later his father abandoned him early on , rousseau distinguished himself for his lack of discipline his was a sort of hitandrun adolescence , untainted by formal education and wildly itinerant it reads like a picaresque , half sterne , half cervantes damrosch diagnoses dyslexia rousseau could think only at his own pace , and away from his desk he wrote with immense difficulty but attentiondeficit disorder sounds more like it in any event he was in no realm a stellar student he was a lousy linguist , and could neither dance nor fence he struggled with music \( the last did not stop him from composing , badly \) he proved somewhat more adept at petty theft his various scams include one on which the music man appears to have been based at 15 he defected to turin where evidently rousseau was one tough customer two baptisms were required to make him a roman catholic his first adventure with the church came complete with his first encounter with a male seducer on the subjects of both sex and religion he remained squeamish \( he would reconvert in l754 \) by the time he turned up in paris in the early 1740 s rousseau had proved himself unfit as a diplomatic secretary , a monk s interpreter , a tutor , a bureaucrat but along the way a funny thing happened to know nothing at almost 25 , and to want to learn everything , he noted , is to commit oneself to making the best use of one s time on his own and between scams and scenes , he had begun to imbibe books surely there is a parenting lesson in here somewhere what to make of the fact that the two seminal autobiographies of the 18th century were written by unschooled teenage runaways , rebellious workingclass sons , the original apprentices \? the city and the country mouse , ben franklin and rousseau were never to meet except in their legacies , but there are startling parallels in their early years none of them are lost on damrosch by contrast with franklin , rousseau began to write only as he floundered toward 40 a 1750 denunciation of modern civilization put him on the map that brief critique of progress ripened soon enough into a happy primitivism swimming against the enlightenment tide , rousseau argued that the fall from grace came with the invention of society \( even the impulse toward sex struck him as a social convention i am persuaded that a solitary person who grew up in a desert without books , instruction and women would die a virgin at whatever age he might reach \) to make a virtue of marginality was , for rousseau , tantamount to making one of necessity socially awkward , he was temperamental and insecure it is difficult to believe that anyone less hypersensitive to slights could have been so astute on the subject of oppression success brought society to the doorstep of the man who claimed to abhor it over a 16month period before his 50th birthday , rousseau produced three magisterial tomes the rapturous \( and eventless \) julie became the bestselling novel of the century in it rousseau put passion on the page on all 800 of them , in fact repeatedly he managed to turn his failings to his advantage his commonlaw wife gave birth to five children , each consigned to a foundling hospital \( rousseau explained later that they would have interfered with his work , which was no doubt true , if not necessarily the opinion of their mother \) from his remorse came the childrearing guide mile the protopreacher of family values was neither exactly a husband he never legally married nor father in the social contract , rousseau did nothing less than turn a political system on its head he pronounced the people sovereign , and one citizen as good as another he wrote religion off as a form of tyranny perhaps the ultimate tribute to that bombshell came later from napoleon it would have been better for the peace of france if this man had never existed in its author s lifetime the book did a great deal to validate his persecution complex the church led the charge rousseau fled to england , where outfitted in striped robe and velvet , goldtasseled hat he did not exactly fit in with the natives he did manage to indulge one of his greater talents , that of falling out with those who meant him well rousseau set such high standards for friendship that he was better off alone by his 50 s the hypersensitivity bordered on mania persecution has elevated my soul , he explained , courting it again and again he quarreled with david hume , the scottish philosopher who had offered him asylum , and with whom he was never reconciled in the delusional aftermath \( rousseau admitted later that he had succumbed to an attack of madness \) , he set about composing one of the earliest selfanalyses in the history of literature the paradox was perfectly consistent with the life confessions was published only posthumously it was some time before rousseau s ideas seeped into the drinking water in his own day he was provocative but also outlandish as damrosch puts it , rousseau was after all understood to be describing a state of nature that never existed , a political system that never could exist and an educational scheme that never should exist social inequality , the will of the people , inalienable rights were meaningless concepts when rousseau began ranting about them imagination was out of fashion he was tiptoeing around the asyetundiscovered unconscious he advocated idleness in the age of adam smith if he suffered for being so much out of step with his own century , he can too easily be overlooked in ours without founding a school it would have been inappropriate rousseau stands squarely if unsystematically at the root of democracy , autobiography , romanticism , childcentered education , even psychoanalysis damrosch restores him to us in all his originality , though his volume is a little spare in the philosophy department there are rather more of rousseau s paranoid ravings and persistent ramblings than of ideas in these pages in part damrosch is hobbled by a conundrum he acknowledges the social life is easier to document thanthe intellectual development there is no adequate way to explain how a man born in chains became so free in this case the reader is in no position to complain , however rousseau pioneered the concept that ideas fell out of experience , and the erratic , inventive urgency of the life is all here a delight to read , damrosch comes as close to rousseau s authentic self as we are likely to get stacy schiff is the author , most recently , of a great improvisation franklin , france , and the birth of america
moscow , feb 11 a month ago a small crowd of elderly men and women briefly blocked the highway to moscow s main international airport to protest changes in pension benefits it seemed insignificant then , but in retrospect it seems to have been the first stirrings of something long considered dead , or at least dormant , in russia the public protest in beslan , relatives of those killed in the siege of middle school no1 last september blocked the main highway across the north caucasus for three days in late january to protest the pace of the government s official investigation into the terrorist attack on the island of sakhalin in the far east , ecologists joined local villagers in blocking roads leading to new oil and gas projects to protest their effect on the environment and local tribal cultures in the last week alone , people representing liberal parties assembled near the kremlin in moscow to denounce the end of direct elections for governor and in st petersburg to protest the exclusion of political opponents from the city s official television station on thursday , transportation workers took to the streets in those cities , and a dozen others , to rail against the rising cost of gasoline , among other issues there is calm before the storm , and it is the beginning of the storm , said anatoly zykov , 55 , a bus driver from the moscow region who joined some 200 others outside the government headquarters known as the white house god forbid there should be bloodshed , but everyone is sick and tired an axiom here holds that russians are politically passive , but the protests unfolding in cities across 11 time zones is challenging that , while raising questions about public support for the country s course under president vladimir v putin the largest of the demonstrations have included no more than a few thousand protesters but taken together , they are the largest by far of mr putin s presidency and appear to signal a broadly felt , if illdefined , discontent the public anger has dented mr putin s ratings and rattled his government ministers , who responded slowly and confusedly to the first wave of protests over pensions before retreating in part on changes that the kremlin had pushed through a pliant parliament last summer mr putin s appointees have attributed the demonstrations to a disgruntled few , incited by agitators , but the protests show little sign of dissipating a coalition of political , social , environmental and labor organizations has called new rallies across the country for saturday , including two in moscow in the first four years of putin s regime , people had hope , said roman a dobrokhotov , 21 , a political science student at moscow state university and a leader of a new group called walking without putin nowadays , people understand that under authoritarian rule , development is impossible this government , this system , is not suitable for them he called the unrest the beginning of the liberal revolution , one modeled on ukraine s orange revolution late last year , when thousands poured into the streets to protest the former government s attempt to rig the election of president leonid d kuchma s successor for now , that seems unlikely in russia , where mr putin has near absolute control over the political system but the protests have emboldened and united his political opponents , from communists to liberals who only a few months ago appeared demoralized and increasingly marginalized opposition leaders claim that in the last month 500 , 000 people have taken to the streets we should expect a new and even bigger wave of protests this spring , said oleg v shein , a member of parliament representing the nationalist party motherland he predicted that coming government changes in housing and health care would bring more to the streets people no longer expect any help from the central authorities , he said and these people are growing five hundred thousand is not that big a number for a country like ours , but it is a start the immediate spark for this outpouring of protest was a decision to replace social benefits like free transport and subsidized telephone , electrical and housing payments with monthly cash payments starting at 7 mr putin s ministers argued the change was needed to rationalize an unwieldy system that weighed down the federal budget and swamped transit and public utilities with nonpaying customers , cutting money available to invest in upgrading decaying infrastructure more than 30 million russians including pensioners , veterans and invalids received the benefits , however facing the prospect of paying for them with cash supplements that they derided as meager , they took to the streets the first protests erupted spontaneously in a few cities after the prolonged new year s holiday break , but soon leaders of the communist and motherland parties helped organize more they also forced a vote of noconfidence in mr putin s government , which is led by prime minister mikhail y fradkov the vote , on wednesday , failed , but many proputin lawmakers signaled their fear of a potential voter backlash by not voting from the start , the benefits protest became a catalyst for other grievances , tapping into a growing discontent with mr putin s policies , not only in the social sphere in st petersburg , students joined in after the defense minister , sergei b ivanov , suggested that the government was considering ending the draft deferment for those in college after first ignoring the protests , mr putin criticized his appointees , as well as regional officials , who faced the brunt of the protests and the costs of trying to supplement the reduced benefits , which many did in some cities , those accused of organizing the protests were arrested , though they were later released mr putin s government and the majority party in parliament , united russia , tried to stem the discontent by raising spending by 4 billion to ease the benefits blow on wednesday , the parliament also voted to raise the minimum state pension by more than a third to nearly 32 a month military and security service members who also lost their free transport received raises as well and mr ivanov dropped his proposal to end college deferments for the draft the concessions appeared to ease the protests somewhat , but they also created new ones , like those in beslan and in sakhalin , where people vented their own grievances in moscow on thursday , 150 civilian workers gathered outside the defense ministry to demand the same level of raises given to those in uniform the transit workers took to the streets outside the white house here the same day their grievances included not only gasoline prices , but paltry wages , import restrictions that force airlines to use old russian airliners rather than buy new ones from the west , and the economic disparities that have created fortunes for a handful of politically connected tycoons while the country s majority remains poor i hope there will be a result , said valery popov , a road worker who continues working at 67 because he cannot afford to live in moscow on a pension when all the people start protesting , there will be a result if we all stay at home , there will be none
in the 19th century the nation of italy was created by joining regions that had maintained uncomfortably separate political existences depending on which italian you ask , the union may or may not have succeeded for understanding italian wines , though , it s fair to say it is a failure too often , deepseated regional differences among wines are lost as they are lumped together under the term italian while a love of wine and food may bind together italians from alto adige in the north to those in apulia in the south , the wines from each region are as different as the local grapes , soil , climate and culture you may already know and love amarones \( from veneto \) or chiantis \( from tuscany \) , but neither , as the dining section s wine panel found out , will help you much in deciphering the wines of sicily we approached our tasting of 25 sicilian reds with great anticipation few wine regions have undergone as thorough a transformation as sicily has in the last 20 years , and few are as unfamiliar for florence fabricant and me , along with our guests , howard horvath , the wine director at esca restaurant , and scott mayger , a consultant who worked most recently at barbuto in the west village , the tasting was a chance to reacquaint ourselves with a category that we find in restaurants all too rarely even in ancient times , sicily was known for producing vast quantities of wine but in the last two decades the tanks of cheap blending wine have given way to wines that at their best are fruity and embraceable yet retain the character and personality of the island it s not easy for a region that has been making wines out of the spotlight for centuries to give up the old ways , but in wine zones like faro in the northeast of sicily , cerasuolo di vittoria in the south and contessa entellina in the west , winemakers have modernized their farming techniques and improved their methods in the cellar occasionally , the urge to modernize has gone too far , and producers have eliminated their local grapes in favor of international varietals like cabernet sauvignon , merlot and syrah these are not necessarily bad wines we all liked a 2001 merlot from planeta , one of the biggest sicilian producers it was well made and enjoyable , but not a wine with much soul no , the most distinctive sicilian wines continue to be made primarily with the traditional sicilian grapes , most notably nero d'avola , which makes deep , rich wines , and , to a far lesser degree , frappato , lighter and more aromatic , and nerello mascarese , which is used primarily in the faro zone some have speculated that nero d'avola is related to syrah , and have even gone so far as to suggest that the name syrah was derived from the sicilian city siracusa perhaps , but that connection seems tenuous to me , even if one of the wines we liked best , the 2002 morgante don antonio riserva , which was made entirely of nero d'avola , reminded me of an australian shiraz , though one with enhanced acidity that cried out for tomato sauce when tasting a wide range of wines from an upandcoming region like sicily , you expect a fair share of clunkers although we did find a few bottles that tasted like assemblyline confections or of baked , overripe fruit , the overall quality was exceptional acrosstheboard drinkable , as mr horvath put it our favorite bottle was the 2000 nerobufaleffj \( nehroboofuhleffee \) from gulfi , made entirely of nero d'avola like most of these wines , it was easy to enjoy the gulfi and four other wines in our top 10 carried the designation igt , for indicazione geografica tipica , a term that gives government sanction to wines that meet less stringent rules regarding grape varieties or areas of production than required for wines that carry regional names , like contessa entellina or faro many forwardlooking producers opt for igt status rather than be bound by the regional rules but sometimes those rules encourage experimentation our no 2 wine , the graceful 2002 tancredi from donnafugata , meets the standards for the contessa entellina designation , even though it is an untraditional blend of 70 percent nero d'avola and 30 percent cabernet sauvignon that zone was created in 1993 , when blending experiments were well under way as a result , grapes as diverse as cabernet , syrah and pinot noir can be part of the mix maybe the authorities were on to something , because the cabernet lends the tancredi subtlety and an attractive cedary tinge by contrast , donnafugata s 2001 mille e una notte , a big , inky , powerful wine that was no 6 on our list , is 90 percent nero d'avola and 10 percent other local grapes it is also twice as expensive as the tancredi the donnafugatas were not the only example of price not quite correlating with quality our no 3 wine , a 2001 cerasuolo di vittoria from valle dell'acate , was our best value at 19 this wine , which gains freshness from the blending of nero d'avola with frappato , outperformed much more expensive wines , like our no 4 , a 2001 faro from palari for 58 not that we did n't like the palari it was dense and spicy , but also oaky palari makes a second wine , soprano , that sells for half the price of the faro i have long liked this wine , which is generally full of fruit and mineral flavors , but a 2000 soprano in our tasting did not make the cut if sicilian wines are going to succeed in making names for themselves , it will be because distinctive wines like the gulfi , the donnafugatas , the palaris and the valle dell'acate force people to take notice when they do , they will not imagine that these are great italian wines they will say , these are great sicilian wines , and that will be enough tasting report big , earthy and

when chris rock walked onstage to host the academy awards ceremony on sunday night , he got a standing ovation just for being there an encouraging sign that the establishmentheavy audience was eager for a show that was fresh and irreverent , with a whiff of the future that illusion lasted less than five minutes all those oscar voters in the audience were n't amused when mr rock started taking some mild jabs at the industry , as he did with an early joke that called jude law a secondrank star by the end of the evening , sean penn was jabbing back with the pompous comment that jude law is one of our finest actors , a humorless , selfimportant moment he seized before announcing hilary swank as the alltoopredictable bestactress winner for million dollar baby the rockpenn showdown , and the minisweep of top awards for baby , create a perfect snapshot of the dilemma the academy of motion picture arts and sciences faces it knows it ought to move into the 21st century but hates the idea mr rock s presence alone suggests that the oscar people know they have to shake things up , if only to compete with the long parade of televised awards shows that now precede it and take such a huge bite out of the academy awards' distinctiveness and glamour but the tepid response to even the slightest irreverence from the host , and the affection for the oldfashioned million dollar baby , send a more powerful message the academy prefers to remain entrenched in the past , clinging to its former glory that attitude also helps explain why this year s show was even duller than usual mr rock , probably our funniest comedian , is no fool he knew better than to try to turn the oscars into the chris rock show his few attempts to put his mark on the event fell flat , most conspicuously with a filmed routine in which he interviewed black moviegoers who loved the dopey wayans brothers comedy white chicks but had n't seen bestpicture nominees like the aviator or finding neverland the segment , suggesting that the oscars are out of touch with a huge swath of moviegoers , hit what is probably the academy s biggest fear , and landed in the audience with a silent thud because mr rock offered few improvised lines , his best moments came from his deadpan delivery , like introducing comedy superstar jeremy irons , but you do n't need chris rock for that he was soon trapped in the straitjacket of a deadly format , which takes the oscars too seriously for their own good and has undermined promising hosts like david letterman and steve martin why would anyone have expected anything different , when the program s producer , gil cates , had offered the same old moribund show 11 times before \? the very idea of gil cates and chris rock discussing comedy sounds like a saturday night live routine and with million dollar baby winning three of the four biggest prizes best picture , clint eastwood s for director and ms swank s for actress the awards themselves hint at how happy oscar voters are to linger in the past the film may be about a woman boxer , but it is shaped by a pure retro sensibility it s a throwback not only to 30 sera boxing movies but also to other oscarwinning films about underdogs , like rocky million dollar baby is , essentially , rocky with a tragic ending , the kind of familiar movie it is easy for the academy to embrace \( the grumbling from some advocacy groups about the film s theme of assisted suicide never got much traction \) but in the future the enthusiasm for such an unoriginal film may seem as inflated as the oscar for rocky does now the most original film to gather a handful of nominations this year , sideways , went the way of another fine , innovative movie , lost in translation , which in 2003 was also nominated for best director and best picture and , like sideways , won only for its screenplay the fate of sideways , like the choice of mr rock as host , says that the academy will let in a breath of fresh air , but quickly close the window before an actual breeze comes in but the oscars desperately need to escape the aura of d j vu after the golden globes , the broadcast film critics awards , the screen actors guild awards and others , television viewers have already seen ms swank thank clint eastwood and her boxing trainer , more than once they 've seen jamie foxx win bestactor awards for ray and have even seen him get teary when thanking his dead grandmother not only were there no surprises in the major categories , there was none of the contagious emotion that winners sometimes display how could ms swank and mr foxx not have expected to win \? even the obligatory trickle of tears down their faces seemed more of a prophecy fulfilled or maybe relief than a genuine expression of emotion the most unexpected moment in an acceptance came when the 74yearold mr eastwood thanked his 96year old mother , who was sitting in the audience as he said when accepting his bestdirector award , he had watched sidney lumet , who is 80 , receive the career achievement award and i figure i'm just a kid mr eastwood was as charming as ever , and seems to be as creatively alive great for him but in the backwardlooking world of the oscars , the idea of a 74yearold kid is awfully close to the truth that s the joke that should have hit a nerve
harry g frankfurt , 76 , is a moral philosopher of international reputation and a professor emeritus at princeton he is also the author of a book recently published by the princeton university press that is the first in the publishing house s distinguished history to carry a title most newspapers , including this one , would find unfit to print the work is called on bull the opening paragraph of the 67page essay is a model of reason and composition , repeatedly disrupted by that single obscenity one of the most salient features of our culture is that there is so much bull everyone knows this each of us contributes his share but we tend to take the situation for granted most people are rather confident of their ability to recognize bull and to avoid being taken in by it so the phenomenon has not aroused much deliberate concern , nor attracted much sustained inquiry the essay goes on to lament that lack of inquiry , despite the universality of the phenomenon even the most basic and preliminary questions about bull remain , after all , mr frankfurt writes , not only unanswered but unasked the balance of the work tries , with the help of wittgenstein , pound , st augustine and the spy novelist eric ambler , among others , to ask some of the preliminary questions to define the nature of a thing recognized by all but understood by none what is bull , after all \? mr frankfurt points out it is neither fish nor fowl those who produce it certainly are n't honest , but neither are they liars , given that the liar and the honest man are linked in their common , if not identical , regard for the truth it is impossible for someone to lie unless he thinks he knows the truth , mr frankfurt writes a person who lies is thereby responding to the truth , and he is to that extent respectful of it the bull artist , on the other hand , cares nothing for truth or falsehood the only thing that matters to him is getting away with what he says , mr frankfurt writes an advertiser or a politician or talk show host given to bull does not reject the authority of the truth , as the liar does , and oppose himself to it , he writes he pays no attention to it at all and this makes him , mr frankfurt says , potentially more harmful than any liar , because any culture and he means this culture rife with bull is one in danger of rejecting the possibility of knowing how things truly are it follows that any form of political argument or intellectual analysis or commercial appeal is only as legitimate , and true , as it is persuasive there is no other court of appeal the reader is left to imagine a culture in which institutions , leaders , events , ethics feel improvised and lacking in substance all that is solid , as marx once wrote , melts into air mr frankfurt is an unlikely slinger of barnyard expletives he is a courtly man , with a broad smile and a philosophic beard , and he lives in apparently decorous retirement with his wife , joan gilbert , in a lovely old house near the university on a visit there earlier this month , there was heifetz was on the stereo , good food and wine on the table but appearances , in this case , are somewhat misleading mr frankfurt spent much of his childhood in brooklyn , and still sees himself as a disputatious brooklynite one who still speaks of the dodgers as having betrayed us and , in any event , mr frankfurt is not particularly academic in the way he views his calling i got interested in philosophy because of two things , he said one is that i was never satisfied with the answers that were given to questions , and it seemed to me that philosophy was an attempt to get down to the bottom of things the other thing , he added , was that i could never make up my mind what i was interested in , and philosophy enabled you to be interested in anything those interests found expression in a small and scrupulous body of work that tries to make sense of free will , desire and love in closely reasoned but jargonfree prose , illustrated by examples of behavior \( philosophers speak of the frankfurt example \) that anyone would recognize he s dealing with very abstract matters , said sarah buss , who teaches philosophy at the university of iowa , but trying not to lose touch with the human condition his work keeps faith with that condition mr frankfurt s teaching shares with his prose a spirit ms buss , who was once his graduate student , defines as , come in and let s struggle with something he was very willing , she added , to say , 'i just do n't understand this ' the essay on bull arose from that kind of struggle in 1986 , mr frankfurt was teaching at yale , where he took part in a weekly seminar the idea was to get people of various disciplines to listen to a paper written by one of their number , after which everyone would talk about it over lunch mr frankfurt decided his contribution would be a paper on bull i had always been concerned about the importance of truth , he recalled , the way in which truth is foundational to civilization and the various deformities of it that were current i 'd been concerned about the prevalence of bull , he continued , and the lack of concern for truth and respect for truth that it represented i used the title i did , he added , because i wanted to talk about bull without any bull , so i did n't use 'humbug' or 'bunkum ' research was a problem the closest analogue came from socrates he called it rhetoric or sophistry , mr frankfurt said , and regarded philosophy as the great enemy of rhetoric and sophistry these were opposite , incompatible ways of persuading people , he added you could persuade them with rhetoric or bull with sophistic arguments that were n't really sound but that you could put over on people , or you could persuade them by philosophical arguments which were dedicated to rigor and clarity of thought mr frankfurt recalled that it took him about a month to write the essay , after which he delivered it to the humanities group i guess i should say it was received enthusiastically , he said , but they did n't know whether to laugh or to take it seriously some months after the reading , the essay , title intact , was published by the raritan review , a journal then edited by richard poirier , a distinguished literary critic in 1988 , mr frankfurt included it in the importance of what we care about , a collection of his essays the audience for academic journals and collections of philosophical essays is limited , however , and so the essay tended to be passed along , samizdat style , from one aficionado to another in the 20 years since it was published , mr frankfurt said , i do n't think a year has passed in which i have n't gotten one or two letters or emails from people about it one man from wales set some of the text to music another who worked in the financial industry wanted to create an annual award for the worst piece of analysis published in his field \( an idea apparently rejected by his superiors \) ga cohen , the chichele professor of social and political theory at all souls college , oxford university , has written two papers on the subject harry has a unique capacity to take a simple truth and draw from it very consequential implications , mr cohen said he is very good at identifying the potent elementary fact it was ian malcolm , the princeton university press editor responsible for philosophy , who approached mr frankfurt about publishing the essay as a standalone volume the only way the essay would get the audience it deserved was to publish it as a small book , he said i had a feeling it would sell , but we were n't quite prepared for the interest it got for mr frankfurt , who says it has always been his ambition to move philosophy back to what most people think of as philosophy , which is a concern with the problems of life and with understanding the world , the book might be considered a successful achievement but he finds he is still trying to get to the bottom of things , and has n't arrived when i reread it recently , he said at home , i was sort of disappointed it was n't as good as i 'd thought it was it was a fairly superficial and incomplete treatment of the subject why , he wondered , do we respond to bull in such a different way than we respond to lies \? when we find somebody lying , we get angry , we feel we 've been betrayed or violated or insulted in some way , and the liar is regarded as deceptive , deficient , morally at fault why we are more tolerant of bull than lying is something mr frankfurt believes would be worth considering why is lying regarded almost as a criminal act \? he asked , while bull is sort of cuddly and warm \? it s outside the realm of serious moral criticism why is that \?
the theater , 70 miles north of lansing , mich , was big and boomy and boxy , and a third empty the fans sat , six to a side , at long tables perpendicular to the stage a few dozen yards away , slot machines jangled , lights flashed , cards snapped onstage , the fraillooking singer hunched over the keyboard and bleated out a tune that the patient audience strained to recognize the singer , dressed as he always is in courtly dark garb , said little to the audience , though once or twice he emerged from behind the keyboard to play a harmonica solo from center stage the place was the soaring eagle casino and resort , and it was an odd rock 'n' roll show but it was the kind of show and the kind of site that bob dylan has increasingly made his own mr dylan , 64 , plays big cities , of course \( in april he played five nights in manhattan \) but more and more , he is choosing stranger settings state fairs , corporate events , urban street fairs and casinos \( from indian casinos like the turning stone in verona , ny , and the soaring eagle to more traditional ones in las vegas and reno \) he is now in the middle of his second summer barnstorming tour of minorleague baseball fields , like the osceola county stadium in kissimmee , fla , with willie nelson in tow mr dylan may be in the final phase of his long and iconoclastic life as a star , and for it he has chosen a very long and very iconoclastic tour 1 , 700 shows and counting , beginning in 1988 caught in an artistic crisis then , he decided to defibrillate his career and go back on the road accompanied by a small combo , he reintroduced himself to fans , sporting a lean energy and a commitment to exploring his nonpareil song catalog he shows no signs of slowing down , though he has lately replaced the guitar he has played for more than 45 years with a keyboard , causing speculation that back problems might be responsible for the switch \( through mr dylan s publicist at columbia records , his management said playing keyboards was just his musical preference and declined to comment otherwise for this article \) mr dylan has turned his act into one of the weirdest road shows in rock he rarely speaks to the crowd , and when he does , his remarks are often gnomic throwaways \( i had a big brass bed , but i sold it ! \) he plays some of his bestknown songs , but often in contrarian , almost unrecognizable versions , as if to dampen their anthemic qualities he highlights recent compositions more than most of his 60 s coevals , but these , too , are delivered as highly stylized , singsongy chants he strives to play as many kinds of places as possible , even playing successive nights in different theaters and clubs in large cities in other words , mr dylan seems to have developed an unparalleled commitment to sharing his art , but only on his own very specific terms of course , a hundred shows a year is not unheard of in the rock world some wellknown figures , mr nelson and bb king among them , play even more shows than mr dylan but no performer of similar stature has exhibited his decadesspanning commitment to the stage acts like bruce springsteen , the rolling stones and u2 tend to tour every two or three years as part of a grandly themed marketing package , complete with a new album , an intricate publicity strategy , tractor trailers to carry their massive stage sets later there is souvenir bricabrac like a live album or an hbo special for later dvd release mr dylan does none of that there are no themes , little publicity and no tractor trailers he just plays shows the writer paul williams , who founded crawdaddy , arguably the first rock magazine , in 1966 , said mr dylan s focus had moved away from recording in the last few decades this is his art form , he said , the performing these shows have none of the strict choreography of the modern rock concert major touring acts will charge hundreds of dollars for a tightly scripted performance , with one or two opportunities for spontaneity by contrast , mr dylan s small ensemble plays confidently during each set s few anchors , but watches somewhat warily during the rest of the show , as mr dylan decides which part of his huge repertory to sample next he would do anything from old folk songs , civil warera songs , up to standards , said the guitarist ge smith , who played with mr dylan at the start of what has become known as the neverending tour i remember once , we were playing in hollywood , and he played 'moon river ' unlike some of his peers , mr dylan does n't seem to be motivated primarily by money his ticket prices average a bit over 40 , according to gary bongiovanni , editor of the concert industry magazine pollstar that s significantly below the industry average bob is one guy who s realized it s not all about the money , said jerry mickleson , of jam productions in chicago it s about making music and making people happy it s not about charging 100 a ticket for the bob and willie tour , in 2004 , he added , tickets were 45 this year , they were 4950 still , finances may play a part in mr dylan s touring strategy casino shows are highly remunerative the soaring eagle had an uncharacteristically high 150 top ticket price , reflecting a high upfront fee for the artist he will never starve , but mr dylan did not come out of the 1960 s and 70 s with what could be called mccartney money howard sounes , in his dylan biography , down the highway , writes that mr dylan has had four generations of zimmermans and dylans to house at various times , besides two wives and , it seems , the odd mistress if mr dylan plays 100 shows a year before 4 , 000 fans at an average price of 40 a ticket , he may walk away with more than 5 million profit and of course , that s on top of the million or so albums he sells a year yet money does n't fully explain the restless nature of the touring , and it certainly does n't explain mr dylan s refusal to give the audience what it wants to hear , his casual approach to publicity , the small clubs or the costs involved in playing at different sites in the same city for some of his 1960 s peers , whose tours can gross in the nine figures , it s hardly worth leaving the hamptons for 5 million one clue to what mr dylan is doing may be found in the liner notes to the freewheelin' bob dylan , one of his early albums i do n't carry myself yet the way that big joe williams , woody guthrie , leadbelly and lightnin' hopkins have carried themselves , he said i hope to be able to someday , but they 're older people i sometimes am able to do it , but it happens , when it happens , unconsciously these figures are n't merely musical heroes they 're also counterpoints to mr dylan s casually decadent rock star peers , who happily cater to their fans' demands unlike them , mr dylan offers the audience only what he thinks they should want an opportunity to see an artist work he has even become something of a proselytizer for the road s healing powers a call from mr dylan encouraged the singer patti smith to go back on the road after a 16year hiatus he told me i should share what i do with the people , she said i think that resonates with his philosophy the journey mr dylan is on has eerie premonitions in his songs , nowhere more so than in like a rolling stone , whose refrain of no direction home can sound both ominous and triumphant i think when he sang 'no direction home , ' he s talking about being lost , kind of a stranger in a strange land , mr williams said and then ironically , it s how he chooses to live his life jonathan cott , the author of dylan , said i 've thought about it , and i know it s a clich , but i think he finds himself on the road 'finds' in both senses of the word i think for him the goal is the road there is a final issue , and a more sensitive one , given the singer s penchant for privacy beyond his relatively wellchronicled relationship with his first wife , sara , little is known about his private life until very recently , biographers were unfamiliar with the basic details of his family , and many fans do n't know that mr dylan was married for a second time , in the '80 s , to one of his gospelera backup singers , with whom he had a child the question , bluntly put , is what mr dylan is running away from , or to at the height of his fame , in the late 60 s , he famously took himself off the road for almost seven years to raise a family in something approximating peace what personal demons could compel a man to spend his late 40 s , then his entire 50 s and now his 60 s , away from home \? is it running away or finding your own path \? mr cott asked i do n't know
mission to america by walter kirn 271 pp doubleday 2395 over the past decade or so , walter kirn has been to literary journalism what bill gates is to software his graceful , authoritative reviews and essays have appeared in vanity fair , vogue and esquire he served stints as the book critic for new york and the literary editor of gq he is a contributor to time , and his work is featured regularly in these pages as well as in the new york times magazine and if this glamorous r sum is n't enough to drive envious freelancers wild , there s the added wormwood that kirn has accomplished most of his manhattan triumphs while living among the scenic splendors of montana but everybody has a hungry heart , as someone or other once observed , and kirn s success as a reviewer , those envious freelancers may take some small comfort in learning , is not quite what he had in mind in a 1999 interview with the princeton alumni weekly , kirn , class of '83 , said , my primary ambition is to be a fiction writer being a critic was n't an aspiration of mine kirn has indeed written fiction a collection of stories , my hard bargain \( 1990 \) , and three novels , she needed me \( 1992 \) , thumbsucker \( 1999 \) and up in the air \( 2001 \) all received respectful , occasionally rhapsodic attention none reached an audience anywhere near the size of that commanded by kirn s highcirculation , highly visible critical outlets so millions of readers know him as a critic who sometimes writes fiction rather than as a novelist who reviews on the side mission to america may tilt that imbalance in the other direction kirn s fourth novel is his most ambitious attempt yet to create an independent fictional universe , one that is less content than his previous books to piggyback on contemporary phenomena like the abortion debate \( she needed me \) , the therapy craze \( thumbsucker \) and the deracinated , unanchored world of frequent flyers \( up in the air \) at the same time , his story fuses two topics that have been prominent in american literature and the national dialogue almost from the beginning the seductive bounty of the new world and the spiritual rewards of organized religion mason plato laverle , the novel s young narrator , has spent his life in the isolated mountain valley town of bluff , mont , the headquarters and indeed the only enclave of the aboriginal fulfilled apostles we approved , that s the main thing , mason explains we approved abundantly we approved of the prince of flocks , whom others call christ , and of our god of gods , theallinone , but we also approved of a host of other divinities , majestic and humble , familiar and obscure , from tricky old coyote , the hopi spirit , to dainty lady vegetalis , a garden sylph of cloudy origins the opening chapters of mission to america , in which kirn fleshes out an imagined faith , are a tour de force of unobtrusive exposition \( mormonism , which has often figured in his previous fiction , clearly provided kirn with a helpful template \) we learn , as if by accident , of the apostles' mid19thcentury founder , the first of an unbroken line of seeresses a woman named lucy apostles call her mother she lived a life of quiet charmed attainment she mastered the whole hebrew language in one daydream scattered references enumerate the many dietary instructions handed down from mother lucy , including her emphasis on fish \( the only fresh fish to be found in bluff was trout \) there is the uneasy relationship with the rest of the united states , which church founders called terrestria , refusing at first to vote in its elections , supply troops for its armies or recognize its currency , and though they capitulated in 1913 in a bid to escape imprisonment , bluff had remained a world apart such isolation has come at a price despite their defining motto , what should be , is , the apostles realize that what is wo n't be for much longer yes , mason says , we were safe from assault , debased philosophies , bewildering images and harmful foodstuffs , but in our safety we 'd thinned and paled and dwindled our blood was weak , like children s milky tea ennis lauer , an apostle who has ventured into the outside world and won half a million dollars on a reality tv show , puts the case somewhat more bluntly to mason than he put it to himself this faith has turned into an endless ladies' tea that starts with a prayer and closes with a s ance and accomplishes precisely nothing except to turn tuesday into wednesday and february into march lauer has conceived and financed a plan to help prevent bluff s biological sunset young apostle men will go out to find brides to provide new bloodlines into our active breeding pool and also , not entirely as an afterthought , converts , preferably rich ones so it is that mason and elder elias stark , a former schoolmate , drive off in a green dodge camper into the roiling unknown of terrestria a compendious bibliography could be assembled of authors \( cervantes , montesquieu , swift , dr johnson , mark twain , to mention just a few marquee names \) who have set na fs loose on the open road , literal or figurative , for philosophic , satiric or comic effect kirn is aware of this tradition and makes a few feints in its direction mason , along with his partner , becomes awestruck at his first exposure to television and excitedly reports on squealing shows , in which terrestrians discontented with their clothing and furniture were showered with new things they were n't yet sick of yet kirn clearly is n't much interested in the sustained mockery of such easy targets nor does he make much of a mystery about whether his proseletyzing rubes will be corrupted by the depraved environment and people they meet on the outside elder stark succumbs almost immediately to the lure of junk food , from which it seems a short hop to crank and then , once he acquires some rich friends , to prescription drugs of uncertain provenance and purport mason is also changed by his mission , and that transformation forms the real subject of the novel zealotry is largely unknown among the apostles how could it be otherwise with a people who believe that what should be , is and that forgiveness and creation were the same act \? but mason is even less zealous than his coreligionists he cherishes his childhood in bluff we knew we were missing something by living there , but they , the outsiders , were missing something , too he admires but is uncertain about the usefulness of the truths set forth in mother lucy s discourses , the apostles' holy book , such as , the cheerful fall is the highest sort of flight from the moment he leaves bluff , mason understands that all he cared about in his past is lost he knows that lauer s plan is crazy he thinks , he tells elder , that we can win the hearts of two darling banker s daughters who ca n't wait to move to montana , drive junky cars , pray in a building with a cavedin roof , have three kids apiece and eat trout six times a week he s dreaming worse than that , lauer is back in bluff , where the 97yearold seeress is dying , reorganizing the faith s hierarchy and telling mason over the phone that if the church has any financial future at all , it s as a human growth enabler as it winds down , mission to america depends increasingly on zany plot developments a corrupt colorado zillionaire , a writer held hostage to construct the zillionaire s autobiography , a bison hunt for plutocrats all of which amounts to a letdown , of course , but also points toward the disappointment of most fictional endings , the tendency of inspired premises to fade into the light of common day but the glow of the initial vision remains after the book is closed writing criticism is to writing fiction and poetry as hugging the shore is to sailing in the open sea , john updike once observed with this novel , walter kirn has ventured into deep waters paul gray is a freelance writer who reviewed books for time magazine from 1974 to 2001
west tisbury , mass peering down mill brook toward tisbury great pond s town cove through the dense thickets of alders , winterberry , shadbush , viburnum and assorted greenbriers that form a canopy over much of the stream , we could see 8 mute swans and 12 canada geese in an icerimmed pool 150 yards away we had hoped to find ducks seeking the relative comfort of open water in the sheltered stream , rather than squatting on ice on the broad , frozen , windswept reaches of the pond , but there were none it was late january , the final day of 20045 waterfowling in the coastal region of massachusetts , and my younger son jeff and i had decided to take the afternoon off for our last hunt until next fall it had been bitterly cold for several days , nearly a foot of snow had fallen and a new storm , a blizzard , was predicted for that evening and the next day there was more emotion we had a yen to be abroad under dark , windtorn skies than logic in our decision to go forth that final day the pond had been frozen for nearly a week and on two other excursions we had encountered few ducks there is almost always open water in front of our blind , which is located at the brook s mouth , an icefree haven where dabbling ducks , mostly mallards , are wont to congregate and where they can also dine on vegetation in the brook and along its shores this year the open water was there but the pond was so high that much of the vegetation was unavailable to the dabblers with their long bodies and long necks , geese and swans can feed on the bottom in deeper water most of the season we had been able to walk down the brook to our blind in waders , but the rising pond had made that impossible nearly three weeks before , forcing us to use a small , albeit beamy , canoe there was no way we could sneak up on the 12 geese , so we eased ourselves into the canoe , waders , guns , decoys , bulky clothing and all i love canoes and feel comfortable in them under most conditions , but i was uneasy this time the temperatures were in the low teens , the wind was blowing hard out of the northwest , and snow was beginning to fall if we flip this craft , we could probably get to shore , i told myself , but could we , encumbered by waders and heavy watersoaked outer clothing and numbed by the cold , last long enough to get to our truck \? do n't make any quick moves , i said i was thinking the same thing , my 54yearold son replied , dipping his paddle delicately into the water the 12 geese departed before we had gone 20 yards the swans , not being legal game and having nothing to fear from us , simply swam as far away as the open water permitted a long , black shape , stark against the snow , rose up from a tangle of roots beneath an ancient maple in the swamp on my right it was a cormorant it lurched into the brook and swam on ahead of us there was plenty of open water within 10 yards of our blind , but the structure itself was surrounded by ice that was nearly two feet up its sides of tattered camouflage when the pond is open to the ocean , the bottom of the blind is more than a foot above the high tide mark i knew that the top of our bench in the blind would be underwater maybe we should say to hell with it , i said let s see how thick the ice is , jeff replied jeff , who was in the bow , hacked at it with his paddle it was about a halfinch thick , and within 15 minutes we were in the shallows and halfway to our destination jeff gingerly got out of the canoe and quickly completed a channel to the blind by kneeling on the ice until it gave way under his weight with two hours of shooting time left before sunset , we got into the blind and sat , icy water at our waists , waiting for our quarry to arrive the cormorant had paddled out into the open water before us it took wing and flew to a gnarled white oak , landed on a branch , lurched and fell 10 feet but recovered before it hit the ground and found a more secure perch it seemed confused we saw no more geese and no ducks in the first hour and a half snow building up on our parkas and in our beards , we talked of many things duck blinds , particularly when no birds are flying , are conducive to sustained flights of nostalgia near the end of our vigil , the numbing cold in my legs was spreading to my upper body and i was n't at all sure that i would be able , should the need arise , to mount and fire my gun with any degree of celerity a small flock of geese i am sure it was the band that we had disturbed earlier in the day emerged from the swirling white , veered and passed to my right they were well within range , but they were flying over a dense portion of the swamp knowing that we probably could n't get to any bird that fell in that area , i did n't shoot less than a minute later , a drake mallard , the only duck we saw that day , materialized above jeff , who shot , well behind the drake then we called it quits we paddled back up the brook in the driving snow and i was strangely content when we reached our landing without mishap the years modify a hunter s quest
boston , april 12 alex rodriguez made his major league debut at fenway park when he was 18 years old , in july 1994 his wife cynthia s family is from new england two winters ago , the red sox were aching to deal for rodriguez , who spoke eagerly of his love for the team but that was before the players union intervened and blocked a potential trade and before aaron boone played pickup basketball on a boring winter night and before the red sox blitzed rodriguez and the yankees in the last four games of the american league championship series in october rodriguez is not the only elite player without a world series ring barry bonds , sammy sosa , rafael palmeiro and ken griffey jr and rodriguez s yankees teammates mike mussina and jason giambi are lacking one , too but none of those players came close to joining the red sox the year they overcame an 86year curse at this point , it s trivial , rodriguez said after the yankees' 81 loss monday i'm where i want to be , and they won a world championship the red sox received their rings monday , then built a 41 lead against mussina it was already a glorious day for their fans , and rodriguez s fourthinning error seemed to make it even sweeter the fans jeered rodriguez when he handled his next chance cleanly , chanting his name and turning him into an object of ridicule rodriguez has two more chances to silence the fans before the yankees and the red sox part ways until their next series , on memorial day weekend on wednesday , curt schilling returns from the disabled list and starts for the red sox on thursday , bronson arroyo faces the yankees schilling and arroyo have traded barbs with rodriguez since an infamous play in game 6 of the alcs , when rodriguez illegally slapped a ball from arroyo s glove schilling called it a bushleague play rodriguez retorted months later by mocking schilling for crying on the bench in game 1 of the series and for not talking after that game \( those accusations were false \) asked monday if he was looking forward to seeing schilling , rodriguez took a moment to answer and said , i'm going to reserve any comments on that one the yankees , at 34 , are off to a ragged start , struggling at times to subdue the powerful lineups of the red sox and the baltimore orioles in a seasonopening threegame series , the yankees' starters had a 245 earned run average against boston since then , in four games against the orioles and the red sox , the starters' era has been 794 the defense has not helped the pitching the yankees have allowed 10 unearned runs this season , and errors by rodriguez have led to seven , all against the red sox his first error was physical , and the second might have been an error in judgment last wednesday at yankee stadium , with the bases loaded , one out and the yankees leading by one , manny ramirez hit a sharp grounder to rodriguez at third rodriguez said he planned to field the ball and fire to second to start a gameending double play it was a highpercentage play , the right instinct , and when rodriguez could not gather the ball , he instantly knew his best option was to throw home for a force but he dropped the ball again , and the tying run scored off mariano rivera on monday , with two outs and a runner on first , rodriguez admitted , he was probably too conscious of the speed of the hitter , johnny damon , a lefthander who is quick out of the batter s box rodriguez tried to charge damon s grounder instead of staying back and using his strong arm his best defensive asset to peg damon at first that s one thing about third base , said rodriguez , who converted from shortstop last spring you do n't have a lot of options on how to make plays i'm still a little new at the position and trying to figure out a sort of creative way to make a play i thought the best way against johnny was to be aggressive i 've always thought that if i'm going to make an error , i 'd rather be aggressive than passive rodriguez has not done much at the plate so far , with a homer , seven singles and a 267 average but several yankees are doing much worse , notably giambi , whose solo homer last saturday is his only run batted in giambi , tino martinez and bernie williams are batting a combined 158 \( 9 for 57 \) it is hard to win with production like that , and hard to look very lively during losses rodriguez said the yankees had been a little flat the last two days , and manager joe torre , who canceled a workout on tuesday s day off , seemed to agree it s tough to look good when you get beat up , he said monday we did n't make plays , they got some base hits , and we 're on our heels jaret wright , who was shelled by the orioles last week , will start against schilling , with randy johnson making his third start thursday then come the orioles at camden yards this weekend if the yankees win the next two games , they will suddenly be hot if they lose them , their season might seem to be on the brink of disaster it is the nature of new york baseball in april , and in the clubhouse on monday , general manager brian cashman tried to offer perspective one week it s not judgeable , cashman said i could say we 're playing poorly that s easy to say , because we have n't played well but i have n't focused on anything we 've started out on a little bit of a bad stretch there s nothing more than that to say
kapalua , hawaii , jan 7 none of the players chasing vijay singh at the mercedes championships sounded ready to concede him the trophy not mike weir , who shot a 10underpar 63 on friday , one stroke off the plantation course record not ernie els , a former winner of the event , who was three strokes off the lead not tiger woods , who could not make a putt longer than six feet most of the day , but was five strokes back if singh wants to pick up in 2005 where he left off in 2004 , he will have to hold off some of golf s biggest names heading into saturday s third round , singh was 15 under par for the tournament \( 131 , 6665 \) , two strokes ahead of weir \( 133 , 7063 \) , three strokes ahead of els \( 134 , 6965 \) , and four strokes ahead of sergio garc a \( 135 , 6867 \) and jonathan kaye \( 135 , 6867 \) woods , who shot 68 s in the first two rounds , was in a threeway tie for sixth place at 10 under par with chad campbell and stewart cink the expectation heading into the season was that many players , not just singh , were poised to have terrific seasons and els , one of the players looking to lead the pack in 2005 , was eager for the weekend s possibilities he s playing great golf , let s not get that wrong , els said of singh but it s a long year we can all play this game i get my act together , you know , it will be game on , and the same with tiger , and the same with other people i think it s great for the game of golf there s a lot of challengers now for the no 1 spot i think it s much better for the game now than it was five years ago , when tiger was so far ahead of us woods probably liked it better before unless his putting improves , he will not win this tournament , and on friday his frustration on the greens was obvious woods missed five putts inside of eight feet on the 18th hole , he missed a fourfooter for birdie , and he appeared to break his normal routine , standing over the putt frozen like a statue , before finally striking it and missing the greens at the plantation course are slower than normal , and the change made woods uncomfortable everyone has to deal with it , woods said we 've never putted them this slow before , and you 've just got to make the adjustment i 've been having a difficult time making the adjustment nothing seems to bother singh golf is not as easy as singh makes it look but every part of his game seems to be at top level his driving , his iron play , his short game , his putting , his course management and his confidence singh has not run away from the fields the way woods did during his dominant days , but his consistency is unmatched , and his ability to close tournaments has been proved many times singh set the tone for the round friday by shooting a 30 on the front nine , and he said he liked his chances holding a twostroke lead i'm looking forward to it , i'm playing well , i'm putting well , singh said stuart appleby \( eight under par \) , the defending champion , set the tone for friday s low scoring , shooting a 64 playing in the day s second group appleby is already excited about 2005 , with his wife , ashley , expecting the couple s first child next week considering the strength at the top of the leader board , appleby will have a difficult time repeating as champion but at least his superb round friday , featuring nine birdies and no bogeys , gave appleby a chance i made a lot of nice putts , and you do n't shoot that score and miss a ton , said appleby , a fivetime winner on tour who bounced back after struggling in the opening round it was just a day when i hit the ball well weir shot one stroke lower than appleby , and almost equaled the course record of 62 set by kj choi in 2003 but to beat singh , weir knew he might have to shoot even lower than he did on friday looks like he s swinging it well , and working harder than ever , weir said of singh he shows no sign of slowing down it s just a given he s going to be there chip shots the field for next week s sony open in hawaii was announced friday , and dean wilson , a native of hawaii , was not given a sponsor exemption by the tournament that angered mike weir , a college teammate of wilson s at brigham young dean is the only player on tour from hawaii , weir said for him not to get into the sony open in year s past , let alone now when he s a tour member , is a bit embarrassing for the tournament , quite frankly you 've got to support your local guy
the waltz does n't get a great deal of attention these days pianists perform them in small groups typically , and orchestras trot them out for new year s eve concerts there is probably a reason , perhaps that the inherent sway in the triple meter dance can get to sound soupy after a while , no matter how lyrical the writing or lively the playing still , the canadian pianist louis lortie devoted an entire recital to the waltz on saturday evening at carnegie hall , and through inventive selections , consistently thoughtful interpretive turns and , not least , a good deal of dazzling finger power , he made the concept seem inspired one thing mr lortie did was keep off the beaten path , at least on the first part of the program a listener might , for example , have expected a generous helping of chopin , a firstclass waltz writer , and one of mr lortie s specialties but there was none instead , mr lortie opened his program with schubert , a composer not known principally for his waltzes , but the author of some lovely ones all the same in selections from the valses nobles \( d 969 \) and valses sentimentales \( d 779 \) , mr lortie played with an inviting suppleness but also with power when schubert s graceful lyricism gave way to more heated passages nor are waltzes the first works that come to mind when liszt s name is mentioned , but they were hardly foreign to him , particularly if they were written by other composers first mr lortie offered lizst s soir es de vienne no 6 , a work based on schubert s waltzes , as well as liszt s transcription of the ballroom scene from berlioz s symphonie fantastique , and his paraphrase of the waltz from gounod s faust mr lortie s accounts suggested the nostalgic charm that liszt found in schubert , as well as in both of the berlioz and gounod originals , and the pianistic ingenuity of liszt s arrangements but he was at his best in two of liszt s own waltzes , the first two of the four valses oubli es in these , his touch was at its most seductively fluid , particularly in the pianissimo rippling treble writing that ends the second waltz after the intermission mr lortie took a brief excursion into modern times , with helmut lachenmann s variations on a theme of schubert , a sometimes lyrical , sometimes spiky work from the mid1950 s , that mr lortie played energetically and with an admirable clarity of texture and gesture he ended the concert with robust , colorful performances of ravel s two famous waltzes , the valses nobles et sentimentales which in name , if not in spirit , look back to the schubert scores that opened the program and the splashy la valse
the souschef from capitale , a fashionable banquet hall in chinatown , will serve up seared tuna with mango and a shallot vin cotto reduction vip service will abound , lights will flash at a new discoth que and topshelf spirits will flow freely all this and more will come together this fall at the vicinity of eighth avenue and 42nd street , which some may recall as the address of the port authority bus terminal specifically , the grand plans focus on the bus terminal s bowling alley , which is just past the gates for buses to tenafly and teaneck introducing the new leisure time bowl even the bowling shoes will be replaced with shinier models as leisure time completes its overhaul in september , which will transform a midtown secret into an entertainment complex in addition to the disco , the complex will have two restaurants , a business meeting area , two upscale arcades , a new bar and a private vip bowling area with bottle service and personal wait staff you do n't associate these images with bowling centers in new york , or in america , for that matter , said john ryan , the lanes' general manager the renovations will be directed by big bowl , a danish company that bought leisure time just over a year ago and is investing 10 million in the project having successfully opened similar facilities in places like malm , sweden , and taastrup , denmark , the company hopes to make leisure time the pilot model for a crop of bowling centers nationwide the idea is to be a onestop shop for an evening out , said mr ryan , who recently brought towering 192ounce glass beer steins from denmark in which customers can now order their beer of choice he said that leisure time would get a new name , but for now , it is secret for the moment , most evenings at leisure time are calm , though the place occasionally gets busy enough to generate a wait for one of its 30 lanes on a visit on tuesday , attendance was low at the center s unlimited beer and bowling hour \( price 17 \) , when young men in track jackets picked up spares a few lanes down from senior citizens in airbrushed bowling usa tshirts just outside leisure time s entrance in the south wing of the port authority , there was even less glamour bored shoeshine men ate sandwiches in foil wrappers , commuters scurried to their gates and tourists searched in vain for the a train , none of them knowing of the glitter that was on its way jeff vandam
hikkaduwa , sri lanka , monday , jan 3 to drive just a mile from the shore where a tsunami came roaring in a week ago is to feel the calm apart from the storm the coast is a tableau of battered boats , smashed hotels and residents scooping mud from what is left of their homes the immediate interior of the country and its residents show not a scratch that surreal contrast , economists say , helps explain the perverse likelihood that one of the world s largest human disasters may have a relatively marginal economic impact in the economies of sri lanka , indonesia , india , thailand and the other affected countries , the tsunami is likely to register more as a small wave , because the two industries most heavily hit tourism and fishing make up small percentages of the overall economy it is in individual lives , as well as the countries' infrastructures , that the true cost will be felt like many other fishermen , w lasanthe has known only the sea mr lasanthe , 31 , who lives in beruwala , sri lanka , bought his 18foot boat two years ago for 2 , 500 with the help of a bank loan he is still paying off now the boat is gone but even if he had a boat , he said , nobody wants fish now not from a sea that swallowed so many dead bodies no job , he said glumly , and no plan economists agree that it is the poor who will suffer , rather than the overall economy it is mostly a human impact we are feeling at the moment , said jgt sundaram of the board of investment , a government agency that promotes sri lankan business opportunities to foreigners wing thye woo , a professor of economics at the university of california , davis , said , it s a blip , but a blip that is concentrated among the poorest of the population even as it has destroyed the livelihoods of millions of families in south asia , the tsunami will shave only a few points off the region s economic growth this year depending on the importance of tourism in each country , the decrease is expected to range from less than 1 percent for thailand to 2 percent for sri lanka and 4 percent for the maldives , according to estimates by standard chartered bank aceh , which bore the brunt of the tsunami damage in indonesia , accounts for only 2 percent of indonesia s economy the tsunami apparently did not damage the region s most lucrative properties , oil and gas production facilities most of aceh s population depend on agriculture for their livelihood rice , peanuts , soybeans , maize , cassava and potatoes it is unclear how much agricultural land was flooded by the tsunami sri lanka s economy , which grew an estimated 5 percent in 2004 , is still heavily agricultural , with tea , rubber and coconuts the major exports in recent years , money sent home by one million sri lankan migrant workers in the middle east most of them women employed as housemaids has become the country s largest net foreign exchange earner , one especially appealing to the government because it is not affected by tsunamis or other acts of nature garment factories that supply stores like victoria s secret also employ , directly and indirectly , close to one million people none have been affected by the tsunami tourism and fishing together make up less than 6 percent of sri lanka s gross domestic product thailand s economy is expected to grow about 6 percent in 2005 , about the same as in 2004 tourism in southern thailand around phuket , the only part of the country affected , accounts for about 13 percent of the national economy already , much of the phuket tourism has been rerouted to other thai resort towns , and the damaged beach towns could well see a construction boom as up to 2 billion is expected to be invested to rebuild beachfront hotels , homes and shops but peter harrold , the world bank s country director for sri lanka , cautioned against using gross domestic product as the only measurement of the economic impact of the disaster the loss was huge in houses , boats , ports , hotels , clinics , roads and railways , he pointed out , and all will have to be rebuilt overnight , a huge capital stock was wiped away , he said most affected businesses and individuals along the rim of the indian ocean do not have insurance coverage for the kind of disaster they encountered a week ago how much , or even whether , they will be compensated by their governments or through outside aid remains unclear at the ocean plaza shopping center in phuket , the mass of water destroyed the jewelry store , the thai arts shop , the shoe store and the chester s grilled chicken outlet in the basement , the big one supermarket is still filled with water and bobbing debris a reminder of the 30 tourists who drowned there the insurance company does not want to pay , so they have not even come to inspect , said suthep prabtook , the supermarket s general manager they say they pay for normal water damage , but this was water damage caused by an earthquake the fishermen of sri lanka do not have insurance at all prasantha desilva , whose family owns the five largest fishing boats in beruwala harbor , said the insurance premiums had been too expensive now , with four of their boats , which cost about 150 , 000 each , wrecked , they must start from scratch we are very badly affected i do n't think we can stand up , he said these are our major properties each boat the longest is 60 feet employs 25 or 30 people , from fishermen to helpers that means that until mr desilva gets new boats , more than 100 people have lost their livelihoods all told , the 100 big boats damaged in the harbor employ more than 3 , 000 people , he said sri lanka harvests 300 , 000 tons of fish a year , most of it for domestic consumption , and much of it is caught by subsistence fishermen who own small 18foot boats or catamarans in beruwala , more than 1 , 000 catamarans are gone , with the numbers even higher in the hardesthit areas like galle the tsunami struck during the winter tourist season , whose peak extends from december through february sri lanka looked to tourism as a major area of growth tourism grew 111 percent in the first 10 months of 2004 compared with same period last year november brought a recordbreaking flow of tourists , according to the board of investment , with 64 , 971 arrivals , pushing the total for the year above 500 , 000 hundreds of hotels were damaged or destroyed , though most of the largest and most expensive ones are largely intact hotels that were full when the tsunami struck are now running at 50 percent or less occupancy no one knows how long tourists will stay away , and along with hotels , road and rail links to the south will also have to be rebuilt before the tourism industry can recover gamani senanaiyake , 54 , the owner of mama s beach hotel here , where dozens of small hotels and 75 flatbottom boats were wiped out , predicted that tourists would not return for at least six months they have to , he said that is our main income the currencies and stock markets of thailand , malaysia and sri lanka did not move significantly last week indonesia s jakarta composite index rose tuesday and wednesday but fell slightly on thursday some analysts say the markets may rise on the news of the large aid commitments made to indonesia over the new year s holiday weekend other economic impacts across the region may take time to become evident a rapprochement between separatists in aceh and the indonesian government in jakarta could mean more investment to develop the riches of aceh many economists predict a surge in the construction industry and the production of raw materials , like cement and steel , that supply it but an influx of aid money and aid workers to help with longterm reconstruction could push prices up , as has happened in places like afghanistan rohan chamindar , 26 , is a lifeguard , not an economist , but he has his own prediction of how the tsunami will shape the sri lankan economy the disaster , he said , was likely to propel even more women and men like him to migrate to the middle east for work what choice did he have , he asked his house was flattened , and the tourist season , when he made most of his money working at a hotel near colombo , was cut short there is no work in sri lanka that could pay as well as his hotel job had , or , barring very specific government aid , provide enough income to finance the rebuilding of homes if i work in sri lanka , i cannot earn enough , he said so the tsunami , he predicted , will have an economic impact in the middle east , too they will lower the salary scale , he said , because after the disaster , so many sri lankans are looking for overseas jobs
of the cast of characters in the threemonthold decision to search bags and packages brought into the new york city subways , it now appears that the most striking is richard a clarke mr clarke , a former counterterrorism adviser to two presidents , received widespread attention last year for his criticism of president bush s response to the sept 11 attacks , detailed in a searing memoir and in security testimony before the 9 11 commission unknown to the public , until recently , was mr clarke s role in advising new york city officials in helping to devise the container inspection program that the police department began in july after two attacks on the transit system in london obviously you want to catch people with bombs on their back , but there is a value to a program that does n't stop everyone and is n't compulsory , he said in a deposition mr clarke later added , the goal here is to impart to the terrorists a sense that there is an enhanced security program , to deter them from going into the new york subway and choosing that as a target the involvement of mr clarke whom police commissioner raymond w kelly s top deputies consulted repeatedly in july is an indication of the degree to which the bagsearch policy has attracted national attention a legal challenge to the policy , filed by the new york civil liberties union and heard by a federal judge in manhattan last week , is seen as a test case of the proper scope of governmental intervention in the lives of citizens in the name of deterring a terrorist attack judge richard m berman will decide the case next month at the earliest , but already each side says it is prepared to appeal if it loses the heart of the case is the civil liberties union s assertion that the searches violate the fourth amendment s guarantee against unreasonable searches and seizures to be reasonable , a search ordinarily must be based on suspicion of individual wrongdoing , but the courts have long recognized an important exception administrative searches justified by special needs beyond normal law enforcement christopher dunn , associate legal director of the civil liberties group , argued that the way the searches were carried out made it certain that only innocent riders were inspected only a tiny number of search checkpoints , if any , are set up on any day , and the vast majority of stations are unprotected most of the time anyone selected for a search can choose to refuse and leave gail donoghue , the city s lead lawyer in the case , presented experts , like mr clarke , who insisted that the searches were an effective deterrent by making the subway system a less predictable target the experts did not deny that the searches were limited mostly to the commuter rush and were hardly comprehensive , but david cohen , the deputy police commissioner for intelligence and a veteran of the central intelligence agency , defended the searches by saying more is better than some , and some is better than none mr clarke , who was expected to be a star witness for the city , gave a deposition last month rather than come to court , lawyers said , because he was promoting his novel last week in that deposition , mr clarke conceded under crossexamination by mr dunn that the paucity of searches might play a role in a terrorist s calculation of the likelihood of being stopped if they were a de minimis number so that the terrorists might think that the chances of having it were extremely remote , perhaps they would be less deterred , mr clarke said but again , they would have to know that neither he nor the lawyers on either side could or would say what that minimal number might be , although judge berman pressed the question at several points during the twoday trial the city views the searches , which typically last just a few seconds , as minimally intrusive the civil liberties union believes the searches are deeply intrusive both sides have pointed to supreme court precedents to support their case the city has referred to michigan v sitz , an often cited 1990 decision that upheld the legality of sobriety checkpoints in which a consistent proportion of drivers was stopped the court ruled that such roadblocks were permitted as a way to prevent drunken driving the civil liberties union has cited bond v united states , a 2000 decision that found unconstitutional a search in which a border patrol agent squeezed the soft luggage that a passenger had placed in the overhead storage space on a bus the court found that the defendant possessed a privacy interest in his bag , in which a package of methamphetamine had been found judge berman may end up having to decide whether the subway searches are more like a sobriety checkpoint or a luggage search on a bus whether routine but infrequent searches really can deter terrorism and whether a bag search is merely a passing nuisance or a surrender of privacy
there are many reasons to envy new york restaurant chefs these days , from the kitchen gadgetry at their disposal to their likelihood of receiving major publishing contracts i for one covet their commutes to arrive at his new restaurant , perry st , in the west village , jeangeorges vongerichten takes neither subway nor bus , taxi nor limousine he travels via elevator , from the seventh floor of the condominium building in which he lives to the first daniel boulud can use the stairs his apartment is just one floor up from his flagship restaurant , daniel , on the upper east side and so can scott and heather fratangelo , who live smack above their restaurant , spigolo , also on the upper east side for the fratangelos , deciding how to get to work simply means choosing a pair of shoes they can match their mode of transportation to the rest of their outfits this arrangement does n't allow them much of a sense of separation between home and work but it lets the fratangelos , both 30 years old , dote on and fret over spigolo , which has only about 25 seats and a half dozen bar stools both the degree and nature of their attentiveness show spigolo , which serves unpretentious italian food in an uncontrived setting , feels unusually honest and earnest and it feels that way from the moment you walk through the door oh , yes , hello ! said heather fratangelo , who plays the role of hostess as well as pastry chef , on a warm sunday evening in early july , when the loss of neighborhood residents to distant beaches was still evident on the becalmed sidewalks and streets her exuberant manner of greeting me had nothing to do with desperation despite the weekend exodus , spigolo was full and the tone of familiarity in her voice suggested we had met many times before we had in fact met only once , and that was 10 minutes earlier , when i had glanced briefly into the restaurant to see if my guests were there but in spigolo s intensely hospitable world , that glance was enough to make me a veritable regular , and a summery lavender outfit worn by one of my guests , who trailed after me , was enough to prompt additional endearments that s such a pretty dress , ms fratangelo said if she did n't really mean it , cherry jones better watch out there s an even better actress in town while ms fratangelo supervises the dining room , mr fratangelo minds the kitchen , and does so with a similar grace and confidence although he is young and spigolo is his first chance to run his own show , he does n't make the mistakes of flamboyant inventiveness and annoyingly cheeky conceits the menu follows an instantly recognizable contemporary italian layout salumi and uncooked seafood in the prologue , followed by separate chapters of appetizers , pasta dishes and main courses , and then of course dessert , which is when his wife s hugely pleasing culinary efforts come into play it s possible to take an unpersuasive journey through this narrative , because spigolo s dishes are n't uniformly terrific i recall an excessively sauced saltimboccalike breast of veal , a somewhat dry red snapper , and a loin of lamb sliced into such thin ribbons that it surrendered much of its meaty appeal , becoming something daintier and droopier in the process i remember an insufficiently thick risotto that came close to impersonating soup \( and not even bisque at that \) but more many more of my memories of spigolo are extremely fond ones mr fratangelo excels at seafood and has put a grill in his kitchen that enables him to cook it over charcoal , which puts a distinctive stamp on it during my visits , the terrific results included appetizers of plump jumbo shrimp and of tiny baby octopuses , the latter rendered especially pliant and zesty by a pregrill braising in white wine and chili peppers and a subsequent bath in preserved lemons , lemon juice and olive oil also grilled and also firstrate was a fairly straightforward salmon fillet , which was given robust accompaniment charred corn , a mixture of oyster and shiitake mushrooms , and pea shoots mr fratangelo tends to cover his plates with many vegetables and herbs in different colors and shapes these supporting players are at once pedestals , skirts and side dishes , and he does n't mold them into geometric wonders , because his purpose is n't showmanship what he s clearly after is a sense of bounty and a bevy of familiar , comforting flavors and he achieved precisely that with a main course of panroasted wild striped bass the fish was just about as succulent and satisfying as it could be , and had a contrasting layer of crisp skin atop it below and around it were tomatoes , eggplant , red onion , brined capers , olives , pine nuts and more a caponata that brought the mediterranean sharply to mind mr fratangelo also has a few terrific pasta dishes up his sleeve he makes his own fettuccine , adding lemon zest to the dough , and serves it in a bracing pesto that blends arugula with basil but edits out nuts and cheese he does n't make his own garganelli , but no matter the noodles he buys are combined with a sweet fennel sausage rag and parmesan cheese to delightful effect given all these options , it would be easy for a diner to fill up before dessert it would also be foolish while none of ms fratangelo s creations were blazingly original , almost all were irresistible , including a caramel affogato with sugary doughnuts and a mixed berry cobbler with vanilla gelato spigolo means edge or corner , and the cornerlot theater for this feast seems , at first glance , just about perfect exposed brick walls that create a rustic aura , handsome glass doors that let in streams of light but the hard surfaces translate into the kind of earsplitting noise you usually associate with a bigger , slicker , less intimate restaurant the fratangelos have hired an acoustic consultant to help them find a solution to this problem , which could easily deter diners and possibly annoy the neighbors lucky for the fratangelos , they need n't worry about complaints from the apartment closest to spigolo if the restaurant is at full tilt , that residence is empty spigolo

winning the oscar for titanic , who knew that he also had designs on the rest of the solar system \? his newest film , aliens of the deep , is a grandiose hybrid of undersea documentary and outerspace fantasy that begins on our planet s ocean floor and ends many miles under the ice crust that covers europa , the second moon of jupiter the movie s sneaky transition from undersea documentary to speculative fantasy of a journey yet to be undertaken is so seamless that you could easily mistake the last portion of the film for the record of an actual space voyage mr cameron s theory , supported by astrobiologists , is that the life forms found at the deepest levels of the ocean where no light from the sun penetrates may hold clues to the nature of possible life in outer space filmed in imax 3d , it is a visual adventure worthy of that muchdegraded adjective , awesome stephen holden 'assisted living' starring michael bonsignore and maggie riley directed by elliot greenebaum \( no rating , 77 minutes \) as nursing homes go , meadow view , the site of this hardheaded comedy that feels like a documentary , is a far cry from the hellholes we sometimes read about , where the elderly are dumped and treated like prisoners the rooms are clean and the staff efficient life there is viewed through the institution s scruffy 27yearold janitor \( mr bonsignore \) who regularly sneaks off to smoke pot , is careless about punctuality , and plays affectionate pranks on the residents to relieve his boredom the wisp of a plot follows todd s relationship with a patient \( ms riley \) suffering

scorsese \( pg13 , 169 minutes \) the famously eccentric and reclusive empire builder howard hughes was born alone and died alone two times when he was no different from anyone else for the rest of his life , the highflying hughes seemed to have drifted in from some distant aerie , where exotic birds hatch far from everyday worries at the age of 18 , he was both an orphan and a millionaire , and while he could never be called ordinary , in the following two decades his wealth and all that it afforded brought him a very american kind of celebrity it is that celebrity , fueled by money , stoked by matinee looks and playboy style , that preoccupies the aviator , mr scorsese s visually sumptuous if disappointingly hollow account of hughes s early life written by john logan , the story principally covers the late 20 s through the 40 s , when hughes , played by mr dicaprio , was gadding about both hollywood and the aviation world manohla dargis 'boogeyman' starring barry watson

starring samuel l jackson , rob brown , robert ri'chard , rick gonzalez , nana gbewonyo and antwon tanner directed by thomas carter \( pg13 , 137 minutes \) in this solid , unsurprising inspirationalcoach drama , mr jackson plays ken carter , who returns to his old high school in the tough northern california city of richmond to turn a squad of underachieving misfits into winners , both on and off the court based on a true story , the movie combines sportspicture suspense with heroiceducator uplift when carter , dismayed that his players are slipping academically , padlocks the gym in the midst of an undefeated season mr carter \( the director , not related to the coach \) infuses this sentimental warhorse with some flourishes of realism , which are bolstered by the hiphop soundtrack and by the performances of the younger cast members , especially mr brown as a talented forward struggling with his responsibilities , ashanti as his girlfriend , and mr gonzalez as a player sliding toward a life of crime ao scott 'headon' starring birol unel , sibel kekilli , catrin striebeck and guven kirac directed by fatih akin \( not rated , 118 minutes \) in german and turkish , with english subtitles love does n't just hurt in the jagged german romance headon it cuts and bleeds and even kills a story about a lonely man and a stilllonelier woman fighting against their worlds and what often seems like their own best interests , the film has caused a stir in germany for the murky , troubling light it sheds on the lives of the country s turkish immigrants its popularity made it a fleeting social phenomenon and a minor cultural footnote but it does n't explain why this film about two strangers with suicidal tendencies and a deep commitment to selfaggrandizing drama is the first very good movie of this very young year one of the truisms about romances , even those shaded pitch black and set to banging rock music , is that you have to fall in love with the characters when they 're falling for each other it takes a long time for cahit \( mr unel \) and sibel \( ms kekilli \) to get inside each other s heads , much less anywhere else , but it does n't take us long to care about these two perfectly imperfect beings dargis 'hide and seek' starring robert de niro , dakota fanning , famke janssen , elisabeth shue , amy irving , dylan

emily move to the country for some healing once there , things go from lousy to worse , as emily starts staring blankly into the surrounding woods and palling around with a sinister invisible friend called charlie blood drips into the story then it pours one of the most gifted child actors around , ms fanning has both chops and a preternaturally intense screen presence even when you do n't believe the setup , you buy what she is selling that s a good thing when it comes to this horrorthriller hybrid , which was written by ari schlossberg and needs all the help it can get from its actors dargis 'hotel rwanda' starring don cheadle , sophie okonedo , joaquin phoenix and nick nolte directed by terry george \( pg13 , 121 minutes \) this wrenching political thriller , based on fact , performs the valuable service of lending a human face to an upheaval so savage that it seemed beyond the realm of imagination when news of it filtered into the west the movie certainly is n't the first screen depiction of a nation consumed in ethnic strife but its vision of the slaughter of 800 , 000 tutsis by the ruling hutu tribe in rwanda during a hundredday bloodbath in 1994 offers a devastating picture of mediadriven mass murder left unchecked the story is based on the reallife experiences of paul rusesabagina \( mr cheadle \) , the softspoken hutu manager of the hotel des mille collines , in kigali , who with his tutsi wife , tatiana \( ms okonedo \) , and children , narrowly escapes death several times mr rusesabagina was directly responsible for saving the lives of more than 1 , 200 tutsis and hutu moderates by sheltering them in the hotel and bribing the hutu military to spare them the movie , which is squeamish about showing the full extent of savagery , hammers every button on the emotional console holden 'in good company' starring dennis quaid , topher grace and scarlett johansson written and directed by paul weitz \( pg13 , 106 minutes \) this gently revisionist fairy tale about good versus evil is set on the battlefield of contemporary corporate culture , a site of our leading blood sport mostly , though , the movie is about men the two men at the story s engaging center are carter duryea \( mr grace \) , a young executive who has been promoted beyond his abilities to run the advertising department of a magazine with the resonant name of sports america the man whom carter is meant to make redundant is the 51yearold dan foreman , a ruggedly appealing adult who brings out the best in everyone dan has a pictureperfect family and is the kind of unabashedly oldfashioned masculine type that mr quaid has been slowcooking to perfection over the years and which , on american screens at least , has lately gone missing dargis 'lost embrace' starring daniel hendler directed by daniel burman \( not rated , 100 minutes in spanish , with english subtitles \) set in a shabby buenos aires shopping mall , this antic , melancholy comedy gives a latin american twist to a story of young , male jewish identity crisis that will be familiar to fans of philip roth , neil simon and woody allen ariel \( the fastmoving , nervouslooking mr hendler \) is a young man in a hurry , without much of a sense of direction he carries on an anxious affair with an older woman , pines for his former girlfriend , and fantasizes about emigrating to poland , from which his family fled two generations before mostly , though , he is haunted by the absence of his father , elias , who abandoned him as a baby to go to israel to fight in the 1973 war the film , while busy and diffuse , is also touching and funny , and its modesty and haphazardness are among its charms scott 'meet the fockers' starring robert de niro , ben stiller , dustin hoffman , barbra streisand , blythe danner , teri polo and owen wilson directed by jay roach \( pg13 , 114 minutes \) like meet the parents , the followup new comedy meet the fockers hinges on the welltraveled idea that there s something comic about being jewish in america not the philip roth , takenoprisoners funny , in which jewish identity is good , bad , happy , sad , a historical chip on the shoulder , a sign of radical difference rather , the postborscht belt funny of the genial sitcom jew whose difference is amorphous enough to be thoroughly unthreatening the jew as an ethnic accessory that nonjews on both sides of the camera can enjoy without anxiety , like the cute cabala string madonna likes to wear and so , just as bernie loved bridget , and rhoda loved mary , so does greg focker \( mr stiller \) love pam byrnes \( ms polo \) and because greg loves pam , pam s father , jack \( mr de niro \) , does n't love greg not because no man could ever be good enough for his daughter , but because greg does n't look like pam s old squeeze , the fairhaired kevin \( mr wilson \) dargis 'the merchant of venice' starring al pacino , jeremy irons , joseph fiennes and lynn collins directed by michael radford \( r , 127 minutes \) shakespeare s most problematic play at least with respect to modern sensitivities receives an intelligent interpretation from mr radford and a superb cast mr pacino , showing welcome restraint after a series of overdone stage and screen performances , emphasizes shylock s grief and estrangement , turning him into a fragile monster but his villainy , however much it smacks of blood libel , cannot be discarded without compromising the play s complex ideas about justice and duty , and mr radford does not try to wash away the stain of antisemitism that is woven into the heart of his source he does remind us how much more is going on in the play , and along with his talented production designer and cinematographer , he renders venice as a series of renaissance paintings tableaus that in evoking vel \? uez , rembrandt , titian and vermeer immerse us in the ferment of early modern europe mr irons is quietly mesmerizing in the title role , a creature of mysterious melancholy whose soul seems at once pure and rotted the movie really belongs to ms collins , who gives portia her rightful wit and charisma , and makes her the play s cruel and lovely moral center scott 'million dollar baby' starring clint eastwood , hilary swank and morgan freeman directed by mr eastwood \( pg13 , 135 minutes \) mr eastwood takes what appears to be a conventional boxingmelodrama plot about a crusty old trainer whose heart is melted by a spirited young fighter and turns it into a glowing , somber meditation on friendship , ambition and death the picture s scale is small , and its pacing leisurely , which gives you a chance to savor three lovely performances from ms swank as the young boxer , mr freeman as a worldweary former contender and mr eastwood as the trainer , frankie dunn at 74 , mr eastwood has achieved a level of mastery that leaves him with nothing to prove , and so , unafraid of sentiment and willing to risk clich \? he has made a graceful , lyrical , devastating masterpiece the best film released by a major hollywood studio in 2004 scott 'nobody knows' starring yuya yagira directed by hirokazu koreeda \( pg13 , 141 minutes in japanese , with english subtitles \) based on the true story of four children abandoned by their mother in a small tokyo apartment , mr koreeda s fourth film is at once harrowing and tender , an urban horror story with overtones of fairy tale restricting himself to the children s point of view , the director creates an almost unbearable sense of dread in the audience you ca n't help suspecting that , at every moment , something terrible is about to happen but at the same time , because the children themselves do not perceive the full terribleness of their situation , the terror is mitigated by a sense of wonder and adventure the keys to this meticulous and deeply humane film are mr koreeda s deft camera sense and the remarkable performance of the 12yearold mr yagira as akira , the oldest of the four siblings , who must somehow preserve his own innocence while protecting his more vulnerable brother and sisters scott 'a very long engagement' starring audrey tautou , gaspard ulliel , jeanpierre becker , dominique bettenfeld , clovis cornillac and marion cotillard directed by jeanpierre jeunet \( r , 133 minutes in french , with english subtitles \) if you like battleground carnage delivered with aesthetic brio , the kind that ensures that when a soldier explodes into confetti , his flesh will dapple a trenchmate as decoratively as pink rosettes on a cake , this new french film will serve you nicely set during world war i and its immediate aftermath , and directed by the cult favorite jeanpierre jeunet , it follows the adventures of a young woman , mathilde \( ms tautou \) , who holds fast to the hope that her young soldier fianc \? ill return home from his apparent grave even when death seems to part them , the cord of her love remains unbroken best known for am \? e , a modern fairy tale also starring ms tautou , mr jeunet possesses a distinctive visual style that s part rube goldberg , part fao schwarz , and generally enjoyable for about 15 minutes dargis 'the wedding date' starring debra messing and dermot mulroney directed by clare kilner \( pg13 , 90 minutes \) either ms kilner or dana fox , her screenwriter , must have adored four weddings and a funeral , because their new romantic comedy struggles from beginning to end to capture that earlier film s charm and ebullience their efforts are largely unsuccessful ms messing stars as kat ellis , a new yorker en route to london for her younger halfsister s wedding since there is no man in kat s life , she turns to the classified ads for male escorts in a fantasy worthy of pretty woman , the male prostitute she hires turns out to be a hunk \( mr mulroney \) with beautiful manners and a degree in comparative literature from brown both stars are highly appealing , despite a shaky script with aphorisms that do n't quite deliver after rowdy parties in london , everyone heads for the glorious english countryside for familybonding activities the wedding date proves that there is nothing inherently magical about a group of adults frolicking on a lawn with an old popmusic hit in the background what charms it does have would be far more enjoyable if the movie were n't so in love with its own supposed cuteness gates 'the woodsman' starring kevin bacon directed by nicole kassell \( r , 87 minutes \) ms kassell directs this story of a paroled child molester struggling to reenter society after 12 years in prison in a lean , unassuming style , which suits the subject matter and gives the fine cast room to explore their complicated , unhappy characters the story is not always plausible , and the atmosphere sometimes feels programmatically grim , but the film is a serious , compassionate attempt at psychological realism , anchored by mr bacon s precise , unsettling performance as a man trying to untangle his decent impulses from his destructive , predatory urges scott pop a selective listing by critics of the times new or noteworthy rock and pop

last month , brazil s environmental officials announced that the burning of the amazon has slowed deforestation this year is half of what it was the year before this news shows that when brazil s government musters the political will to protect the amazon , it can do it large swaths of the jungle are still disappearing , mainly set on fire by soybean farmers and ranchers looking for land to raise cattle last year was the worst for amazon deforestation in a decade the health of the amazon is a global concern because the forest soaks up greenhouse gases , which lessens global warming deforestation means the amazon could eventually become too small to produce the rain that it needs to survive deforestation is also deadly for millions of amazon peasants trying to eke out a living growing small plots or collecting forest products land grabbers snatch up valuable property near planned paved roads , burning the villages to drive the inhabitants away hundreds of leaders who have tried to speak up for peasants have been murdered , and virtually none of the killers ever face jail unfortunately , part of the reason farmers and ranchers cleared less jungle this year is because the price of soybeans and beef have dropped , and brazil s currency is stronger so exports are less profitable but the government s commitment to protecting the amazon has also been important led by marina silva , the environment minister and once a poor amazon rubber tapper herself , brazil is starting to impose its authority in parts of the forest that have always been lawless in the state of par in february , gunmen killed dorothy stang , an american nun who had worked with the rural poor for 30 years after the murder , the government sent 2 , 000 federal troops to the zone and announced a logging ban on millions of acres of amazon land the government has also begun to enforce its laws it is beginning to require real documentation of claims for land title in june , police arrested dozens of members of an illegal clearcutting ring finally , through new satellite imaging , brazilian authorities can spot burning while it is happening and theoretically make arrests rule of law is still foreign to the amazon but it is becoming a little less so
fred wilson black like me , at the aldrich contemporary art museum , is the 2002 larry aldrich foundation award exhibition that it has taken mr wilson , a new york city artist , a few years to fulfill his obligation to the museum notwithstanding the year the aldrich was closed for renovations speaks to the limitations of the present offering it looks to me as if the exhibition was assembled hurriedly out of commercial stock from the artist s studio none of this is to cast aspersions on the artist , for mr wilson is smart , diligent and professional it is rather that , put together as an exhibition , the works just do n't make sense with its provocative title taken from the book written in 1961 by the civilrights advocate john howard griffin the expectation is of some felt political statement about the black experience but there is nothing terribly deep or profound here the bulk of the show is a display of mr wilson s most recent glass works he likes to work with black glass , producing drippy viscous blobs and wall objects that look a bit like candy , tears or tadpoles but the sensual shapes , fluid sensibility and cool opacity suggest the pleasures of indulgent aestheticism , rather than , to quote the news release , an exploration of racial and ethnic marginalization pleasureseeking aestheticism can also harbor something profound , as matisse proved , but mr wilson seems to have too openly embraced the decorative he is having fun , showing off what he can do with this material from making glass raindrops and puddles to eyetricking installations of flat disks curving inward and how to explain the beady eyes stuck onto the ends of glass tears \? they look kitsch then again , the idea of plump black faces and big white eyes sort of reminds you of black minstrels from the 1920 s and 1930 s but it is such a hackneyed reference to race and racial politics in american society a society immensely changed since those decades that you have to wonder whether mr wilson , who is africanamerican , is thinking independently or just capitalizing on a notorious threadbare clich \? or the sake of creative expediency in addition to the black glass sculptures , the exhibition includes new and old works opening the exhibition is black memory \( 2005 \) , a wooden vitrine filled with ink bottles and oil cans the bottles and cans evoke the viscosity of the black glass in the next room , i guess , but beyond that , i do n't get the connection what about the title of this piece \? perhaps the artist is giving himself over to a new , unformed idea and making himself vulnerable in so doing this is courageous , if frustrating for viewers the exhibition s final room contains two works displayed together as if one a black dressing table placed in front of a blackandwhite tiled wall concealing flashing lights and sound the soundtrack mixes a recording of the death scene from a theater production of shakespeare s othello , and the death scene from a production of verdi s opera otello scrawled onto the grout in between the checkered tiles are a few snippets of early american slave narratives othello was a moor , as we all know , the only black man in an allwhite cast he is also one of the few black characters in shakespeare , and tragically ends up murdering his wife but while there is some intimation of racial politics running through the play , are not love , deception and jealousy its core themes \? o ! beware , my lord , of jealousy it is the greeneyed monster which doth mock the meat it feeds on , iago says to othello in act iii , scene iii jealousy , not racism , is largely behind iago s wicked deception regional art settings are not the sort of places where history is often made for starters , they rarely have the resources to commission or exhibit groundbreaking work but over the last few years , through judicious programming , retooling of the board and aggressive fundraising , the aldrich has labored to drag itself into a bigger arena for an artist of the caliber of mr wilson , the united states representative at the 2003 venice biennale , to come here and present anything other than his very best is , well , disheartening fred wilson black like me , aldrich contemporary art museum , 258 main street , ridgefield , through jan 8 information \( 203 \) 4384519 or www aldrichart org photos black memory , a wooden vitrine filled with ink bottles and oil cans , above , and drop dripped by fred wilson drip , drop , plop is part of the exhibition fred wilson black like me at the aldrich contemporary art museum
many liberals who oppose judge samuel a alito jr s nomination to the supreme court focus on his \( losing \) position in planned parenthood v casey , a 1991 case about a pennsylvania law that would have required women seeking abortions to notify their husbands pennsylvania has a legitimate interest in furthering the husband s interest in the fate of the fetus , is the most widely quoted part of his opinion in that case there may be many reasons to oppose judge alito s nomination including the possibility , as highlighted in documents released yesterday , that he would seek to nibble away at roe v wade but his casey opinion is not one of them rather , judge alito s thinking about the role of men in reproductive decisionmaking is in keeping with how legal thinking needs to evolve in this age of readily available dna testing nor is his position contrary to national sentiment a majority of americans feel that the husband should be notified about an abortion his only problem was not going far enough , relying only on the marriage contract to legitimate men s claims to a role in the reproductive decisionmaking process bear with me here about a decade ago , my girlfriend became pregnant it was n't planned , but it was n't exactly unplanned either , in that we obviously knew how biology worked i desperately wanted to keep the baby , but she was n't ready , and there were some minor medical concerns about the fetus , so she decided to terminate the pregnancy against my wishes what right did i have to stop her \? as it turned out , none it was , indeed , a woman s right to choose not surprisingly , we broke up and my desire for fatherhood was eventually fulfilled by two wonderful children but every so often i think back to the fateful decision , and frustration boils up i am particularly reminded of it now , as i counsel a friend who finds himself in a parallel but reverse situation when he broke off his engagement , his girlfriend told him that she was pregnant and was going to have the child no matter what that is her right , of course , and nobody should be able to take that away but when men and women engage in sexual relations both parties recognize the potential for creating life if both parties willingly participate then should n't both have a say in whether to keep a baby that results \? the abortion debate has polarized into a shouting match about two fundamentally different conceptions of conception , as it were the antiabortion position asserts that at the moment sperm meets egg a new human has been created , endowed with its own rights much of the recent strategy of antiabortion advocates has been to attempt an end run around roe v wade by establishing legal personhood in subtle ways through administrative fiat for example , the bush administration decided to include fetuses under the children s health insurance program , a tricky maneuver that creates a paradox for liberals who wish to expand the health coverage of pregnant women , but who loathe the idea of establishing legal claims on behalf of fetuses other such tactics include the attempted appointment of a state guardian for the fetus of a severely retarded woman by gov jeb bush of florida in the face of such strategies , the prochoice movement has desperately clung to the notion that the fetus is part of the mother and not a separate person prochoice advocates argue that the debate is really about a woman s control over her body hence my lack of rights to have any say in whether my seed comes to fruition of course , most americans seem to fall somewhere between these two positions they support abortion rights , but they are also willing to accept restrictions on those rights they do not think a fetus is the same as a person , but neither do they think of it as part and parcel of a woman s body like her appendix , a kidney or a tumor they see a fetus as an individual under construction hence the almost universal support for abortion in the case of risk to the mother why not opt for protecting life that is already here on earth over something that is still , ultimately , potential \? while the abortion debate has been stuck in neutral , the last decade has been marked by two other legal and cultural developments that should have but have n't influenced reproductive policy genetic testing and the responsible fatherhood movement the two go hand in hand today we can know who the real father is , thanks to dna testing this means that society can hold fathers responsible for the children they sire and this is exactly what is happening a recent focus of social policy in general and welfare reform in particular has been responsible fatherhood efforts to collect child support from deadbeat dads have increased so have efforts to bring those fathers within the sphere of their families nobody is arguing that we should let my friend who impregnated his girlfriend off the hook if you play , you must pay but if you pay , you should get some say if a father is willing to legally commit to supporting and raising the child himself , why should a woman be able to end a pregnancy that she knew was a possibility of consensual sex \? why could n't i make the same claim that i am going to keep the baby regardless of whether she wants it or not \? well , you might argue that all the man provides is his seed in a moment of pleasure the real work consists of carrying a child for nine months , with the attendant morning sickness , leg cramps , biological risks and so on but how many times have we heard that fatherhood is not about a moment , it is about being there for the lifetime of a child \? if we extend that logic , those 40 weeks of pregnancy as intense as they may be are merely a small fraction of a lifetime commitment to that child the bottom line is that if we want to make fathers relevant , they need rights , too if a father is willing to legally commit to raising a child with no help from the mother he should be able to obtain an injunction against the abortion of the fetus he helped create putting this into effect would be problematic , of course but while such issues may be complicated , so is family life better to deal with the metaphorical dirty diapers than to pursue an inconsistent policy toward fatherhood and an abortion debate that does n't acknowledge the reality of all actors involved otherwise , do n't expect anything more of me than a few million sperm oped contributor dalton conley , the director of new york university s center for advanced social science research , is the author , most recently , of the pecking order which siblings succeed and why
when two officers turned on their turret light and siren and pulled a uturn on a brooklyn street early monday , they most likely had no inkling that they might be trailing a man who had reasons to resist being caught the driver , allan cameron , was wanted for assaulting officers in pennsylvania two years ago , had 53 small bags of marijuana in his car , and was carrying a loaded 9millimeter handgun , the authorities said and just nine days before , the police said , he robbed an offduty officer in brooklyn , stealing his jewelry and police identification card before shooting him in the shoulder those details emerged only later , after the driver shot five bullets at his pursuers , authorities said , killing officer dillon stewart mr cameron , 27 , who was captured at his girlfriend s apartment , was arraigned yesterday on multiple counts , including the firstdegree murder of officer stewart and the attempted murder of the offduty officer , wiener philippe in lower manhattan , gov george e pataki spoke of the case to reiterate his support for the death penalty , a view not shared by mayor michael r bloomberg dressed in a gray sweatsuit and bright orange slipon shoes , his hair tied in a standing ponytail and a bandage above his left eye , mr cameron stayed quiet throughout the proceedings as police officers from throughout the city packed the brooklyn courtroom judge richard allman ordered him held without bail on nov 19 , prosecutors say , mr cameron robbed and shot officer philippe , 26 , outside the officer s home on st john s place then , on monday , as officer stewart and his partner , officer paul j lipka , began to follow him and check his license plates after he sped past them and ran a red light , mr cameron led them through the streets south of prospect park and at one point stopped and started shooting , law enforcement officials said one bullet struck officer stewart , 35 , under his left arm , passing through the armhole in his protective vest wounded in the heart , he chased mr cameron s car until it went into a parking garage he died at a hospital despite furious attempts to save him a law enforcement official said mr cameron has admitted only to driving the maroon 1990 infiniti q45 sedan that pulled alongside the two officers on flatbush avenue , but has given conflicting statements about what happened next first , that another person riding in the car with him , whom he did not name , fired at them and then , that he was alone and never fired at them , but heard the shots as he drove away but there is other evidence connecting him to each of the shootings , investigators say an empty gun magazine and the 9millimeter glock model 17 gun that it belonged to were both found behind the apartment building where his girlfriend lives and where mr cameron was arrested , they said shell casings recovered from officer stewart s car as well as at the scene of the shooting came from that gun , officials said mr cameron s girlfriend , whom her uncle identified as maritza nicholas , wiped the gun clean of fingerprints before one of them threw the gun and its magazine out the window , a law enforcement official said the keys to the infiniti were recovered at ms nicholas s apartment , investigators said police commissioner raymond w kelly said a decision on whether to charge ms nicholas depends on her level of cooperation a person who answered the door at her apartment yesterday said she was not at home though investigators say mr cameron used a different caliber gun to shoot officer philippe a 380caliber pistol , rather than the glock officer philippe identified mr cameron , from a photo and a lineup on the morning mr cameron shot officer philippe , the two faced each other for more than a few moments , said commissioner kelly , explaining why officer philippe s identification was credible this was a personal confrontation , he said this was a one on one , and it lasted for some period of time , he said if the evidence collected by investigators so far ties mr cameron physically to the two shootings , fixing his motives for attacking officers is a more difficult task he had a number of motor vehicle infractions on his record , and was on probation for an incident in january 2003 , in which he tried to speed away from officers who had tried to stop him , hitting one of them this does not sound like him , said leslieann davidson , his former companion , who said that mr cameron called her soon after he was arrested ms davidson , a teacher in florida , said that mr cameron had planned to move to florida to be near her how do you go from only being arrested for driving and now you 're a killer \? to me , it just does n't add up in march 2003 , according to pennsylvania court documents , mr cameron showed a more volatile side during an incident on the outskirts of philadelphia several officers tried to arrest mr cameron while he was yelling and ranting and running onto a highway he resisted , kicking a police officer several times , and breaking windows on a police car he was charged with aggravated assault and never showed up in court , according to law enforcement officials a spokeswoman for the philadelphia district attorney said that the court sent a letter to authorities in new york in december 2003 , requesting mr cameron s arrest and extradition to face the assault charge , which carries a sentence of up to 10 years he had been due to appear in a new york court on one of his traffic violations police officials in new york said they had never received that request in court yesterday , mr cameron s lawyer , edward friedman , called attention to the bandage over his client s left eyebrow , but did not say how mr cameron got the injury mr kelly said there was a struggle when officers arrested mr cameron and that he was treated at a hospital for a slight bruise over the eye he said mr cameron had not been assaulted at a groundbreaking ceremony for the goldman sachs headquarters in lower manhattan , governor pataki and mayor bloomberg , two republicans , voiced opposite opinions on future punishment for officer stewart s killer in my view , said mr pataki , when a police officer is killed in the line of duty by someone who murders them while committing a crime , the death penalty is an appropriate remedy but mr bloomberg reiterated his opposition to the death penalty a mistake would be so tragic , i 'd rather lock somebody up and throw away the key , and you can put them at hard labor , he said last year , the state s highest court ruled that part of the state death penalty statute was unconstitutional , effectively halting its use outside the courtroom after mr cameron s arraignment , patrick j lynch , the president of the police union , also spoke briefly about the case against mr cameron there is evil that cannot be taken out of a man , mr lynch said if this case does not speak of the need for a death penalty as a deterrent , none ever has the officers who came in uniform and plainclothes , in suits and in sweatshirts , wearing badges on chains around their necks gave a round of applause , then filed out past the metal detectors at the entrance and back into the brooklyn streets
the rulings of the national labor relations board have poured out one after another in recent months , with many decisions tilting in favor of employers the republicandominated board has made it more difficult for temporary workers to unionize and for unions to obtain financial information from companies during contract talks it has ruled that graduate students working as teaching assistants do not have the right to unionize at private universities , and it has given companies greater flexibility to use a powerful antiunion weapon locking out workers in labor disputes and in a decision that will affect 87 percent of american workers , the board has denied nonunion employees the right to have a coworker present when managers call them in for investigative or disciplinary meetings the partyline decisions have been applauded by the republican party s business base , which sees them as bringing balance after rulings that favored labor during the clinton administration but some academic experts on labor relations say the recent rulings are so hostile to unions and to collective bargaining that they run counter to the goals of the national labor relations act , the 1935 law that gave americans the right to form unions these decisions come close to or even match the reagan board in their intensity and vigor in promoting employer powers , said james a gross , a professor at cornell university who has written several books about the board they are pressing the outer limits of what could be a reasonable or legitimate interpretation of the balance between employer prerogatives and worker rights in my mind , this is fundamentally inconsistent with the purpose of the national labor relations act , which is to encourage the practice and procedures of collective bargaining robert j battista , the labor board s chairman , denied that the panel was stretching the law to help corporations all the cases that we 've decided have been well reasoned , mr battista said they 're certainly consistent with the act i would n't characterize them as probusiness or prounion i 'd like to say they 're proemployee the board s defenders say it is merely continuing a long tradition of swinging back and forth toward management when a republican is in the white house and toward labor during democratic presidencies after eight years of a liberal clinton board and an extremely liberal general counsel , there is of course going to be some turning back toward a conservative agenda , said randel johnson , vice president for labor , immigration and employee benefits at the united states chamber of commerce the board has turned a corner here , but it s not a wholesale reversal of the case law in favor of the business community several recent board decisions , mr johnson pointed out , have reversed clintonera rulings that overturned precedents set by republican boards in a case involving ibm , the board voted 3 to 2 to overturn a clinton board ruling that gave nonunion workers the right to have a colleague accompany them to investigative or disciplinary meetings with supervisors the clintonera ruling was a reversal of a 1980 s decision in a case involving brown university , the board reversed a clintonera ruling involving new york university a reversal of a 1970 s decision that gave graduate student teaching assistants the right to unionize mr battista said , what we did restores the precedent that has been timehonored and had never been overturned by a court or by congressional action labor unions say the reversals will make it much harder to organize workers at a time when the percentage of americans belonging to unions is declining jonathan hiatt , the general counsel for the aflcio , said , the notion that in 15 or 20 recent cases the republican majority has changed board law in ways that take away worker rights , deny workers protection in organizing and collective bargaining , and give employers more latitude , that is really striking and very political the labor board has five seats , and the president appoints members to fiveyear terms for much of 2004 , republicans had a 3to2 majority , but two members stepped down in december , resulting in a 2to1 republican majority until the seats are filled unions are alarmed by the board s decision to hear several cases that question the legitimacy of card checks , one of labor s most successful tactics in adding members recently in the procedure , companies agree to grant union recognition after a majority of workers sign cards saying they want a union by agreeing to card checks , companies waive the right to hold a secret ballot to determine whether workers favor organizing with probusiness groups saying union organizers sometimes intimidate workers , mr battista said , it was time to take a critical look at card checks but the board s democratic members vigorously objected the issues raised by the petitioners were settled 40 years ago , they wrote to revisit it serves no purpose but to undermine a principle that has been endorsed time and again by the board and the courts many unions say unionization elections are less fair than card checks because they involve expensive and bitter campaigns in which companies often fire and intimidate union supporters and warn that plants may close if they become unionized charles craver , a professor of labor law at george washington university , said the board s conservative tilt would hurt unions , but less so than the conservative tilt of the federal judiciary , which he said was increasingly unfriendly to labor i think we have a labor board as conservative as any time since the reagan board , professor craver said it really troubles me because we 're revisiting a lot of cases that have been fairly well settled in october , the board upheld a company s decision to fire a worker who had asked a colleague to testify before a state agency to support her claim of sexual harassment by a manager the national labor relations act prohibits employers from retaliating against workers who engage in concerted activity for mutual protection , but the board found that the fired woman was acting only in her interests and not for mutual protection to safeguard other workers from harassment taken one by one , i do not think these are the kinds of decisions that make one sit back and say , 'this is outrageous , ' said theodore st antoine , an emeritus professor of labor law and former dean of the university of michigan law school at the same time , i have to concede that once more we 're in the nibbling process while none of them consist of a great big bite , the cumulative effect is to decrease the capability of unions to organize in september , in a case involving a trucking company that said it was in distress and fighting to stay alive , the board ruled that such claims did not trigger an obligation for management to furnish financial information to the union traditionally , when companies in contract talks say they cannot afford what the unions are seeking , they are required to provide information detailing their financial condition the same month , the board ruled that disabled janitors could not join a union with ablebodied janitors , on the grounds that the disabled workers' relationship with their employer was primarily rehabilitative and not a traditional employeeemployer relationship we have n't got a particular agenda , mr battista said nor are we attempting to press the outer limits of management rights we 're trying to strike a balance between union rights , management rights and employees' rights
once , visitors to the international swimming hall of fame could walk in the door and step onto the starting block mark spitz dived from to win six of his seven gold medals in the 1972 olympics they could watch clips of his races , see his olympic uniforms and have their pictures taken next to a wax figure that spitz joked looked more like the singer robert goulet but the hall of fame , in fort lauderdale , fla , fell on hard times in recent years its displays were deteriorating , its finances were a shambles and a burglary in december cost it much of its most valuable memorabilia so none other than spitz is stepping in to help as part of a sweeping reorganization designed to save the hall , spitz will become chairman of a new board the legacy of our sport was in jeopardy , spitz said friday in a telephone interview from his home in southern california i think it s time to be past that responsibility , to get something happening in a positive way last year , spitz was one of 20 olympians who were so angry with the state of the hall that they asked to have their memorabilia removed this helped force the resignation of the hall s chief executive , sam freas when the new chief executive , bruce wigo , took over in midmay , he enlisted the help of a corporate turnaround specialist and persuaded the 21member board to resign and give him special authority to appoint a new one that is the kind of drastic move that gets attention in business circles , and luring spitz , whose goldmedal haul made him a national icon , turned heads in the sports world people get old and die , but corporations and nonprofits get a chance at new life , said wigo , the former head of usa water polo and the father of wolf wigo , a threetime olympian in water polo this place is worth saving but convincing spitz , now 55 and a successful businessman , was not automatic spitz has done his share of motivational speaking and corporate appearances , but he has stayed out of sports administration circles and largely avoided olympic politics last year , he made an appearance at the united states olympic swimming trials to support michael phelps s quest to break his record of seven gold medals in an olympic games spitz believed it would help the sport \( phelps ended up with eight medals , six of them gold \) it also readied spitz to lend his name to another cause i think if you had asked me 10 years ago , i might have had a different answer , he said but timing is everything , and all of these things happened now i'm honored that somebody thought that i could help turn this around the hall of fame endured dwindling attendance as its displays grew outdated wigo said its endowment , once 1 million , had shrunk to about 400 , 000 because a lack of fundraising and sponsorship had forced the museum to tap it for everyday expenses when the museum was burglarized last december by a maintenance worker , it seemed to hit rock bottom a suspect was arrested and the memorabilia , which had been sold , was located but under florida law , the museum is required to buy back the merchandise from people who bought it in good faith the museum is in the position of not being able to afford its own items , which include the legendary swimmer johnny weissmuller s olympic medals after wigo became chief executive , he decided to call for help from the sports and business worlds he turned to a longtime friend , dennis carey , a consultant for the executive search firm spencer stuart carey helped recruit a new board for tyco international after a corporate scandal forced out its chief executive during a onehour conference call , carey convinced the hall s directors that they needed to step down he then started working to persuade spitz to lead a new board carey , a former swimmer and a son of a swim coach , will be on the new board i think it s a good thing , said john hendricks , who served on the former board we had lost our way the honorees were upset and they should have been the ceo had lost his credibility hendricks , a double gold medalist for australia in the 1956 olympics , said he was impressed with wigo s and carey s plans for the future , starting with the selection of spitz he would bring a tremendous amount of recognition to the hall , hendricks said he would be a wonderful addition spitz said he wanted to see stiffer standards for selection to the hall , an increase in fundraising and sponsorships and the modernization of the displays to make them interactive and childfriendly this time around , spitz will be far more than a wax figure
los angeles dressed in a puma tshirt , jeans and white sneakers , john singleton walked into the lobby of a building on the paramount pictures lot here and suddenly stopped in his tracks before him were two giant billboards one for a film he had bankrolled and produced , hustle flow , which hits theaters on july 22 , the other for his latest directorial effort , four brothers , due in august wow , a smiling mr singleton said , reveling in the double whammy that s pretty cool mr singleton is back in a big way , but to hear him tell it , he never left my last film made 240 million , he quickly pointed out in a recent interview he was referring to 2 fast 2 furious , the critically lambasted blockbuster he directed in 2003 hello , i 've been here yes , mr singleton has been here , churning out , on average , one film every two to three years but none has managed to generate the buzz of his 1991 breakthrough , boyz n the hood that is , until now written and directed by a newcomer , craig brewer , hustle flow , which mr singleton dropped more than 3 million of his own money to make , was the hit of this year s sundance film festival , winning an audience award , a 9 million price tag and mr singleton a 7 million twomovie deal with paramount and mtv films equal parts rocky and 8 mile , hustle flow tells the tale of djay , a memphis pimp who has a midlife crisis and decides to become a rapper the plot was a hard sell at first mr brewer and the producer stephanie allain knocked on doors for two years trying to land a deal in hollywood , but to no avail ms allain turned to mr singleton , hoping his pull would open doors they shot us down again , mr singleton said i was surprised by that he was more than surprised , ms allain said it was like a slap in the face it upset him so much he felt like his name value was on the line studio executives could n't see past the stereotypes and see the humanity in these characters , mr singleton said it did not help that they had terrence howard , a relative unknown , in the lead and mr brewer , a firsttime director , at the helm so mr singleton , inspired by mel gibson and the hiphop entrepreneur damon dash , decided to finance the film himself , thus violating hollywood s rule no 1 never ever spend your own money everybody thought i was crazy , mr singleton said everybody though he has been vindicated , mr singleton is not out of the woods just yet the road from sundance to box office glory is littered with the carcasses of small films that were supposed to hit it big so , mr singleton has been tirelessly promoting the movie during filming last august , he flew journalists to memphis to visit the set friends like spike lee and will smith have held private screenings for tastemakers and mr singleton has guarded prints of the movie with the ferociousness of rabid pit bull if it gets pirated it will be after the movie comes out , he said on the day of the interview , mr singleton , a consummate multitasker , had a power breakfast with executives at e ! and a lunch with an executive at dreamworks he then dashed over to a meeting about the soundtrack for four brothers , which stars mark wahlberg , garrett hedlund , the rb singer tyrese and andre 3000 , one half of the hiphop duo outkast because the film is set in detroit , mr singleton wanted a lot of old school soul the studio was asking for more contemporary urban hits there was a time when executives wanted to only put rock in everything , he said then it was techno and now it s hiphop mr singleton may have inadvertently had something to do with this turn of events it was his poignant depiction of life in the gangravaged streets of compton , calif , boyz n the hood , that established mr singleton as one of hollywood s most promising talents while the world of drivebys and crips and bloods had been chronicled in rap lyrics by groups like nwa , it had never been captured on celluloid at only 24 , mr singleton became the youngest person ever nominated for a best director academy award he followed two years later with poetic justice , starring janet jackson and tupac shakur higher learning , his next project , dealt with life on a socially segregated college campus in each of these films , main characters meet violent deaths mr singleton was out to do more than tug at heartstrings he was eager to provoke thought , to advance the conversation whether it be about race relations , gender bias , date rape , single parent homes or , preferably , all of the above i wanted to be taken seriously as a filmmaker and my first film was taken so seriously , mr singleton said , so i kept feeling like each film had to be more serious than the last one it does n't get more serious than rosewood , mr singleton s 1997 film about an africanamerican town in florida that was burned to the ground by a white mob in the 1920 s the film received tepid reviews and was a commercial flop and even worse , mr singleton said , it was trounced by booty call , which was released the same month you 've got to understand , before that i was a golden boy , the director said 'rosewood' was a whole different thing the studio did n't support it they were afraid of the picture you 're talking about black genocide mr singleton took some time off to gather his thoughts , travel , marry and divorce , and have more children \( five in total , with four mothers \) unlike other young directors , he was not grappling with how to break into the business , but what exactly he wanted to do in the business the answer was simple have fun finally i said , you know what , i'm in this business because movies saved me from delinquency , movies saved my life , he said i just want to make movies it does n't matter if they 're serious or not mr singleton went on to make films like shaft , a remake of the 1971 action movie , and baby boy , a commentary on the infantilizing of the black man mr singleton has grown fond of telling interviewers that he greenlighted hustle flow , and while that makes for a compelling sound bite it is a bit of a stretch his inability to get the film made within the system speaks to an even bigger issue in hollywood , the director spike lee said very few studios have people of color deciding what films get made , mr lee said there s not one africanamerican at a studio in a position to greenlight a film when that happens that will be landmark that will have far more impact than two black people winning academy awards in one year though mr singleton agreed with mr lee s assessment , he does say that blacks have made strides in front of and behind the camera in recent years when i came in the game it was more of a novelty to be a young , black male making movies , he said now it s not a novelty , which is good mr singleton said he wanted to continue to guide other young filmmakers through the moviemaking process there are a lot of talented kids making films on video , he said with the fervor of someone who struck oil once and is eager to drill again i'm looking for the next new stars now that he s got the hang of this producing thing , mr singleton , who is teaming with mr brewer again for black snake moan , about a girl who suffers from a sexual addiction , said he was ready to tackle movie moguldom i just want to be able to make the type of movies that i want to make and i do n't ever want anyone to tell me that if i really feel passionate about something i ca n't make that movie , mr singleton said i 've got to be able to say , well , i'm making it anyway , bye he threw his head back in laughter now that s power
washington , may 12 under siege from democrats over accusations of ethical impropriety , representative tom delay did what he does best on thursday night at an elaborate tribute in his honor he went on the offensive barely mentioning his own troubles , including a house ethics inquiry into his behavior , mr delay , the house majority leader , mocked the democrats for their losses in recent years and accused them of bitter extremism that has alienated them from voters no ideas , no leadership , no agenda , mr delay said in a speech to hundreds of conservatives gathered at the banquet and in just the last week we can add to that list no class but while mr delay only briefly touched on the scandals that have rocked his office , many guests were more direct about it and repeatedly dismissed the investigations as unfounded attacks orchestrated by democrats and the news media tom , please hang in there , jesse helms , the former senator from north carolina , said in a videotaped tribute another speaker , david keene , leader of the american conservative union , said the message we send tonight is simple enough we are conservative , we are proud of our leaders , we stand with our own , and none of us are going away anytime soon the master of ceremonies for the event , cleta mitchell , a washington lawyer , said , i do n't know about you , but this does n't remind me of any funeral i 've been to recently the event was intended to be a prominent show of republican support for the embattled majority leader reporters were encouraged to attend to see for themselves some in the conservative movement said they hoped to demonstrate that they would not abandon mr delay and would not , for example , call for his ouster as they had done with the former senate majority leader , trent lott of mississippi the only way delay would be damaged is if his friends walked away from him , grover g norquist , president of americans for tax reform and a prominent supporter of mr delay , said earlier in the day the 2 , 000atable tribute dinner at the capital hilton hotel , chiefly sponsored by the american conservative union , was specifically described not as a fundraiser but as a public relations boost for mr delay as he faces constant attacks by liberal democrats and continuous media scrutiny , according to the invitation guests wore hooray for delay stickers on their lapels a bluegrass band , jay armsworthy and eastern tradition , performed a salad of baby green lettuce with white truffle vinaigrette was followed by filet mignon and salmon wine flowed for dessert , mr delay was served a redwhiteandblue cake festooned with sparklers and plastic hammers a reference to his nickname , the hammer while the band played if i had a hammer absent from the dais was one of mr delay s most outspoken defenders , mr norquist , who was listed in the program as a sponsor earlier in the day he described the event as an important show of support for the majority leader but mr norquist was not visible at the dinner and seats at his group s table remained empty nor was there any highpowered representative from the white house at the event when one speaker , bob livingston , a former representative from louisiana , asked current and former member of congress to stand up , the showing was relatively sparse , perhaps two dozen when ms mitchell called one of the scheduled speakers , representative scott garrett of new jersey , to the rostrum , he did not appear ken mehlman , the head of the republican national committee , was perhaps the closest bush associate on hand i'm here to salute a leader who has , over a long career , and continues to serve the public interest , mr mehlman said as the dinner began i hope he continues in that job , because i think it s important to have an effective leader rather than quieting democrats' outcry about mr delay s actions , the dinner fed into it as liberals seized on the event to promote their causes tom delay is the poster boy of big government , fiscal recklessness and public corruption , said tony chaudhuri of campaign for america s future , a liberal organization that has begun a publicity blitz against mr delay he s the exact opposite of what conservatives say they stand for , mr chaudhuri said conservatives used to be interested in principles now they 're only interested in power correction may 14 , 2005 , saturday an article yesterday about a dinner at which conservatives paid tribute to house majority leader tom delay misstated the given name of the communications director of campaign for america s future , one of several liberals who used the event as an occasion to criticize mr delay he is toby chaudhuri , not tony
east rutherford , nj , april 27 the nets were flattened in miami in the first two games of their bestofseven series against the heat , losing by an average of 175 points by the time the fourth quarters rolled around , more suspense could be found in reruns of miami vice so when the nets showed up for practice at 2 pm wednesday , they had to battle the widespread notion that the series was already over the nets will face more than a formidable foe when game 3 tips off thursday night at continental arena their history in the nba playoffs will also be against them the nets have trailed by 20 in a bestofseven series twice before , and they lost both series but the most ominous statistic is that the nets have dropped seven consecutive games to miami , including five this season , all blowouts if the nets are worried that their season could be over by dinnertime sunday , after game 4 , they are not showing it at practice wednesday , they said that frustration and desperation had not settled in we believe in ourselves , vince carter said you know what i mean \? we believe we can play with any team in the league coach lawrence frank was quick to point out that the nets lost the first two games of their series last season against the pistons , with both games on the road the nets then won the next three at home before collapsing in games 6 and 7 at detroit perhaps frank is on to something the nets were battered in the first two games of the pistons series , losing by an average of 185 points our only focus has to be game 3 , frank said we ca n't get caught up in all the other things jason kidd , who is averaging nearly four fewer assists in this series than he did during the regular season , said the nets were relieved to be home we were in this position last year , he said so i think we know what it takes to protect home and what it means to be back at home and hopefully we can take advantage of that for the nets to turn the series around , they will have to shoot better in game 2 , they scored 2 points on the fast break , missed 11 straight shots in the third quarter and hit only 6 of 22 3point attempts so how do the nets intend on breaking their shooting slump \? keep shooting , carter said you know what i mean \? we 're getting the shots we want , and they 're not falling carter has been blanketed by the swingman eddie jones during the series and has made only 14 of 37 shots \( 38 percent \) the nets finished the regular season by winning 15 of their final 19 games , with carter averaging 31 points down the stretch he is averaging 24 points in the first two games against miami the heat has gotten solid performances from damon jones \( 30 points in game 1 \) and alonzo mourning , who began the season with the nets and had 21 points and 9 rebounds in game 2 shaquille o'neal , still hampered by a bruised right thigh , has not had to carry the load we 're going against one of the best teams in the league , kidd said so we 're back in that same situation of fighting for our lives mourning , largely forgotten after being limited in recent seasons by a serious kidney disease , leaped back into prime time he scored 8 points in the third quarter , and he appeared to vent the frustrations from his year and a half away from the game by flexing his muscles after a dunk and waving his arms wildly after a layup , stoking the fans' emotions he was probably the biggest reason , from a personnel standpoint , that we won the game , miami coach stan van gundy said richard jefferson could play a similar role for the nets in game 3 a forward who averaged 222 points in 33 regularseason games , jefferson had surgery on his left wrist in january he had 9 points in his return in game 1 he seemed to be more ease late in game 2 and finished with 14 points jefferson said he was looking forward to playing at home for the first time in more than three months i need to be at home , he said i need to be around familiar situations , especially since i have n't played in so long my first game in three months was a road game against a no 1 seed , you know , at their place that s extremely tough jefferson said that the nets would be ready thursday but , in perhaps the most telling sign of the day , he said he would not make any predictions we 're extremely confident , he said that does n't mean that we 're guaranteeing wins pro basketball correction april 30 , 2005 , saturday because of an editing error , a sports article on thursday about the nets' facing a twogamestonone deficit in the nba playoffs for the second consecutive year reversed the sites for two games in their 2004 eastern conference semifinal series against detroit the nets won game 5 on the road and game 6 at home
one night last december , mayor michael r bloomberg squeezed next to sheldon silver , the speaker of the state assembly , before a large menorah set up in a small midtown kosher restaurant the hanukkah ceremony was one in a series of chits that mr bloomberg attempted to tally with mr silver over the last year the mayor attended the bris of two of mr silver s grandsons , paid a condolence call when the speaker s brother died in august and held news conferences as often as possible in the speaker s lower manhattan district the mayor and the speaker lacked much of a personal relationship early in mr bloomberg s administration but these moves were all part of the effort by the mayor and his deputy , daniel l doctoroff , to achieve a central goal , a new stadium on the far west side of manhattan the courtship culminated on sunday in nearly 300 million worth of subsidies and other offers to draw business to lower manhattan , mr silver s highest priority the mayor proposed up to 5 , 000 in tax credits for each employee of any outoftown company that agreed to locate in lower manhattan , his aides said , along with rent subsidies worth 55 million a year for tenants who would agree to go into 7 world trade center and the freedom tower but the offers were dismissed with silence mr bloomberg s pursuit of mr silver had come too late on monday , a seemingly indignant mr silver exercised his veto over the stadium , all but extinguishing a goal that mr doctoroff the leading champion of several of the city s olympics bids had pursued for years as a result , it now seems far less likely that the 2012 summer games will be held in the united states in large part , according to interviews with many of the participants in the maneuvering , the project was doomed because mr doctoroff calculated long before mr bloomberg was even in office that the city could build the project while sidestepping lawmakers in albany and new york as such , according to the administration s critics , mr bloomberg and his aides failed to build a political coalition in albany early enough to sway crucial lawmakers it was only last summer that they realized that any one of albany s three leaders would have veto power over the stadium project , at which point they began to cultivate mr silver and , to a lesser extent , joseph l bruno , the state senate majority leader at the same time , the jets scrambled to gain the support of minority lawmakers and others for the stadium the team would occupy they thought they could bypass the legislative process with something of this size and scope , said richard ravitch , the former chairman of the metropolitan transit authority and top state economic adviser , who has been critical of the project that was just unrealistic mr silver said yesterday that sidestepping the state s political process was the city s most serious misstep i just think that nobody s opinion counted until it counted , he said they never talked to senator bruno , they never talked to me and they just proceeded ahead , and they used this olympic timetable as the hammer that was going to make everything that was wrong with the bid suddenly right mr bloomberg s aides differ sharply with this interpretation , saying they did everything possible to satisfy mr silver , but were greeted with a stone wall of stubbornness that they now consider to be badfaith negotiating several raised questions about mr silver s motives , and said that even if they had courted him early on , it now seems unlikely that it would have changed his position the mayor worked in good faith and presented substantive proposals that addressed what the speaker said his concerns were , said edward skyler , mr bloomberg s spokesman but the fact that he showed zero interest in any of them makes the whole thing look like a charade all sides agree that one of the most prominent and unforeseen impediments came from the intense and wellfinanced opposition by cablevision , the owner of madison square garden cablevision , which considered the stadium competition to the garden , pushed forward with an attack against the stadium plan on a scale never attempted by a private company against a city hall project all told , the privatesector logic that guided mr doctoroff and mr bloomberg for decades before their careers in public service , in which all projects succeed with the right combination of money and selling power , proved na ve and , for their stadium dream , fatal the vision for a west side stadium , which would house a football team , convention space and major events of a summer olympics , was one that mr doctoroff has had since the 1990 s , when he first began working to bring the games to new york back then , mr doctoroff said repeatedly that he feared that going though the legislative process would dilute or corrupt his idea so rather than develop a political coalition , mr doctoroff did what he knew best from his success as an investment banker he courted chief executives from time warner , merrill lynch and others , persuading hardened business executives that the olympics could happen here , and raising money for the cause he did have one friend in government who shared his disdain for albany and passion for stadium building rudolph w giuliani at a 2000 news conference , mr doctoroff stood with mayor giuliani , extolling the virtues of developing the west side and seducing international olympic committee members gov george e pataki , who was at war with mr giuliani , was not invited to attend , nor was any member of the state legislature a senior pataki official groused at the time , i guess he s going to do this project with the mayor real estate executives raised questions about the plan , but mr doctoroff was undaunted and when he was asked to serve under mr bloomberg , also fresh from the private sector and a believer in pushing against the status quo , he pressed on with mr bloomberg s blessing , mr doctoroff successfully formed a plan to sidestep the city council by proposing to rezone the west side , which required approval by the council , with a boundary line drawn down the middle of 11th avenue , leaving the stadium site out of the district s boundaries and outside the council s purview , to which it agreed , apparently happy to stay out of the fight , at least for a time the bloomberg administration tried to bypass the state legislature as well it wanted to insert approval for the stadium into the governor s bill to expand the jacob k javits convention center the legislature passed the convention center bill , but without the stadium provision strike one in the meantime , there was another economic development program with its own set of troubles brewing progress on the site of the world trade center site began to slow because of a confluence of factors , from security problems to infighting among state officials mr silver was growing uneasy that the commercial prospects for lower manhattan were being overshadowed by development on the west side , while the neighborhood became increasingly residential but mr silver was by no means the lone critic of the proposal in the final weeks , mr bruno , an upstate republican , became increasingly vocal in his criticism of the deal , questioning the 300 million state subsidy in june 2004 , with its legislative options exhausted , the bloomberg administration faced up to the reality of the state s control over the city s affairs they could not legally proceed without the approval of a littleknown board controlled by governor pataki , mr silver and mr bruno strike two then , there were the state s perennial budget problems the plan called on the metropolitan transportation authority to sell its land on the west side to the jets for well below its appraised value , at a time that the authority s officials were crying poverty to the state late on a friday in february , cablevision illustrated how the city had underestimated the authority s needs the company sent the authority a letter offering to buy the west side property for 600 million , far above the jets' offer of 100 million this move caught both the jets and mr doctoroff unprepared , but they were no less blindsided by the response from the authority s head , peter s kalikow , who had long loathed the idea of giving away a transportation authority asset for a bargain price he opened up the bidding to the world ultimately the jets prevailed , but only after a costly lawsuit and a significant cost in public opinion the stadium issue was not playing well in the polls , and cablevision took advantage with a barrage of negative television advertisements the company was aided by its close relationship with mr silver , whose former chief of staff was a lobbyist for cablevision , as was mr bruno s son all spring , the city waited to see what albany would do lawmakers even those who supported the stadium idea took umbrage when the mayor would say that they had to approve the stadium by a certain date or else , and then , each time a deadline was blown , create another deadline the olympic committee , however , repeatedly raised the stadium s approval as central to the city s bid last month , mr bloomberg revealed a menu of treats for lower manhattan at a news conference in chinatown , paid for with federal money that only angered mr silver more , his aides said , because the money had long been earmarked for lower manhattan projects , and the news media portrayed it as an attempt to buy him off \( those projects will continue \) the final push to sway mr silver came together last friday , after mr bloomberg spoke with mr silver early in the day and got what he believed was an agreement for more negotiations all weekend as mr silver took off for the sabbath , mr doctoroff and his staff worked through the night and into saturday , coming up with a final package officials said they were certain as of saturday afternoon that they had met all of mr silver s concerns and believed he would finally come on board saturday everybody thought there was a deal , said an official involved in the planning it was far beyond what everyone thought he wanted but on monday , it became clear that none of it had worked , as mr silver approached the microphones with a long statement strike three
cairo , nov 25 heading off a direct confrontation with the united nations security council , syria has agreed to allow five officials to leave damascus to be questioned in vienna by the prosecutor investigating the assassination of the former lebanese prime minister rafik hariri the announcement of a deal between syrian officials and the prosecutor , detlev mehlis , was first made in damascus on friday and later confirmed in a short statement issued by the united nations secretary general , kofi annan , in new york the secretary general is very pleased at the outcome of mr mehlis s discussions with the syrian authorities , and he expects their cooperation to continue throughout mr mehlis s investigation , the statement said in damascus , the vice foreign minister , waleed almuallem , held a news conference to announce the deal that called for setting the location in vienna , and not lebanon , as mr mehlis had originally asked for mr muallem also suggested that mr mehlis had guaranteed that none of the officials would be arrested or detained while abroad a detail that mr mehlis s office refused to confirm or deny in light of the guarantees handed over to syria , which came in harmony with what syria was seeking , and after the leadership studied the results of the meetings , it has been agreed to inform mehlis of our acceptance to his compromise that the venue of listening to the five syrian persons in the un headquarters is vienna , mr muallem said with just three weeks to go before mr mehlis is scheduled to present his final investigative report to the security council , syria has managed at least to diminish the charge that it has refused to cooperate with the investigation into mr hariri s assassination in a preliminary report to the council last month , mr mehlis presented evidence that cast suspicion on top syrian officials , suggesting that the assassination was planned and carried out by top government officials the report presented statements from witnesses that implicated asef shawkut , president bashar alassad s brotherinlaw and the head of military intelligence , as well as maher alassad , the president s brother , who heads the presidential guard the authorities in damascus , at the united nations in new york , and at mr mehlis s office refused to say if mr shawkut or maher alassad were among the five officials who would be sent to vienna for questioning when he presented his report , mr mehlis also sharply criticized syria , saying it had failed to cooperate with the investigation a charge syrian officials said was surprising and , they contended , more a case of miscommunication between the parties syrian officials have insisted that mr mehlis s initial report was politically motivated and that all of the parties identified are innocent after mr mehlis presented his interim report , the security council warned syria to cooperate or face the prospect of further action , which was taken to mean economic sanctions initially , mr mehlis had asked to interview top syrian officials in lebanon , a condition that the syrian government adamantly refused to accept the prospect of sending its top officials to lebanon for questioning was both humiliating for syrian leaders , who had ruled over lebanese affairs since the end of the civil war there , and risky in that the lebanese authorities might have arrested or detained the officials in damascus , the vice foreign minister said his government had received reassurances about respect for syrian sovereignty and guarantees concerning the rights of the individuals to be questioned and to return to damascus after interrogation the united states ambassador to the united nations , john r bolton , welcomed the compromise between syrian officials and mr mehlis we hope this syrian cooperation continues and grows , he said

peter brook a biography by michael kustow illustrated 334 pp st martin s press 2795 most of theater history belongs to actors and playwrights , but in the 20th century the stage became largely the domain of the director from meyerhold and reinhardt through ch reau and sellars , visionary and charismatic individuals have brought bold conceptions to theater and opera , reinterpreting classic plays , reinventing approaches to acting and investigating the relationship of the spectator to the stage in the second half of the 20th century , no director has had more influence or recognition than peter brook brook s productions of king lear , the tempest and a midsummer night s dream between 1962 and 1970 galvanized theater audiences and practitioners alike \( in the process , not incidentally , brook helped cement the reputation of the newly founded royal shakespeare company \) gone were romantic and quasirealistic settings , replaced by austere yet bold scenography that often revealed the mechanics of the stage and created startling visual effects while emphasizing the theatricality inherent in the texts a highly physical , even acrobatic approach to acting from rigorously trained ensemble casts shifted the emphasis from rhetoric to action the productions served to strip away a century s worth of cultural accretions that had , more often than not , turned british shakespeare into stale exercises suddenly , shakespeare was , in the polish critic jan kott s phrase , our contemporary such innovations were not limited to shakespeare stimulated through contact with the polish director jerzy grotowski and the american director joseph chaikin and the writings of the french theater visionary antonin artaud , brook in 1963 created the theater of cruelty workshop within the royal shakespeare company its goal was to reinvigorate theater through a theatrical vocabulary not tied to language the most notable production to come out of this experiment was the landmark 1964 production marat sade by peter weiss , in which the actors transformed themselves into the inmates of the mental asylum at charenton where they restaged the french revolution under the guidance of a fellow inmate , the marquis de sade so believable was the acting that audiences were often too stunned and terrified to applaud few of brook s experiments were , strictly speaking , new he borrowed freely from the vibrant avantgarde of the time he was , however , one of the most successful directors since max reinhardt in the 1920 s at bringing avantgarde approaches in acting and staging to institutional theaters and thus to mainstream audiences the result was revolutionary the staging of the classics was forever altered brook , who was born in 1925 in the suburbs of london to jewish immigrants from latvia , was attracted to both theater and film from his youth but on a scale far grander than most as michael kustow , a theater and film producer , writes in his authorized biography , the 10yearold peter staged a fulllength puppet production of hamlet for his family and made a film of laurence sterne s sentimental journey while at oxford brook had a penchant for filmmaking the most commercially successful of his nine films was lord of the flies \( 1963 \) , which , kustow argues , may have allowed brook to express his feelings of being an outsider within a british class system he detested brook received more acclaim for his fresh stagings of classics , opera and west end light entertainments , including , amazingly , the london and new york productions of the musical irma la douce but it was this very eclecticism that allowed brook to wed the avantgarde with the bourgeois theater following dream in 1970 , which toured the world , brook made a seemingly radical departure , though , as kustow explains , it was almost inevitable given brook s disaffection with british theater following a path that many 20thcentury directors had taken , brook withdrew from the public stage for three years and created a laboratory to investigate the very nature of theater he gathered an international group of actors in paris that would eventually become the international center for theater creation the company staged an original ritualistic work with an invented language , orghast , for the shiraz festival in iran \( a controversial event because of its sponsorship by the shah \) , and then embarked on an extended journey to africa in an attempt to find a universal language of performance this was followed by travels around the united states where they worked with the teatro campesino in california and visited indian reservations to observe native american performance practices from 1974 on , however , the output of the company was prodigious much of the deceptively simple work that his company created could be classified under brook s famous category of holy theater one of spiritual intent that seeks to reveal the hidden aspects of life often these productions were performed on a nearly bare stage with little more than a few carpets as scenery perhaps influenced by brook s lifelong fascination with gurdjieff , the results were often revelatory , provocative , even mystical , as in a strippeddown production of carmen , but with the exception of the epic mahabharata , none equaled the grandeur or spectacle of brook s earlier work his minimalist approaches to classics may disappoint those who still await another dream , but the austerity and spirituality might be seen as not unlike beethoven s later quartets or the nearmystical late work of michelangelo despite kustow s access to brook , there is little in his biography that is not already known it fills in some details missing from brook s more elegant memoir , threads of time \( 1998 \) , but borrows heavily from familiar published sources however , for someone looking to trace brook s journey from his student doctor faustus to the current tierno bokar , it provides a useful service arnold aronson s most recent book , looking into the abyss essays on scenography , will be published in july he teaches theater at columbia university
after a second straight shutout by the notsomighty veterans committee of the baseball hall of fame , there is no joy in brooklyn , chicago or minnesota gil hodges , the dodgers first baseman who hit 370 home runs and had seven consecutive seasons with more than 100 runs batted in , was eight votes short of election so was ron santo , the popular cubs third baseman tony oliva , who won three american league batting titles with the twins , was 12 votes short compared with the first ballot two years ago by the realigned veterans committee , which mostly consists of 60 living hall of famers , hodges was two votes closer to election and santo was six votes closer , but oliva , strangely , attracted two fewer votes with the status of the three leading vote getters remaining status quo for all practical purposes , it s time not only for the cooperstown poohbahs to rethink this realigned committee s selection process , but also to question the responsibility of the donothing committee , which also included 22 living honorees of the hall of fame s writer and broadcaster awards and a member of the old veterans committee granted , the hall of fame is the most subjective subject in any sport who should be in a hall of fame and who should n't be \? that is the question , especially with debatable players the arguments usually end with neither side changing its mind you 're always entitled to your opinion and subjectively , your opinion is as good as anyone s but after two veterans committee shutouts , it s fair to wonder how responsibly do the hall of famers , especially the 58 explayers among them , take their duty as voters \? do they really study the two pages of statistics , rankings and highlights supplied to them for each of the 25 candidates on the ballot particularly those of players from other eras whom they never competed against and probably know nothing about \? do they just glance at the list and make a snap judgment \? do they dismiss some candidates with , he was n't as good as me , or do they hold a grudge against a pitcher who might have knocked them down with high inside fastballs or against a batter who got clutch hits off them \? in short , do they vote more subjectively than they do objectively \? or in the case of candidates from eras other than their own , do they really study those candidates' stats \? particularly annoying is that three committee members did not cast a ballot \( a fourth committee member , murray chass , the baseball columnist of the new york times , does not vote , in accordance with the newspaper s policies \) if they were ill , that s understandable but if they simply did not care enough about the process to fill out the ballot , they should be removed from the committee no vote this time , no ballot in two years when the committee will be polled again two years \? that s another weakness in this process why two years between elections for players \? and why four years between elections for managers , executives and umpires \? \( none were elected in 2003 \) in the past , an 18man veterans committee met every year to vote on the players who had slipped through the cracks of the annual baseball writers' association of america election , along with managers , executives and umpires , as well as players recommended by a panel familiar with the old negro leagues oddly , the former veterans committee elected more candidates than the writers have , 149 to 102 but in the first two votes by this new veterans committee , nothing happened in a conference call after yesterday s announcement , dale petrosky , the hall of fame president , praised this year s vote as a dynamic , not a static process because of the slight gains by hodges and santo while ignoring oliva s loss of votes in another sense , of course , there was nothing dynamic about the results no one elected no trend toward anything being different in 2007 from how it was in 2003 but this should be a difficult process , tom seaver , a voting hall of famer , said on a conference call the process is not to elect , but to go through the voting process and it s very subjective i voted for three , and when i talked to another hall of famer , he told me he had voted for three , but neither of us had voted for the same ones when seaver mentioned that he had telephoned joe morgan , the hall of famer who is now broadcaster , to discuss a certain candidate , he was asked how many other voters were as zealous as he was i do n't know , he said how many other voters were also as honest with themselves \? seaver recalled that two years ago , despite his respect for gil hodges , the dodgers slugger who was his mets manager , he did n't intend to vote for hodges there s no question that no individual was more important to me than gil hodges , but i was n't going to vote for him , seaver said but after studying his statistics , i said , 'this guy is a hall of famer ' and if you 're interested , if i had a ballot i would have voted for hodges , oliva , santo , jim kaat , maury wills , roger maris , marty marion , joe gordon , joe wood and curt flood you would think that every hall of famer who had made millions as a free agent , courtesy of flood s lawsuit , would have voted for flood but he got only 10 votes just another reason to question the responsibility of the voting hall of famers
miami dolphins running back ricky williams returns sunday after a fourgame suspension for violating the national football league s substanceabuse policy , the latest of several cases involving the league that raise questions for all sports about what drug testing can reasonably be expected to accomplish while congress has heavily criticized major league baseball for its drugtesting policy , those same lawmakers have praised the nfl , whose program is regarded by drug experts as the best among professional sports leagues in the united states still , about seven players a year fail the nfl steroids test , a number that is comparable to the 10 players who failed baseball s steroids test in the first year of its new drugtesting policy this season , the rookie fullback rick razzano of tampa bay was suspended for four games for failing a steroids test , and vikings running back onterrio smith was suspended for a year after he was caught with a whizzinator , a mechanism designed to subvert urine tests the nfl also investigated three players center jeff mitchell of carolina , tackle todd steussie of tampa bay and punter todd sauerbrun of denver after cbs news reported in march that they had filled prescriptions for steroids that were written by a doctor in south carolina who has since been indicted on federal charges none of the three tested positive under the nfl s program , and the players have not been suspended , but they will be subject to an increased number of random tests in the coming years all three players were playing for the panthers when they saw the doctor yesterday , the web site for 60 minutes reported that bill romanowski , a former linebacker for the broncos , admitted in an interview to be broadcast sunday that he took steroids from spring 2001 until fall 2003 , and that he got them from victor conte , founder of the bay area laboratory cooperative i think the fact that we still have some positives , in some ways i think that is sort of an inevitable reality , said the nfl s executive vice president , jeff pash , in a recent interview there will be some people who will try to get an edge but the fact that we have some positives i think suggests that it is quite difficult to get that edge and that the odds are that those efforts will be detected i'm not so na ve as to say that we will get to the point where there is complete absence of any illegal substances the nfl has twin programs one tests for performanceenhancing drugs , like steroids , and one tests for substanceabuse drugs , like marijuana and cocaine since testing began in 1989 , 57 players have been suspended for steroids , and there have been 60 more positive tests many in training camp on players who either retired or were released before their suspensions were announced that is a total of 117 positive steroid tests in 16 years , or about seven a year there have been just two repeat positives by an individual player in the steroids program the policy currently calls for a player to be suspended four games for a first positive test for steroids the nfl recently lowered the threshold for the level of steroid necessary to trigger a positive test had the threshold been lowered earlier , more players taking small amounts of steroids might have been caught it s clear that the program is adaptable to deal with changing circumstances , said doug allen , the assistant executive director of the nfl players association this is an arms race , and it s never going to be over testers are always going to be sprinting to catch up to those that would avoid and evade testing that s a given there have been 165 publicly announced suspensions for substanceabuse violations , including several repeat offenders under the rules , players are not suspended for a first substanceabuse violation the way they are for performanceenhancing drugs williams was suspended because he tested positive for marijuana several times many players are in the league s substanceabuse program , most of them anonymously , because of one positive test or an incident , like a drunken driving arrest subsequent positive tests lead to suspensions and fines the nfl is ahead of the pack , i do believe that , but there s a lot of buts , said dr gary wadler , a new york university professor and a member of the world antidoping agency among them wadler wants the nfl to adopt wada s exhaustive list of banned substances , which is compiled with input from sports governing bodies worldwide and is much more farreaching than the nfl s list for example , wadler said the nfl should categorize amphetamines as performanceenhancing drugs amphetamines are currently considered a violation of the substanceabuse policy , which imposes lesser penalties the nfl and the players association contend that a onesizefitsall list wo n't work , because there are many sportspecific drugs and practices for example , those that boost the endurance of longdistance cyclists that are irrelevant in football wadler believes the nfl should farm out its drug testing to an independent body , as the olympics does , both to avoid the appearance of conflict of interest \( the league office also hears and decides all appeals \) and to keep up with the science of doping wadler believe the process should be more open to the public , especially after a player s case is decided he wants the type of drug detected made public , arguing that it would help educate those who are charged with cleaning up sports they , too , will come to the realization that no matter how earnest they are , they 're going to have the problems the olympics have had of perception , and that s the court of last resort what do people think \? wadler said that is already a struggle with the substanceabuse policy with a wink and a giggle , some players confess to using drugs oakland raiders receiver randy moss said in a recent television interview that he smoked marijuana occasionally williams has admitted that he has failed drug tests , and last year , after he retired , he created a firestorm when he told sports illustrated that some players drink a masking agent to hide marijuana use before tests there are stipulations in the drugtesting policy about diluted samples , an effort to stop players from using masking agents there is a strict protocol for how urine samples are obtained a monitor watches as a player with no shirt on , and pants dropped to his ankles urinates it is intrusive , embarrassing and , the league believes , virtually cheatproof still , as much of a deterrent as such a scene might seem , everyone acknowledges that those who are determined to use drugs to cheat or who want to use them recreationally will convince themselves they can get away with it i have four f s for why athletes use drugs fame , fortune , free time and a feeling of invincibility , wadler said they push the envelope and think they will avoid being detected and believe they will never get sick that s the makeup of an athlete , their sense of invincibility washington redskins tackle ray brown , a 20year veteran , believes that the randomness of the tests and especially the threat of significant fines is a deterrent for most players brown remembers the redskins' trainer tapping him on the shoulder to alert him to another drug test so often in 1992 eight times that he became convinced the nfl had it in for him the randomness of the tests had turned routine for brown , just another part of his season , just as the league wants it no long sleeves , you have to take your shirt off and you have to drop your pants to your ankles it s ugly , brown said eventually , what happens is guys say that s just part of the job we 'll make fun of it and i think when it becomes a joking issue , you know it s indoctrinated itself into our culture which is a good thing
with vast reservoirs of oil and the potential to rival saudi arabia as a megaproducer , iraq has long tantalized the world s energy industry , as well as economists and political leaders worried about the impact of high oil prices but the new iraqi government s glaring failure last week to agree on an oil minister and the sectarian bargaining over this crucial appointment , as well as the unabated insurgency , have been new reminders of the political faults that keep the country s petroleum promise unrealized unfortunately , oil in iraq is being politicized more and more , issam alchalabi , who was iraq s oil minister in the late 1980 s , told a conference of scholars and oilcompany executives in washington in late april this is dangerous mr chalabi , now a consultant based in jordan and baghdad , is not related to ahmad chalabi , the former exile who , in the latest of his political ups and downs , has been appointed interim oil minister as recently as this april , a senior iraqi leader evoked the eternal dream that iraq could produce 10 million barrels a day close to the saudi levels within 10 to 15 years far less progress than that could alter the global oil market and aid consumers everywhere but two years after saddam hussein was toppled production is limping along at about two million barrels a day , less than before the war , and even at that rate it may be causing longterm damage to poorly maintained fields american officials had hoped that output at this stage would be at three million barrels a day , generating badly needed funds for reconstruction that level of production could also reduce oil prices , which are now around 50 a barrel and a global source of inflationary pressure but close to 2 billion worth of american technical aid to the oil sector has brought only limited gains sabotage of a pipeline to turkey has choked off exports from iraq s northern fields , around kirkuk , and violence has slowed efforts to renovate the larger southern fields but even if the insurgency is tamed , oil experts say , iraq will never receive the foreign investment and advanced technologies it needs until the country has a strategy and laws , ideally enshrined in a constitution , for developing hydrocarbons can foreign firms be partners in exploring and drilling new fields and in reaping the product , or will they simply be hired to do the work \? whatever pattern iraq chooses , it must be clearly delineated , industry executives say , and with protections offered to foreign investors the volatile question of regional autonomy , especially for the kurds who want more control over kirkuk and its oil , must also be resolved before outsiders will be likely to put large amounts of capital at risk these issues and more are at play as the newly elected iraqi leaders seek to write a constitution this year and , more immediately , try to agree on who should become oil minister the stakes are high , for iraq and for the world s consumers even if achieving saudilevel output seems little more than a pipe dream , every incremental gain can make a global difference in the price of oil , energy experts say if the northern pipeline could be secured and those fields were brought to their existing capacity , enough oil could flow to change the world oil market , said lawrence kumins , an oil expert at the congressional research service the kirkuk fields could be producing 800 , 000 barrels a day within six months to a year , mr kumins said , and the world oil market swings on a million barrels a day herman franssen , an oil specialist at the center for strategic and international studies in washington , cautioned against too much optimism even if iraq s political situation stabilizes , he noted , it takes years to sign contracts and get oil wells working any major decisions on oil development must also await the results of a technical study , being conducted by british petroleum and royal dutch shell , that will chart the state of the country s oil fields and assess the most promising next steps doubling output to four million barrels a day by the end of the decade would be a major achievement , mr franssen said and that would make a big difference in the global market , absolutely there is a near consensus in the oil industry , he said , that prices will remain high in the coming years , though not necessarily at recent levels of 50 a barrel and more barring a widespread recession , he said , prices may bottom out at 30 rather than the previous low of 18 no one doubts iraq s physical potential for enormous production only 17 of its 80 known fields have been developed , and the costs of bringing new production on line are among the world s lowest , according to the united states department of energy only about 2 , 300 wells have ever been drilled in iraq texas alone has a million huge geologically promising areas of iraq have never been explored with advanced seismic techniques but the focus now is simply on resuming maintenance at existing fields to safeguard their output since the international sanctions that followed iraq s invasion of kuwait in 1990 , the country has done virtually none of the customary nurturing of oil wells normally carried out every one to three years also halted was the constant drilling of new wells , which is necessary to replace old ones , to reach shifting reservoir pockets or to apply strategic injections of pressure in a desperate effort to maintain underground pressure , large amounts of fuel oil were injected into some wells , gumming them up of the 1 , 500 producing wells in the south , at least 20 percent need to be replaced , mr chalabi , the former minister and consultant , said
charmin has a new lowrent cousin , charmin basic it s slightly less squeezably soft but it s a lot less pricey than procter gamble s other toilet paper hold onto a little more change , is the tag line of one ad that shows a wet piece of charmin basic holding the weight of two silver dollars procter s bounty has a less expensive version hitting markets now , too and , while procter is among just a handful of companies introducing downmarket versions of upmarket brands , it has a lot more company when it comes to advertising to a budgetminded nation indeed , consumer products companies are addressing costconsciousness with a zeal usually associated with recessions , not economic recoveries and marketing experts offer a potpourri of theories about why some cite high gas prices , which continue to pinch middleclass budgets \( the greater cleveland regional transit authority has posted highway billboards , and broadcast some radio ads , reminding drivers that taking trains can ease the pain of skyrocketing gas prices \) others cite the impact of walmart , costco and other bigbox retailers , which enable consumers to get generic prices by buying brand names in bulk others mention the proliferation of highquality store brands and still others note that attitudes have changed welloff consumers who once would have blushed mightily if caught shopping at a price club now flaunt their bargainhunting acumen with pride the reasons , taken together , add up to a brutal dose of reality for consumer products companies as sridhar balasubramanian , an associate professor of marketing at the kenanflagler business school at the university of north carolina , put it , the premium that consumers were traditionally willing to pay for a brand name is under attack actually , the companies themselves have more idiosyncratic reasons for chasing the budgetconscious buyer any share we can gain back from anheuserbusch in the economy segment will help provide cash flow for our mainstream and worthmore brands , said peter marino , a spokesman for the miller brewing company , which next month will begin advertising milwaukee s best light , one of its least expensive beers , on the world series of poker on espn the spots have already been shown in a few local markets in the first television campaign miller has run for the economy brand in more than five years procter , whose charmin and bounty brands lead their markets , has a mirrorimage reason for introducing charmin basic and bounty basic charmin and bounty have led their markets for 25 years , and we realized that we had to address a new consumer segment if the brands were to continue to grow , said celeste c kuta , a spokeswoman for procter s family care products of course , there is nothing new about using price as a comeon to increase sales centsoff coupons and store promotions were a staple of the shopping experience long before most currentday shoppers were born nor is downward brand extension a radically new idea mercedes now sells relatively inexpensive versions of its luxury cars , and apple has cheaper ipods and unlike , say , united airlines and delta air lines , which put different names ted and song , respectively on the scaleddown versions of their premium products , these companies proudly slap their vaunted brands on their lowcost offerings what is new , the experts say , is the stress on budgetfriendliness by sellers of branded consumer staples like toilet paper or batteries or detergents they have normally operated on the theory that consumers who buy products based on the price probably switched to store brands or other lowcost alternatives long ago thus , their ads and marketing have primarily stressed product attributes charmin s softness , bounty s strength , united s friendly skies in hopes that their brand names will be automatically associated with quality now many of them have pushed costeffectiveness to the top of the attribute list ads for tide coldwater , made by procter , stress how much consumers can save on energy costs 63 a year is the claim in one newspaper insert rather than how white and bright the clothes end up similarly , since november , duracell from gillette has been supplementing its trusted everywhere ads with a print and radio and , since last month , television campaign mocking heavyduty zinc batteries from its rivals eveready and rayovac the message is it s amazing how cheap they can make them when they use less powerful technology the implied message is duracell batteries may cost more to buy , but their longer life span means they cost less to use conversely , miller has concluded that now is a good time to woo cashshort drinkers to its cheaper beers its tongueincheek campaign for milwaukee s best light makes fun of young men cuddling little dogs , wiping grease off pizza or indulging in other actions that miller deems questionably masculine each 15second spot ends with the offender slammed in the head with a can of milwaukee s best light , and uses the tag line a man should act like a man , and a light beer should taste like a beer none mentions price but price is the elephant in the room , in that milwaukee s best has always been a lowpriced beer , so the ad campaign is aimed at persuading young men that drinking it will hurt neither their image nor their taste buds there was never a thought that we needed to stress value , mr marino said such approaches carry little risk to the basic brand but , experts say , companies offering a lowercost version of branded products are walking a tightrope they note that it took cadillac years to repair its image after it introduced the cadillac cimarron , its lowpriced and it turned out , lowperforming car in 1981 if you put the brand name on a clearly inferior product , you are shooting the premium brand in the foot , said judy hopelain , a managing partner at prophet brand strategy , a san francisco brand consultancy even companies that safeguard quality face hazards if they persuade dealconscious consumers that they can get brandname quality on the cheap , they may simultaneously persuade their highend customers that they might as well buy the cheaper version it s a tradeoff , said john t gourville , an associate professor specializing in pricing research at the harvard business school the brand name gives you the credibility to quickly gain share in the lowerend market , but there s the danger that you 'll dilute the premium brand others note that the more iconic the brand , the greater the danger that the cheaper versions will cannibalize the premium ones if you 've already persuaded people that only the best products are sold under your brand , then they 'll readily buy the least expensive item with that brand name , warned michael watras , president of straightline international , a brand consultant in new york but as plentiful as the traps may be , they are avoidable packaging can be a great differentiator for example , the word basic is more prominent than charmin on the charmin basic package , and the charmin bears are nowhere to be seen moreover , many companies , procter included , are advertising their cheaper products only in newspaper inserts , saving costlier commercials for their premium items most important , marketing experts say , is to keep adding features to the premium product after the cheaper one comes out companies will be ok as long as they keep innovating in their premium line , ms hopelain said but , she warned , if they do not want a mass migration to the less expensive items , they 'd best not be tempted to put new features in the cheaper product for a long , long time
if you need a home in a hurry and do not mind salt air and salty neighbors , with 130 and your own roll of toilet paper you can move into the baxter hotel in rockaway park , a halfblock from the atlantic ocean that is the weekly rent charged by the owner , john baxter 130 , with no deposit , no security and no questions asked inside the office , a sign directs new residents to please read all the house rules carefully or ask management to read them to you for a 130 check , mr baxter handed a recent visitor the key to room 27 and said in his irish brogue , i hope you 're good at remembering faces , adding as he walked away , there s no mirror in the room his assistant , sean reeder , led the way up creaky stairs to a fourthfloor room smoking was permitted out the room window asked about the house rules , mr reeder said , just do n't do anything to make us kick you out the bathroom s over there , he added , pointing to three tiny bathrooms at the end of the hall two had stall showers none had sinks , mirrors or toilet paper they did provide views of jamaica bay and the atlantic the baxter is one of three singleroomoccupancy hotels huddled together against the world on beach 116th street , just down from the end of the a subway line it sits between a closed sro called the hotel lawrence and the rockaway park hotel , a functioning sro whose residents include young children and a man who wears outfits made from plastic garbage bags it is also a stubborn survivor of new york s shifting housing picture places like the baxter that offer humble lodgings to people of humble means have been steadily disappearing from the city s landscape , in part to make room for more lucrative real estate in 1998 , the last year for which the city has data , there were 46 , 744 sro units , down from 57 , 128 in 1993 in 2002 , a survey by the west side sro law project , an advocacy group , counted 35 , 227 units and while the baxter may be the only thing standing between its tenants and the street or a shelter , the hotel , like many sro s , is reviled and regarded by its neighbors as a fleabag that attracts undesirables most residents are acutely aware that many local homeowners and merchants consider them a blight on the community and want their home torn down a view stated regularly at community board meetings and in letters to the local newspaper so the baxter s tenants prefer to avoid conversation by scurrying silently by and squeezing behind their doors it s really 'live and let live' around here , ' explained one resident , jim hammond no one wants to be bothered they know the reputation people have of them and the place i 've learned to just keep my eyes looking straight ahead of me after all this time , i only know a few people here by name mr hammond , an administrator for the new york fire department , said he had been living at the baxter off and on for four years while on a waiting list for a studio coop he could afford in a highrise nearby his name had just come up so he was packing up to leave the baxter for good you could fit five of these rooms in it , he said , sitting in his hotel room a lineup of jockey shorts hung neatly on hangers next to his dress shirts after telling his story , he spelled his name slowly and added , that should make my exwife happy the rooms at the baxter are smaller than some elevators the one visited recently had a ceiling and walls painted powder blue there was a bald light bulb in a ceiling fixture , a dresser , a minirefrigerator , an itchy bed with mismatched sheets and a television equipped with an antenna , not cable airconditioners are banned at the baxter because its old electrical system could not support them , but with the door open , a salty breeze sweeps through the room and makes even sweltering days tolerable at night , the soundtrack is an overlay of arguments , children chanting , adults making love , a ballgame , talk radio , pop , rap , sitcom laughtracks and lowflying jets bound for kennedy airport next door is annie kenney , 82 , a brooklyn native who took her disability checks and retired to the rockaways she can barely climb stairs because her knees are shot so mr reeder runs her errands and she stays up in her room for days at a time i'm used to it , she said i keep busy with the radio and the tv i like sports and the news the people here are all special people , she added i say a prayer for every one of them across the hall is a young man who works in the kitchen of a pizza hut in midtown he said he was just passing through , and when he walked away , mrs kenney said , that s what everybody says when they come here most people wind up at the baxter because of loss , either of family , friends , job , home , or all of the above richie veneziano , 51 , who lives on the second floor , said he was living a normal life as a banker in manhattan with an apartment in brooklyn and a place in florida then he had a stroke , stopped working and was evicted by his aunt my family used to have big sunday dinners , but when i hit the skids , they all disappeared and so did my friends and my apartment , he said no one wanted to know me anymore living on disability checks , he moved in with another aunt in rockaway , who eventually evicted him , too so he came to the baxter it s better than sleeping on the street , he said i had no place to go and very little money to find a room a halfblock from the beach is a bargain i'm in limbo , but it s a comfortable limbo mr baxter and his wife have a nice house several blocks away , but he spends most of his time around the hotel and keeps a suite of rooms for himself on the second floor in the afternoon , he drinks with the working stiffs and holds court at the sand bar , on the boardwalk next to the park inn psychiatric home , one of the many nursing homes and mental health facilities that are clustered nearby the openair bar is the center of the circus that is beach 116th street a busy commercial strip that attracts vagrants , drunks , mental patients and battalions of beachgoers mr baxter grew up on a farm in county cavan , ireland , and came to new york in 1954 he has run for the new york city council , published a local newspaper and is a fixture at community board meetings , speaking his mind and videotaping them for use on his monthly queens cable television show on the show and in plays and revues he produces in the small theater on the baxter s ground floor he skewers local politicians , whom he blames for letting the city turn the rockaways into the toilet of new york city the peninsula has a high unemployment rate and more than its share of housing projects and psychiatric and nursing homes luxury coop apartments are being built across the street , and rumor has it that the developer is offering the rockaway park hotel s owners 3 million to sell whatever happens , mr baxter says he is not selling this is all i have , fighting these bums , he said they 're going to have to carry me out in a tin box
no , it was n't a year of realism , joan didion said not long ago it was n't a year when realism saw you through didion was talking about her latest book , the year of magical thinking , a multilayered work of nonfiction that grew out of her desire to impose some order on the unruly agonies in her life the sudden death by heart attack of her husband , the writer john gregory dunne , and the serious illness of her daughter , quintana roo dunne michael , who died in late august at the age of 39 , after a medical odyssey that began more than a year ago , when a winter flu mysteriously morphed into total septic shock less than two weeks after quintana s death , didion was perched on a chair by the fireplace in the living room of her bright , airy upper east side apartment , the room where her husband died on dec 30 , 2003 , five days after quintana first went into the hospital clear glass hurricane lamps lined one northfacing window seashells were scattered on the coffee table and mantle paintings of horizons hung on the walls didion , who is 70 , wore a sleeveless white knit top and sky blue hospital scrubs as pants , a habit she adopted during the months spent looking after her daughter tiny and painfully thin , didion looked as frail as the white orchids that stretched their tender , tenuous necks from a cluster of pots in her entrance hall on the day of our conversation , floodwaters still engulfed new orleans didion said she had been watching the coverage of hurricane katrina on television until it got kind of candleinthewind though full of feeling , there is little candleinthewind about the year of magical thinking it is a kaleidoscopic account of the nearly 40 years didion and dunne spent together , writing at home in los angeles and new york and traveling the world to gather material for their books in her case , five novels and seven previous works of nonfiction it is the climax of a career built on polarities west coast and east coast , detachment and emotion , art and commerce , fragility and toughness still another dialectic emerges in the new memoir never has didion s attention to detail been so sharp , and her desire to break free of the bonds of reality so deep she documents quintana s medical situation with clinical precision on saturday , december 27 , we were told that she was being given what was then still a new eli lilly drug , xigris , which would continue for 96 hours , four days 'this costs 20 , 000 , ' the nurse said as she changed the iv bag and yet , at the same time , she finds she cannot bring herself to give away her husband s shoes , because he might need them when he comes back she cannot grasp that he is really dead i was trying to work out what time it had been when he died and whether it was that time yet in los angeles \( was there time to go back \? could we have a different ending on pacific time \? \) information is control , didion writes and yet , it was n't i was going mad , she said in our conversation before writing the book , i realized that i had not been entirely sane for most of the year i 'd been giving a real impersonation of a sane person , which was kind of shocking to me compared with her previous books , the year of magical thinking is much more direct , which was one of my intentions , didion said i thought if i was going to do it at all it had to be really direct and really raw in fact , the book grew out of medical notes she had been keeping i started writing it but it did n't feel like writing , didion said it felt just like sitting there and putting down what was on my mind , which is not the way i write usually , she follows a process of discovering what s on my mind and then hiding it , she said to tell this story , i realized the only possible form was just to repeat it over and over and over again and every time you repeated it , you added new details , or you subtracted details , because that s the way you think about it although her work has always had an air of disclosure , didion is not a confessional writer she avoids unbuttoned outpourings of emotion , and there is a controlled reticence about even her most personal revelations it s an approach that owes much to hemingway , her great influence , who famously said a writer can convey more by keeping much of his material below the surface , just as the dignity of movement of an iceberg is due to only oneeighth of it being above water while the year of magical thinking appears to be perfectly direct , didion admitted that there is as much withheld as there is told indeed , we learn much about dunne his sense of humor , his temper , his ferocious devotion to his wife but far less about quintana , the couple s adored adopted daughter , who remains something of an enigma that quintana had spent months in brain trauma units , on and off life support and sometimes with a feeding tube , was much on didion s mind this spring , when she wrote an essay in the new york review of books on the case of terri schiavo what was irritating to me , what provoked me into writing the piece , was the certainty with which every pronouncement on the case was being received when it really was just on the basis of nothing , didion said she was struck by how nobody was getting what a powerful image it was to remove the feeding tube , as easter week started didion was determined to point out the glibness of many of those who defended taking schiavo off life support \( in a now uncanny passage in didion s 1984 novel , democracy , a medical resident explains to inez victor that her murdered friend ca n't be declared dead until she is found to be technically dead it s not necessarily an eitheror situation , mrs victor , the resident says life and death \? inez asks , are not necessarily eitheror \? \) the schiavo essay was a strong reminder that didion has never been easily categorized although she has made her literary home in recent decades at the decidedly liberal new york review of books , she started out a goldwater republican born in sacramento , to a family whose roots in california go back generations both her parents' families had crossed the great plains in the 19th century like the selfreliant pioneer ancestors she so admires , didion has always been a maverick , an original thinker unswayed by the herd of independent minds georgia o'keeffe , with her radically original artistic vision and westerner s impatience with the faddish new york art world , was clearly a model like so many successful guerrillas in the war between the sexes , georgia o'keeffe seems to have been equipped early with an immutable sense of who she was and a fairly clear understanding that she would be required to prove it , didion wrote in an appreciation of the artist that appears in her second essay collection , the white album \( 1979 \) after graduating from the university of california , berkeley , and winning vogue s prix de paris student writing contest , didion moved to new york and worked as an editor at the magazine for seven years she later said writing photo captions taught her to make every word count homesick for california , she wrote her first novel , run river , which is set against the intense heat and flooding rivers of the sacramento river valley it was published in 1963 the following year , she and dunne , a time magazine writer and aspiring novelist she had met in new york , were married at the mission of san juan bautista in california , with a reception at the lodge at pebble beach while at vogue , didion started writing book and movie reviews for national review , the conservative biweekly her rave review of norman mailer s american dream , which she called perhaps the only serious new york novel since 'the great gatsby , ' prompted mailer to send a grateful letter to william f buckley jr , the magazine s editor what a marvelous girl joan didion must be i think that s one conservative i would like to meet , mailer wrote years later , in the book review , didion praised the executioner s song , mailer s account of gary gilmore s execution in utah , for the way it perfectly captured the vast emptiness at the center of the western experience , a nihilism antithetical not only to literature but to most other forms of human endeavor like mailer , didion placed herself in opposition to the east coast literary establishment , even while appearing in its pages in a review of the john wayne movie the alamo published in national review in 1960 , she wrote , i wept as wayne told his mexican inamorata how a man s gotta live i wept as he explained why republic is a beautiful word indeed , so conspicuous was my sniffling by then that you could scarcely hear the snickers from my neighbors , a couple of young men from esquire , both of whom resembled arthur m schlesinger jr they do n't make 'em like duke on the new frontiers \( echoes of this review would later emerge in didion s wonderful 1965 essay john wayne a love song \) but this clash of frontiers is perhaps best exemplified by didion s scathing 1979 attack on the faux adults in woody allen s movies this notion of oneself as a kind of continuing career , something to work at , work on , she wrote , is fairly recent in the world , at least in the world not inhabited entirely by adolescents this judgment may seem paradoxical coming from someone who has written at considerable length about her own anxieties yet even in her most private revelations , didion , through the force of her prose , communicates that she is speaking not just for herself , but for an entire generation just as in the crackup , her literary model f scott fitzgerald suggested a connection between his own depression and the national trauma of the great depression , in the title essay of the white album , didion excerpted part of her own psychiatric evaluation , taken in june 1968 , when she had experienced a deep sense of dread and panic what in lesser hands might seem mere selfdisplay becomes a broader diagnosis by way of comment , didion wrote , i offer only that an attack of vertigo and nausea does not now seem to me an inappropriate response to the summer of 1968 the psychiatric evaluation also offers a perfect summation of didion s literary vision patient s thematic productions on the thematic apperception test emphasize her fundamentally pessimistic , fatalistic and depressive view of the world around her , it read it is as though she feels deeply that all human effort is foredoomed to failure , a conviction which seems to push her further into a dependent , passive withdrawal in her view she lives in a world of people moved by strange , conflicted , poorly comprehended , and , above all , devious motivations which commit them inevitably to conflict and failure that is precisely the world of didion s novels , especially her second and most celebrated , play it as it lays , which is set in the existential desert of los angeles and full of women in extreme situations making extreme choices 'what makes iago evil \? ' some people ask i never ask are its famous opening lines published in 1970 , it catapulted didion to fame she wrote the novel in los angeles , where she and dunne had moved in 1964 , a decision she recorded in her iconic essay goodbye to all that among other things , new york was too crowded with writers after i finished the first novel , i found it very hard to start a second in new york because almost everybody i knew was a writer and everybody was telling me about what they were doing , didion said in our conversation california was liberating in 1966 she and dunne adopted a child at birth and named her quintana roo , after the mexican state in the late 60 s and 70 s , the couple wrote freelance for magazines , including the saturday evening post , where some of didion s most memorable essays first appeared it was a great place to work , she said , since it was about to go bankrupt and you could do anything drawn to hollywood , didion and dunne started writing screenplays they adapted play it as it lays \( 1972 \) , as well as dunne s novel true confessions \( 1981 \) , which starred robert de niro and robert duvall they also wrote the panic in needle park \( 1971 \) and up close and personal \( 1996 \) , starring michelle pfeiffer most of this work was unmemorable , but screenwriting supported an increasingly comfortable life a house in brentwood park with a swimming pool , frequent trips to didion s beloved hawaii it pays well , and it s fun , didion said in our conversation it s a cooperative project , as opposed to writing something , which is definitely not a cooperative project didion also said writing screenplays influenced her use of dialogue in her novels , especially the intercutting in a book of common prayer \( 1977 \) yet these hollywood inflections made her the object of some derision from literary quarters in a harsh review of democracy , mary mccarthy dismissed the novel s cinematic techniques perhaps joan didion is just wishing that she were an oldtime screenwriter rather than a novelist , she wrote in the book review in 1984 mccarthy also deplored the novel s depthlessness and its knowingness that didion assumes her readers will understand the cultural resonances of the dalton school , or grant park in chicago at the 1968 democratic national convention , was not , mccarthy said , an altogether pleasant quality james wood echoed mccarthy s line in a review of didion s most recent novel , the last thing he wanted \( 1996 \) didion is knowing at her people s expense , which is fatal to the creation of autonomous characters , wood wrote in the new republic although didion s novels may indeed suffer from a kind of stylized false knowingness , in her nonfiction , especially the personal essays that could run the risk of even greater hermeticism , didion speaks directly to the larger human situation the year of magical thinking is a shining example of that achievement but didion s novels can also be read as a commentary on her nonfiction told by detached narrators who become inextricably involved in the stories they 're telling , her three most recent novels are essentially meditations on the limitations of journalism the narrator of a book of common prayer declares she is an anthropologist who lost faith in her own method , who stopped believing that observable activity defined anthropos , while the one in the last thing he wanted is a journalist who leaves the campaign trail to run guns to the contras for her dying father the implication is that it takes an entire novel to illuminate what a newspaper would dispense with in the kind of twoinch wire story that has to do with chartered aircraft of uncertain ownership that did or did not leave one or another southern airport loaded with one or another kind of cargo in the reagan years , didion returned to writing nonfiction muchof it was about the irancontra scandal , including salvador \( 1983 \) , about the death squads of el salvador , and miami \( 1987 \) , about the american city closest to the surreal political realities of central america in 1988 she began to write about elections the dukakis campaign , the first clinton campaign , then the monica lewinsky scandal at the urging of robert silvers , the editor of the new york review of books and an important figure in the most recent phase of her career he involved me in domestic politics , which i had never been interested in , didion said he really sort of pushed me into doing it silvers and didion first met in the early 70 s i just thought she was a marvelous observer of american life , silvers said in my ignorance , i had missed her work in national review i simply thought she was a great writer and an observer didion does n't see her move to the new york review as a sign of her political evolution she said she first registered as a democrat after souring on reagan s california governorship i do n't think that my politics have changed a lot since i 've been writing for the new york review , she said i think they changed a little bit before that or they did n't change i just sort of started paying attention \( in many ways , didion s political trajectory mirrors that of another national review alumnus , garry wills for both of them , an unorthodox conservatism is the foundation for idiosyncratic critiques of power \) i think of political writing as in many ways a futile act , didion said , though it is one she feels a duty to perform you are obligated to do things you think are futile , she said it s like living it s a view that reflects her frontier ethic as much as her silent generation education at berkeley didion came of age in a world heavily influenced by existentialism , she said life ends in death but you live it , you know this may explain why didion s political writing is more about character detail than policy detail its clearest strength and greatest limitation that nancy reagan chose a new set of china for the white house , one with finger bowls , tells us much about the world of nancy reagan but less about her husband s part in ending the cold war in a review of political fictions , a collection of her essays from the 90 s , joe klein remarked that didion practiced a form of theater criticism , assuming and sometimes even asserting that politics was a lesser branch of show business , that politicians were merely actors reading lines , that political performance consisted only of public speaking and image making while the quiet work of governance , the true work of elected officials , was largely ignored yet didion s awareness that theatrics often carry more weight than facts informs some of her most perceptive political writing in her 1989 essay sentimental journeys , didion challenged conventional thinking about the rape of the central park jogger , a white , 30something wall streeter ostensibly set upon by a group of black teenagers , who confessed and were convicted of the crime didion saw that the whole affair mirrored the city s desperate mood , in its confusion of personal woe with public distress , even as many facts were obscured in the thirst for narrative resolution including that the prosecution s case never quite corresponded to the forensic evidence although the essay was criticized at the time , didion was vindicated 13 years later , when the manhattan district attorney s office reopened the case and overturned the men s convictions after finding dna and other evidence that another man had committed the crime it did n't surprise me , was all didion would say that essay signaled didion s own reconnection to new york , where she and dunne took up residence once again in 1988 i do n't know why we moved back to new york , didion said her husband was between books and feeling kind of restless , and the couple had been spending increasingly more time in a new york pied terre they had bought in 1984 our then secretary would fedex us meyer lemons from the trees , didion recalled at some point this did n't add up , you know so i said to john , 'well , if we were going to actually spend this amount of time here , we ought to get a more comfortable apartment' but that kind of entailed selling the house in california the year of magical thinking is to their return to new york what goodbye to all that was for their 1964 move west the journey was never simple didion once wrote that she felt miserable traveling crosscountry by comfortable airplane , for it weighs heavily upon my kind that we could perhaps not make it by wagon in many ways , grief that comes to a full boil in the year of magical thinking was already bubbling at the surface in where i was from \( 2003 \) , a deeply affecting exploration of california s origin myths and contradictions how , for instance , it prides itself on an ethic of selfreliance yet remains utterly dependent on federal agricultural subsidies part memoir , part cultural analysis , the book takes its emotional thrust from the deaths of didion s parents in one characteristically unassuming passage , didion writes about her father s possibly suicidal depression , and his treatment in san francisco when didion was in college once i walked across the bridge with him , she wrote , of the golden gate i remember that it swayed the book ends with the death of didion s mother , who insists didion take a silver ladle she had saved over the years 'take it , ' she said , her voice urgent 'i do n't want it lost' i was still pretending that she would get through the sierra before the snows fell , didion wrote she was not didion once said she believed in using the good silver every day , because every day is all there is the author of play it as it lays has little patience for imposed theories , yet recognizes that others do never underestimate the solace in a theory , or the fallingthroughspace many people of good will feel at the lack of one , didion once wrote yet it is precisely this palpable sense of the fallingthroughspace that gives the year of magical thinking its richness and resonance theory does n't help there is only the actual , immediate world , observed so closely that the banal becomes the metaphysical in a commencement address at the university of california , riverside , in 1975 , didion offered a general imperative that still illuminates her own disposition , even in the darkest times i'm not telling you to make the world better , because i do n't think that progress is necessarily part of the package , she said i'm just telling you to live in it not just to endure it , not just to suffer it , not just to pass through it , but to live in it to look at it to try to get the picture to live recklessly to take chances to make your own work and take pride in it to seize the moment and if you ask me why you should bother to do that , i could tell you that the grave s a fine and private place , but none i think do there embrace nor do they sing there , or write , or argue , or see the tidal bore on the amazon , or touch their children and that s what there is to do and get it while you can and good luck at it profile rachel donadio is a

let us be grateful that janet jackson did not bare both breasts on the first anniversary of the super bowl wardrobe malfunction that shook the world , it s clear that just one was big enough to wreak havoc the ensuing washington indecency crusade has unleashed a wave of selfcensorship on american television unrivaled since the mccarthy era , with everyone from the dying dday heroes in saving private ryan to cuddly animated animals on daytime television getting the ax even nbc s presentation of the olympics last summer , in which actors donned body suits to simulate nude ancient greek statues , is currently under federal investigation public television is now so fearful of crossing its government patrons that it is flirting with selfimmolation having disowned lesbians in the children s show postcards from buster and stripped suspect language from prime suspect on masterpiece theater , pbs is editing its feb 23 broadcast of dirty war , the hbobbc film about a terrorist attack , to remove a glimpse of female nudity in a scene depicting nuclear detoxification next thing you know they 'll be snipping lascivious flesh out of a documentary about auschwitz this repressive cultural environment was officially ratified on nov 2 , when ms jackson s breast pulled off its greatest coup of all the reelection of president bush or so it was decreed by the media horde that retroactively declared moral values the campaign s decisive issue and the super bowl the blue states' waterloo the political bosses of family organizations , well aware that tv s collective wisdom becomes reality whether true or not , have been emboldened ever since they are spending their political capital like drunken sailors , redoubling their demands that the bush administration marginalize gay people , stamp out sex education and turn pop culture into a continuous loop of rebecca of sunnybrook farm with today s super bowl , their crusade has scored a touchdown mtv has been replaced as halftime producer by don mischer , the goto guy for a guaranteed snoozefest his credits include the tony awards , the kennedy center honors and the 2004 democratic national convention at which the balloons failed to drop \( his subsequent cursing was heard on cnn , but escaped government sanction because no republicans were watching \) fox sports net has changed the title of its signature program best damn sports show period to best darn super bowl road show period the commercials , too , will be careful and in good taste , according to the head of marketing for anheuserbusch fox , which recently pixilated the bottom of a cartoon toddler in a rerun of the series family guy , now has someone on fulltime rearend alert it rejected a comic spot for airborne , a cold remedy , showing the backside of the 84yearold mickey rooney as he leaves a sauna this might all be laughable were the government not expanding its role as cultural cop but it is the departures of michael powell , the savonarola of the federal communications commission , and john ashcroft , whose parallel rightbreast fixation was stimulated by a statue in the justice department , are red herrings thank god he s gone , but god help us with what s next , said howard stern upon learning of mr powell s imminent exit he s right after all , l brent bozell of the parents television council condemned mr powell for four years of failed leadership in fighting indecency \( mr powell s commission had the temerity to actually reject some parents television council jeremiads , which are distinguished by their inordinate obsession with the penis \) mr bozell , whose organization has been second to none in increasing the number of annual indecency complaints from 111 in 2000 to a millionplus last year , is angling for a tougher successor and may well get one his wish has in effect been granted even before mr powell s chair is filled the second bush term began with the installation of a powerful new government censor in another big job , secretary of education margaret spellings had n't even been officially sworn into the cabinet when she took on postcards from buster , threatening pbs with decreased financing because one episode had the show s eponymous animated rabbit hobnobbing with actual lesbian moms while visiting vermont to learn how maple syrup is made though buster had in previous installments visited muslims , mormons , orthodox jews and pentecostal christians , gay couples \( even when not identified as such on camera \) are verboten to our new secretary of education many parents would not want their young children exposed to the lifestyles portrayed in this episode , ms spellings wrote in her threatening letter to pat mitchell , the ceo of pbs the letter , as it happened , was unnecessary public broadcasting says that it had decreed on its own only a few hours earlier that it would not distribute the offending show the most alarming example yet of just how cowardly it has become and how chilling the janet jackson effect has been \( since then , some two dozen member stations out of a total of 349 have rebeled and decided to broadcast the episode anyway \) but the story wo n't end with this one incident ms spellings' threats against pbs are only the latest chapter in a continuing saga at an education department that increasingly resembles an authoritarian government s ministry of information a month before the election , the los angeles times reported on its front page that the department had quietly destroyed more than 300 , 000 copies of a booklet designed for parents to help their children learn history after lynne cheney , who has no official government role , complained about its contents the booklet burning occurred under the watch of rod paige , the education secretary who , we would later learn , was simultaneously complicit in another sub rosa exercise in heavyhanded government information management the payment of 240 , 000 in taxpayers' funds to armstrong williams , a talking head and columnist , to plug bush administration policies on radio and tv mr paige fled his post last month without adequately explaining what he knew about these scandals enter ms spellings , previously a white house aide who by some accounts had been a shadow administrator of the education department during mr paige s outtolunch tenure with all the other troubles in public education , why would she focus on a single episode of a single children s program on her second day in the job \? we do n't yet know but her act was nothing if not ideologically synergistic with still another freshly uncovered bush propaganda effort just as ms spellings busted buster , two more syndicated columnists copped to receiving taxpayers' dollars , this time siphoned through the department of health and human services , to help craft propaganda for a bush healthy marriage initiative that disdains samesex couples as fervently as ms spellings did in her letter to pbs what makes this story more insidious still is the glaring reality that the most prominent republican lesbians in america are mary cheney , a former gay and lesbian marketing liaison for coors beer , and her partner , heather poe , who appeared as a couple in public and on tv during the presidential campaign that ms spellings would gratuitously go after this specific lifestyle right after taking office is so provocative it smells like payback specifically pitched at those profamily watchdogs who snarled at the mention of ms cheney s sexual orientation during the campaign whether it was by john kerry or anyone else surely ms spellings does n't believe in discrimination against nontraditional families by her own account , she was a single mother who had to park her 13yearold and 8yearold children in austin when she first went to work at the white house then again , president bush went on record last month as saying that studies have shown that the ideal is where a child is being raised by a man and a woman \( even though , as the new york times reported , there is no scientific evidence that children raised by gay couples do any worse \) that our government is now both intimidating pbs and awarding public money to pundits to enforce moral values agendas demonizing certain families is the ugliest fallout of the campaign against indecency that campaign cannot really banish salaciousness from pop culture , a rank impossibility in a market economy where red and blue customers are united in their infatuation with desperate housewives but it can create public policy that discriminates against anyone on the hit list of moral values zealots inane as it may seem that ms spellings is conducting a witch hunt against buster or that james dobson has taken aim at spongebob squarepants , there s a method to their seeming idiocy the cartoon surrogates are deliberately chosen to camouflage the harshness of their assault on nonanimated , fleshandblood people this , too , has its antecedent in the mccarthy era in his novel the amazing adventures of kavalier and clay , michael chabon was extrapolating from actual history when one of his heroes , a gay comic book artist , is hauled before congress to testify about pairing up strapping young fellows in tight trousers as superheroes a senate committee of the time did investigate the comics its guiding force was the psychiatrist fredric wertham s fearmongering 1954 tome seduction of the innocent , which posited that batman and robin could corrupt children by inducing a wish dream of two homosexuals living together the decency cops of that day , exemplified by closeted gay rightwingers like j edgar hoover and roy cohn , escalated a culture war into one with human costs by conflating homosexuality with the criminality of treason one big difference between that america and ours is that the culture industry , public broadcasting not included , has gained much more power since then should today s super bowl falter in the ratings , its creators will lure that missing audience back next year with wardrobe malfunctions that have n't even been invented yet but gay parents whose lifestyle is vilified by a cabinet officer do n't have that power they 're vulnerable even in a state like vermont that respects their civil rights i feel sick about it , karen pike of hinesburg , vt , told the burlington free press , after learning that pbs had orphaned the buster episode showing her , her partner and their three children i understand they get public funding , but they should be the one station we feel confident in , in knowing that what we see there represents our country no one had told her that some stories are no longer welcome you have to wonder if anyone has told mary cheney focus on the family could not have been pleased to read last week s new york post report that she has hired bill clinton s highpowered literary dealmaker to peddle her own story as a book

rome , april 16 the idea was so preposterous that sister christine schenk s first response was a long and resigned laugh would she and other liberal catholics have any influence in the conclave that chooses a new pope \? oh , no , not at all , sister christine , director of futurechurch , a coalition of progressive american catholics , said in a telephone interview from cleveland , where the group is based i think that is one of the difficulties with the conclave because you are a catholic and because it does n't happen very often , it feels like you are a team but to think that there is any way to influence it is a complete fantasy they may be idealists in general , but on this issue the essential irrelevance of a liberal voice in this conclave they are definite realists of the 115 cardinals taking part in the conclave , which begins on monday , almost none of them have been outspoken on matters important to the liberal wing of the catholic church , like the ordination of women , more inclusion of laity in church business or easing bans on contraception luigi de paoli , one of the founders of we are church , the largest liberal church group in europe , said his group had no cardinal inside the conclave representing its views we know some of them , and we think some of the most 'progressive' are in favor of our positions , he said but most of them are really conservative still , liberals do not seem to despair \( which is , anyway , a mortal sin for all stripes of catholics \) while questions like sexual morality do not appear to be on the table , that of collegiality allowing bishops a greater say in adapting church doctrine locally transcends the bounds of liberal and conservative and many experts believe it will be one of the major issues discussed in the conclave , and could result in more local control , a change liberals would like isaac w st , a liberal catholic activist from the netherlands , said that under pope john paul ii , and especially in his later years , decisions came from top to bottom , and no voices came from bottom to the top or at least no one was listening at the vatican , he said that is what we want to change most of all , he added like many matters facing the church , the liberalconservative divide is not clearcut some liberals make the case that the conservative viewpoint dominating the vatican and the college of cardinals does not reflect ordinary catholic life , and is one reason for declining church attendance in developed countries but conservatives note that liberals do not represent all catholics , particularly among the most devout liberal groups themselves face contradictions although they say they represent catholics around the world , their movements are based primarily in the united states and europe , where church attendance is declining in the third world , where the church is growing fastest , many catholics remain deeply conservative , especially on sexual morality but even among the cardinals , easy definitions of liberal and conservative do not always fit in the third world , many cardinals are conservative on sexual issues in latin america , many strongly oppose liberation theology , but are outspoken on poverty and social justice in italy , one strong contender for the papacy , dionigi tettamanzi , the archbishop of milan , is by most standards a conservative , especially on sexual morality , and is close to the conservative lay group opus dei but he has sympathized with antiglobalists , and is outspoken on the need to find common ground with muslims one progressive cardinal said the real divide in the college of cardinals was simply between those who favored discussing delicate topics , like bioethics or sexual morality , and those who wanted them declared settled and off limits still , several activists said they believed that the reality of the church would force some changes sister christine noted that the dire shortage of priests and seminarians would have to be confronted she said she hoped support would grow for the idea of married priests , and for allowing the ordination of women as deacons and someday priests in the long term , our faith is with the holy spirit , said linda pieczynski , spokeswoman for call to action , based in chicago , the largest catholic reform group in the united states it s not with the individual men who govern the church jesus said the spirit will always be with us , she added how else could the church have lasted for 2 , 000 years given the terrible leadership it has had at times \?
investigators in the new york attorney general s office are examining communications involving the chairman of berkshire hathaway , warren e buffett , and the chief executive of a unit of berkshire who arranged a questionable transaction with maurice r greenberg when he was chief executive of the american international group mr buffett , who has been cooperating with the inquiry , is a witness in the investigation and is not a target , according to a person briefed on the actions mr spitzer s office and the securities and exchange commission are investigating the questionable use of a product known as finite reinsurance , which can be used to make a company appear financially stronger than it really is the focus of the investigation is a transaction in late 2000 between the general re corporation , the berkshire unit , and aig , the world s leading insurance company regulators say that the transaction artificially increased aig s premium reserves , ultimately helping its stock price and its ability to acquire another company although investigators said that mr buffett was informed about the transaction with aig before it came to the attention of investigators , berkshire said in a statement yesterday that mr buffett was never briefed on the nature or the structure of the transactions with aig nor , the statement said , was mr buffett briefed on any improper use or purpose of the transactions according to one email message that mr spitzer s investigators have retrieved , ronald e ferguson , who was general re s chief executive at the time of the transaction with aig , was told that mr buffett wanted to be reassured that the deal passes the new york times test indicating that mr buffett was doublechecking on the propriety of the transaction the text of the email message was conveyed to a reporter over the telephone a spokesman for berkshire did not return a phone call or an email message yesterday seeking comment mr buffett is scheduled for an interview in new york on april 11 with investigators from mr spitzer s office , the sec , and the justice department , which is also investigating possible financial improprieties involving general re mr spitzer s office has already interviewed several of mr buffett s subordinates at berkshire the person briefed on the investigation said that mr buffett planned to use berkshire s house lawyer at the interview , not an outside lawyer , which , this person said , was consistent with a guy who does n't have anything to hide mr buffett s interview will take place a day before mr greenberg is scheduled to sit for an interview with the same group of law enforcement officials and regulators mr greenberg stepped aside as aig s chairman on monday , two weeks after mr spitzer s investigation led him to give up the chief executive s title at aig class a shares of berkshire , based in omaha , edged up 200 , or 02 percent , to 87 , 000 in trading yesterday on the new york stock exchange shares of aig , based in new york , rose 21 percent , or 118 , to 5820 mr buffett s pending interview with investigators was reported in the wall street journal yesterday the new york times reported on monday that investigators and regulators on three continents were tightening their scrutiny of berkshire and its affiliates regarding the uses and possible misuses of finite reinsurance a division of general re , based in dublin and known as the alternatives solutions group , is believed by investigators and regulators to be the source of many of the finite reinsurance transactions many companies that trade in finite reinsurance are being scrutinized by officials here and abroad , but one person briefed on the various investigations described general re as at the center of the storm insurers buy reinsurance to limit their own exposure to large claims finite reinsurance is used to soften the impact of claims that are paid out over a long period when asked last week about the investigations and mr buffett s knowledge of the transactions at issue , a berkshire spokesman cited part of the company s most recent annual report operating decisions for the various berkshire businesses are made by managers of the business units investment decisions and all other capital allocation decisions are made for berkshire and its subsidiaries by warren e buffett investigators are trying to determine the extent of mr buffett s knowledge of such deals , which remains unclear the involvement of mr ferguson , who is retired , and two other current berkshire insurance executives , ajit jain and joseph p brandon , is also unclear all three men have supervised berkshire insurance units that sold products at the core of international regulatory scrutiny none of the executives have been accused of wrongdoing berkshire reiterated yesterday in its statement that operating decisions for berkshire s different business units , like general re , are the responsibilities of the executives running those units , not mr buffett berkshire said that mr buffett speaks infrequently with all of those executives except for mr jain he , mr brandon and mr ferguson all report or reported directly to mr buffett , according to someone with direct knowledge of berkshire s operations a berkshire spokesman declined to respond to questions about the berkshire executives , their business dealings or the investigations when asked last week a unit of berkshire overseen by mr jain , national indemnity , sold finite reinsurance to a struggling australian concern , fai , in 1998 hih insurance , a large australian concern , bought fai and collapsed four years ago australian regulators contend that finite reinsurance masked fai s financial problems , contributing to the collapse regulators have said that national indemnity s deal with fai included a side letter that required fai to delay seeking payment on the policy for three years regulators consider side letters to be red flags because they mitigate the transfer of risk in a policy and essentially repackage it as a loan that adds to a company s bottom line berkshire said in its statement yesterday that a side letter was not part of national indemnity s transaction with fai but berkshire said that a side letter was part of a finite reinsurance policy general re sold to hih before it collapsed berkshire noted that the transaction was completed long before it acquired general re in december 1998 although berkshire did not acquire general re until after that transaction , mr ferguson was the unit s chief executive from 1987 to 2001 he remained general re s chairman until retiring in 2002 mr brandon , who joined general re in 1989 and became the insurer s chief financial officer in 1991 , has been the unit s chief executive since late 2001 yesterday , general re met a deadline , set by australian regulators , to say why it should not be investigated over the transactions

vice president for operations , said in an email message the airline has not made a final decision on how many workers it might hire and has no timetable for doing so , he said in response , the union s executive director , ov dellefemine , said the airline was risking a clash between striking workers and the replacements who took their jobs if they want to do it and when we ever come back , it will be a tremendous confrontation , mr dellefemine said in a telephone interview the airline s chief executive , douglas m steenland , again said that northwest may have to ask for more than the 11 billion it is seeking in wage and benefit cuts from all its unions , blaming record high prices for jet fuel and other costs the airline first made that disclosure in a securities filing last month , mr steenland said by phone from his office in eagan , minn about 4 , 430 members of the mechanics' union struck northwest early saturday over the airline s bid for 176 million in concessions , including 2 , 000 job cuts , from the mechanics in their place , the airline deployed 1 , 200 mechanics , 400 contractors and 300 supervisors , and redesigned the work done by union members so that fewer workers were employed in the first five days of the strike , 33 percent of northwest s flights were 15 minutes or more behind schedule , while the airline canceled 3 percent of its flights , according to an estimate by flightstats , a consulting firm based in portland , ore the union says the company s performance was much worse northwest said union members could still have their jobs back if they wanted to cross picket lines like the one at detroit metropolitan airport in romulus , mich , northwest s major international hub the airline says it is willing to negotiate with the union , although no talks have been held and none are scheduled on thursday , mr dellefemine said the union would not return to the bargaining table unless northwest gave it an offer that did not include job cuts declaring the replacement workers to be permanent employees would have tremendous implications for both northwest and the mechanics' union , as well as the airline industry and perhaps the entire labor movement , industry experts said the action essentially would bust the aircraft mechanics fraternal association , which has represented mechanics and other workers at northwest since 1998 but the move could backfire if it angers other unions , which until now have not honored the picket lines the issue of a lockout has been a matter of intense debate within the airline , senior company officials said thursday one reason is that mr roberts s contingency plan contains no provisions for imposing a lockout or for dealing with its inevitable fallout but northwest clearly has the right under federal law to lock out the strikers under the railway labor act , which has covered airline employees since 1936 , companies have the right to lock out striking workers as long as the company remains willing to bargain the lockout can remain in place even if negotiations subsequently resume if there is a settlement , the company must take back striking workers to replace any remaining temporary workers it must also permit striking workers to replace any permanently hired workers who have not received the training required to hold their jobs a lockout will send a message that northwest is intent on lowering costs and is willing to act decisively to do so , said philip a baggaley , an airline industry analyst at standard poor s ratings services it would tend to reinforce their message that the company needs to do it one way or another and that it could end up in bankruptcy if they ca n't do it otherwise looming over northwest and other troubled companies are changes in federal bankruptcy law that take place oct 17 , limiting the amount of time companies have to restructure lockouts like the one under discussion have been rare in the airline industry the most recent one occurred at eastern airlines , where members of the international association of machinists and aerospace workers went on strike in 1989 the strike never ended and eastern ceased flying in 1991 many companies avoid lockouts because of the public relations nightmare that can erupt and in the case of the amfa , the union could easily argue that its strikers had been thrust into dire straits in contrast to other major unions like the machinists or the united automobile workers , the mechanics' union does not have a strike fund , and it has not taken workers out on strike since 1980 the union is accepting donations on its web site , while union locals are planning fundraisers this weekend to support the strikers but officials at other unions have been short on sympathy for the mechanics' union , a rebel work group that is not part of the aflcio and has earned the wrath of rival unions over the years by persuading their members to join its ranks one senior official at a union that is not honoring the mechanics' picket lines criticized amfa for failing to permit its members to vote on northwest s last offer you have to trust the membership , the union official said especially without a strike fund , the mechanics' union should not force its members to be dependent on someone putting nickels in a paper cup , the union official said mr dellefemine rejected that assertion on thursday , saying the airline s last offer was not even worthy to take to the troops by continuing to operate this week , northwest has already beaten the union , said david gregory , a professor of labor law at st john s university in queens if the airline gets through the next week without any major problems or safety issues , he said , the strike is essentially over
your humble servant grew up as the son of two brilliant economists i studied economics at columbia university under some big names in economics , including clowell harriss when i was in law school at yale , i took classes in finance in the graduate school of economics under geniuses like james tobin , later a nobel prize winner , and henry c wallich , inventor of the fed model for when stocks or bonds are overpriced none of these people , however , taught me to be a great investor i have been a stockholder of berkshire hathaway , warren buffett s company , for more than 20 years , and i have done well with the stock but even reading mr buffett s famous annual letters to stockholders did not teach me to be a great investor for a number of years my screenplay agent was a successful investor named george diskant i have not seen him for years , but i hear that he is rich even he did not teach me to be a great investor i also read peter l bernstein s capital ideas , probably the best book about investing i have ever read besides my own , of course , written with philip demuth even that did not make me a great investor i even spent years writing for barron s about financial fraud , often with severe results for the companies i wrote about , and financial salvation for people who read the articles in time to avoid disaster nor did that make me into a great investor the fact is that i am not a great investor even now , at least in the sense that i can consistently or even often beat the broad market indexes in any meaningful way but here comes the important part hardly anyone is a great investor if you do n't count a very few hedge fund managers very , very few as well as mr buffett and a tiny handful of other professional investment managers , the people who can beat the broad market indexes consistently are like hen s teeth but if i follow a pattern of buying very broad indexes , and then dipping my toe into various other corners of the market where the action is , i do well enough to sleep at night , occasionally with a smile on my face , and i do much better than i did any other way if i hit for singles , i do a lot better in the long run than i would do by swinging for the fences , and so does everyone else or almost everyone else in fact , that is the primary lesson of mr bernstein s capital ideas and it comes to mind this month for a special reason i , your humble servant , am a frequent panelist and guest on television programs that talk about finance i happened to be sitting at morton s restaurant in beverly hills a few days ago with mr demuth and with another financial adviser for whom i have high esteem , raymond j lucia \( for whom full disclosure i am about to give a speech or two urging people to save for retirement \) ray and phil said something like this to me you know there are not a lot of shows on tv that actually teach the viewer how to be a better investor there is a lot of stock picking and predicting what ca n't be predicted , but there is not a lot that tells the ordinary joe or jane how to save for retirement ray and phil were right and they will keep being right the basic advice for being a better investor is so commonplace , and the rationale for it so complex , that it may not make for great tv drama to preach it endlessly as if it were an old anacin commercial but if followed over a long period , it is lifechanging , so i 'll give it to you now in the shortest imaginable form then , when i feel like it later in the year , i 'll go into more detail save consistently , and save as much as you can when you save money , you are saving yourself once you have a pot or as ray calls it , a bucket of liquid assets to tide you over a few rough months , move into exchangetraded funds based on broad market benchmarks these can include the standard poor s 500stock index of domestic shares morgan stanley capital international indexes like the eafe , for big companies in europe and the asiapacific region , or its benchmark index for emerging markets broader indexes like the wilshire 5000 , to capture smaller stocks' returns or large , very diversified managed funds like legg mason value trust or fidelity contrafund or invest in funds similar to these through variable annuities these annuities let the returns grow taxfree but first , check the fees and make sure you know what the fees mean fees for variable annuities can seem high , but when you know what they are for certain insurance and capital preservation features , mainly they look far more reasonable \( again , disclosure i am honorary chairman of the national retirement planning coalition , and one of the sponsors , along with medical and actuarial associations , is the association of companies that sell variable annuities \) leaven these investments in a very broad bond market index , like the lehman aggregate bond index , and add some inflationprotected bonds when you are young , you need have very little of this when you grow older , you should have an everlarger percentage of your savings in these assets , which tend to fluctuate less than stocks this preserves your capital as you become less able to replenish losses add to these investments consistently , and with as much money as you can to paraphrase an old charitable solicitation , save till it hurts unless it s the most dire of emergencies , do n't withdraw these savings and spend them let compound interest work for you by leaving your money invested do not try to beat the markets by speculating on commodities or hightech stocks an exception may be commodities embedded in broadbased funds like the ishares goldman sachs natural resources index but never bet on an individual hightech stock you may have heard touted by someone at your health club when the siren song starts to waft toward you , lash yourself to the mast of broadmarket investing buy a german shorthaired pointer or , better yet , rescue one that s the breed that won the westminster kennel club dog show this year i have owned them , or they have owned me , for 23 years , and they are the best investments i have ever made these investing ideas are basic they will not make you a george soros or a jim rogers but they will keep you from throwing yourself off a tall building in bad times they will , over time , make you a lot of money , too , even though they seem like little , cautious steps think small and you will grow big , money wise and do n't forget the hound everybody s business ben stein is a lawyer , writer , actor and economist email

houston , oct 24 gary gaetti remembers the feeling inside the metrodome in minneapolis at the 1987 world series gaetti was the third baseman for the twins , who won all four games against the st louis cardinals in the earsplitting din of the dome that was the first world series in an indoor stadium , so it was kind of a novelty , said gaetti , who is now the houston astros' hitting coach it was extremely loud we 've had very , very similar moments here where you can actually feel it on your body gaetti said he did not know if the roof at minute maid park would be closed for game 3 of the world series against the chicago white sox on tuesday night but , like seemingly all the astros , gaetti hopes it is if only the decision were that easy the astros trail in the series , two games to none , and they need every advantage they can get their game 3 starter , roy oswalt , was the most valuable player of the championship series against the cardinals but they learned monday that they might not be able to maximize their homefield advantage commissioner bud selig will make the final call on whether the roof will be open or closed pat courtney , a spokesman for the commissioner s office , said baseball would consult with the teams and make the decision based on weather conditions tuesday we just really want to have some standard procedure in place , to do what the club does regularly during the season , courtney said as a rule , the astros close the roof when the temperature is 80 degrees or higher , as it usually is during the baseball season in houston since may , there have been two games played with the roof open according to weathercom , the temperature in houston is supposed to reach only the upper 70 s with little or no threat of rain tuesday , wednesday and thursday , when games 3 and 4 , and , potentially , game 5 will be played the astros played their first postseason game at minute maid park with the roof open in 2001 , but the roof has been closed for their last 11 postseason home games the players want it to stay that way it s our field , and it works for our advantage , with the loudness of the crowd , oswalt said i do n't think they should step in and tell us what to do in our field , because it s our homefield advantage now i think chicago had their advantage there cold , windy they 've been playing in it all year we have n't so let s bring it back home and give the advantage to us now astros manager phil garner , whose wife was on the board that oversaw construction of the ballpark , objected to baseball s making the decision we 've played with it closed most of the year , i want to say about 85 percent of the time , garner said i find it strange that somebody would say we have to open it now but bottom line is , i think that with it closed , it does generate a lot of noise and it s a lot of fun we play for that excitement and that noise there is little doubt the astros enjoy an advantage at home , especially indoors including the postseason , they are 4018 with the roof closed , and 1511 with it open \( the astros also won twice in games that started with the roof closed and ended with it open \) it s interesting to see how other teams handle the noise , third baseman morgan ensberg said imagine being in your high school basketball gym when your team hits a buzzerbeater to win the game that s what it s like for nine innings astros general manager tim purpura said it would still be loud tuesday , even if the roof were open the state of texas has never played host to a world series game , and the crowd may be roaring no matter what the astros could also benefit from being so familiar with the unusual contours of their park the white sox have not played here since a springtraining exhibition series in 2003 , though some players , like scott podsednik , have national league experience as the left fielder , podsednik will play in front of a wall that is 19 feet high and 315 feet from the plate down the line during the season , the wall has space for the handoperated line scores of 16 games as a result , there are 416 squares on the wall and infinite ways for the ball to spring i do n't think you know what kind of bounce you 're going to get off the wall , podsednik said you 've got some dead spots in it , some iron poles i do n't think you can really commit one way or the other you have to be prepared for the ball to die and be prepared for it to take a weird carom center field , with its flag pole in play and its 10degree grass incline leading up to the wall , is aaron rowand s to patrol do n't be surprised if you see me do a face plant , he said of course , the way things are going for the white sox , they could be celebrating their first championship since 1917 in this funhouse on wednesday or thursday they are 91 in the postseason after winning 8 of 10 to finish the regular season while the houston fans scream , the white sox would rather whisper it the more they play this october , the more they believe this could be their time it just kind of starts adding up , first baseman paul konerko said as other teams get eliminated and you move on , i think you start believing that it s your year there s a bunch of little things that happen during the games , and the outcomes keep giving you hope that it is
winning the future a 21st century contract with america by newt gingrich 243 pp regnery publishing 2795 some folks mellow with age , others do n't newt gingrich falls in the latter category and in case you were n't clear on that , he s written a new political manifesto to drive the point home in winning the future a 21st century contract with america , you 'll find the gingrich of a decade ago , with a scope as broad as his aggression runs deep , and rhetoric with the force of a sock in the face he opens with a test , to find out where you stand on the great and growing gap between traditional american values and the secular liberalism of the left \( the capital l is his , throughout \) if you pass , you may read on , and learn to protect and defend america s traditions and values if you do n't well , he does n't quite say what happens if you do n't presumably you retreat to some redoubt deep in blue america and await your destruction and so it goes , pretty much like that , for the next 200odd pages gingrich , who now splits his time between the american enterprise institute and his own private consulting company , stood at the pinnacle of political power for only four years but what a four years ! as speaker of the house of representatives from 1994 to 1998 , he was reckless and mercurial , wrapped in an arrogance that proved his undoing but he was also possessed of political instincts and organizational ability that simply cannot be gainsaid , and may even have approached a sort of rascal s genius the 1994 republican takeover of congress grew from a confluence of events ranging from the republicanization of the south and redistricting to the whipsaw politics of bill clinton s first two years in office but gingrich shaped it and gave it a rhetoric , which he shipped off to congressional aspirants on massproduced cassette tapes like a motivational speaker democrats said he wanted to destroy the institution , not run it , evidently forgetting that creative destruction is a part of politics as well as economics yet governing with its own distinct skill set gingrich found far more difficult his contract with america the platform his house republicans ran on in 1994 was less a program than a carefully polltested string of initiatives , raised like a sail to catch the gusts of conservative fury and political malaise of the early 90 s the eight reforms the signers pledged to pass immediately were procedural changes only the 10 bills they promised to bring to a vote in their first 100 days carefully skirted the country s most contentious fiscal and social issues in favor of targeted stances like a balanced budget amendment and a ban on american troops serving under united nations command in his second act , gingrich presents himself not as a politician and bomb thrower but as a thinker , an observer with unique insights gained from experience i write these words as someone who spent 20 years in the united states house of representatives and who has made a lifelong study including a phd of history , he declares since i left government in january 1999 , i have made an indepth study of national security , health , science and technology , and the american economy i have had the unusual experience of being an academic , a leader at the center of government power , and now a student of washington using both these tools the academic and the practical yet , again , as in the transition from tactician to legislator , he seems unable or unwilling to make the leap \( just as he cannot resist not ruling out a 2008 presidential run \) as he ranges from social security to the war on terror to the nation s infestation with lawyers , misstatements and straw men burst from his keyboard like water from a fire hose just as they did , only with more effect , when he was bringing the democrats' halfcentury congressional ascendancy to its knees in gingrich s world there is none of the stark partisanship that continues to divide america roughly in half , but rather an overwhelming majority of commonsense americans battling against and losing to a tiny minority of extreme liberal secularists who lord it over everyone else , notwithstanding their exclusion from power in washington since the 1960 s , he complains in a characteristic passage , the conservative majority has been intimidated , manipulated and bullied by the liberal minority the man simply cannot wean himself from bullyboy campaign speeches and 30second television spots and in that he does himself and his ideas a disservice gingrich s discussion of immigration and citizenship , for instance , is framed around the observation that the left by which he seems to mean roughly everyone to the left of arlen specter regards national identity as irrelevant he clarifies the debate over the bush doctrine of preemption by noting that if hitler was not evil enough to justify war in the minds of the international left , we should not be surprised that coexistence with saddam hussein and kim jong il strikes them as reasonable the rehnquist court , which some find at least moderately conservative , he calls nothing but a protodictatorship of the elite pretending to still function as a supreme court and then there is the new and growing pattern among the leftliberal establishment to view foreign opinion and international organizations as more reliable and legitimate than american institutions each statement contains a grain of truth but the claims and arguments are too oversize and parodic to drill down to any challenging point the effect is of watching a grown man try to build semiconductors with a tinker toy set fun for a while , but hopelessly futile , and fairly obviously so from the start gingrich breaks from the mold in his discussions of science , the environment and , to a lesser degree , education issues that seem always to have held a genuine fascination for him here the invocations of the secular left , the leftliberal elite media and the leftliberal establishment fade away and the tone changes one might simply call it openminded reasoning rather than political attack and gingrich ends up saying very ungingrichlike things like denouncing the folly of 9 11inspired visa rules that prevent the brightest young students from coming to the united states to study and arguing for more generous research budgets and against the profoundly selfdestructive policies that have recently led to a sharp reduction in the number of american scientists traveling abroad to attend international conferences and symposiums regrettably , such moments are few and far between winning the future is difficult to distinguish from so many other political books , on the right and the left , that do nothing more than rant to the choir joshua micah marshall is the publisher of talkingpointsmemocom
hempstead , ny , july 31 ben graham is the one with no previous experience playing american football , so why are the players on the receiving end of his punts the ones looking like beginners \? several players in the jets' training camp are having a hard time cleanly handling the punts of graham , a former australian football league star from geelong he cuts across the ball when he kicks it , giving the ball a devious endoverend spin justin miller , a rookie from clemson , took his shot at fielding graham s punts sunday during the morning practice and walked off the field at hofstra university shaking his head when i first got out here , i was like , where is he kicking the ball to \? miller said it s kind of difficult to read his punts wide receiver justin mccareins has returned 51 punts in the nfl , none of which , he said , were as difficult to catch as one of graham s offerings he hooks them , mccareins said when it s spinning like that , it s going to generate movement it takes a little extra focus to catch them as opposed to a regular spiral mike westhoff , the special teams coach , said that the potential downside of kicking the ball the way graham did was that he could end up sacrificing distance but graham s left leg is so strong that he can kick a football 70 yards , and any distance he loses may be compensated for in the disquiet he will cause opponents several jets are already imagining the scene in film rooms of opposing teams should graham beat out micah knorr for the punting job even before he kicks it , people will be talking about him , mccareins said i think it will be advantageous to us , because it will be in guys' heads you 're going to be thinking about catching the ball as opposed to the return and making people miss coach herman edwards , when asked about graham , said with a laugh , he s a folk hero right now
los angeles , feb 17 rising before dawn every morning , bernard hopkins jogged the streets of miami as part of the training ritual for his fight here saturday night against howard eastman along the way , he passed homeless people sleeping on the sidewalk , drunks staggering aimlessly along the beach , latenight carousers still in the midst of partying none of south beach s temptations lured hopkins , a man whose unwavering focus has lifted him from prison to penthouses the undisputed and undaunted middleweight champion , hopkins \( 4521 \) has not lost a fight since 1993 , and a championship belt has been a proud part of his wardrobe since 1995 at the age of 40 , hopkins will make his 20th title defense against eastman \( 401 \) , a dangerous challenger who was born in guyana and lives in britain but hopkins s toughest battles have already been won growing up as a street thug in philadelphia , he was sent to the state prison in graterford , pa , for robbery at 17 , and he was not released until he was 22 while incarcerated , hopkins learned discipline , he learned survival and he learned that he wanted a meaningful life it was an education hopkins would not wish on anyone but a hardcore past helped mold the soul of a champion in a 4 , 000man prison , you have to defend and stand up for yourself , hopkins said that s the edge i have over today s boxers i'm not promoting that you go there and get the edge to be the best but part of my upbringing suits this sport like hand in glove fighting has always come naturally to hopkins as a teenager , he routinely beat up kids who were three or four years older than him , and by the time he went to prison , his ability to fight earned him respect the solitude of jail gave hopkins time to reassess his life to this day , he remembers his prison number , y4145 that was how guards addressed him , and he realized he was losing his identity to a life of crime it took me into my teens to learn my social security number , but i always knew y4145 , hopkins said that s profound i reacted to that number when i heard it on the speaker , when i had a visitor , when it was time to go in the yard , when it was time to eat y4145 was replacing bernard hopkins the day hopkins was released , a guard told him , see you when you come back but he never did after trying his hand at several odd jobs , hopkins gravitated to boxing he lost his first professional bout and was so discouraged that he did not fight again for 16 months but during that time , he met his longtime trainer , 77yearold bouie fisher hopkins and fisher found instant chemistry , and a great partnership between two philadelphians was born hopkins won his next 19 fights before losing a 12round decision to roy jones jr in 1993 but he has not lost since , and many of his fights have been onesided hopkins is a fitness fanatic who takes delicate care of the body that has helped him make millions he adheres to a strict diet , he does not drink alcohol and his weight never fluctuates far from 160 pounds nothing gets in the way of hopkins s training , not birthdays , not vacations , not even his honeymoon when he married his wife , jeanette , in 1993 , the couple went on a cruise , but hopkins still trained they feed you like crazy , and i felt bloated , hopkins said so i 'd get up and jog i still do that when i go on vacation my body tells me to do that when you 've done something for so long , it s like a subconscious reaction it s like somebody doing something bad and ca n't stop , whether it s alcohol or drugs they have a problem you can say i have a good problem part of hopkins s greatness is his versatility it is one of the main reasons he has been so good for so long he can counterpunch , he can be the aggressor , he can slug or he can be slick fisher loves to sit at home , watching hours and hours of videotapes , dissecting hopkins s next opponent when hopkins steps in the ring , he believes his opponent can do nothing to surprise him when we work out a strategy , we have a plan a , and we have three or four backup plans , fisher said and bernard can use them all never was that more evident than on sept 29 , 2001 , when hopkins scored a devastating 12thround technical knockout of the previously unbeaten felix trinidad hopkins controlled the fight from start to finish , outboxing trinidad before punishing him and stopping him in the final round his last fight was another major test , and he passed it , knocking out oscar de la hoya last september with a ninthround body shot that left de la hoya writhing on the canvas in pain perhaps de la hoya felt hopkins had slowed enough to be beaten , but hopkins s hand speed and reflexes have remained superb for a fighter his age however , hopkins can sense himself moving closer to the end of his career asked about future goals , he admitted , i am running out of them hopkins envisions two or three more major fights he would like a rematch against trinidad he may fight the unbeaten jermain taylor \( 220 \) , a talented 26yearold who will fight daniel edouard on the undercard saturday night hopkins also envisions moving up to light heavyweight to challenge glen johnson , a move that might be the final chapter of hopkins s career but first , hopkins must get past eastman , who has boldly predicted that he would knock out hopkins in five rounds other challengers have made similar statements , only to find that hopkins is nicknamed the executioner for a reason twenty years ago , nobody would have predicted that hopkins would be wealthy , respected and leading an exemplary life hopkins traded his prison number for a championship belt , and he is not ready to surrender it when it s over , i believe that eastman will respect that bernard hopkins is pound for pound , the best fighter of his era , hopkins said i'm a man who understands the difference between failure and success i 've been on both sides
for almost two decades , hiv tests had two glaring flaws they did not detect the earliest stage of infection , when people are more likely to spread the virus and they took days to produce results , and many people never returned to learn whether they were infected now , technology has put public health officials in a quandary which problem to address new generations of tests can largely eliminate either the long waiting time for results , or the failure to find early infections but the choice is pulling hiv specialists in competing directions , in new york city and nationally experts on both sides of the debate would like to see both types of tests used , but say that expense and logistics make that impractical some health agencies , including those in new york city and new york state , have embraced quick tests that produce preliminary results in minutes , rather than days north carolina and san francisco have gone another way , adopting tests that catch many early infections with hiv , the virus that causes aids , that other tests miss a group of prominent hiv doctors and researchers in new york city say north carolina and san francisco made the right call , and they are urging the city s department of health and mental hygiene to change directions nobody is criticizing the city , because they 've been very proactive on this , said dr frederick p siegal , medical director of the hiv center at st vincent s hospital manhattan in greenwich village we just think there s an even better direction we 'd like to try , or a combination of directions dr fred valentine , director of the aids research center at new york university , who is also pushing the city to switch , said , in the best of all worlds , you 'd test everybody both ways , but that would require pouring much more money into testing since the 1980 s , standard testing for hiv , the human immunodeficiency virus , has meant drawing a vial of blood and using it to perform two types of laboratory tests typically , the subject is asked to return a week later for an answer , and that has been a serious problem overall , in the united states , in public testing sites , 32 percent of the people who test positive do n't come back for their results , said dr bernard m branson , of the divisions of hiv aids prevention at the federal centers for disease control and prevention in 2002 , a test became available that can produce initial results in as little as 20 minutes , using just a drop of blood , and last year , federal regulators approved a rapid test that uses an oral swab people who test positive are still advised to have a conventional blood test for confirmation a number of state and local governments have adopted rapid testing , none more enthusiastically than new york city the city has made rapid tests the standard in its sexually transmitted disease clinics , which will perform about 50 , 000 of them this year , and it has begun using them in its jails , said dr scott kellerman , assistant health commissioner for hiv programs but rapid testing , like traditional blood tests , cannot detect the first phase of hiv infection those tests do not look for the virus itself but rather for antibodies that the immune system makes to fight the infection it takes time for the body to produce enough antibodies to be detectable dr branson and other researchers say the newest , most sensitive tests , like those used by new york city , usually find antibodies within three to four weeks of infection , though some experts caution that an estimate of a month or more might be more realistic but most government and private labs across the country still use older antibody tests that take longer to detect infection in the first weeks after infection , the virus multiplies at an astonishing rate , until the body builds up its defenses scientists say that on average , there are 1 , 000 times as many copies of hiv in the blood during that phase as there are several months later these are the most important people to find , because they have the highest viral load , which means they are most infectious , and these people are recently infected , which means they 're an active part of the highrisk sexual network , said dr jeffrey d klausner , director of sexually transmitted disease programs for san francisco some experts say that people in the first few months of infection may account for 40 percent to 50 percent of the new infections in others , but such high estimates are disputed a partial solution is to test for the rna of the virus itself , which can be detected within 10 days of infection blood banks have done this for a decade the rna test is expensive , so instead of a test on each blood sample , the samples are combined into pools of 10 to 100 most pools test negative , meaning that all the samples in the pool are negative if a pool tests positive , it is broken down into smaller groups and retested until the infected sample is found like conventional antibody testing , rna testing takes several days north carolina adopted this technique in 2003 for all publicly financed testing san francisco also made rna testing standard in its sexually transmitted disease clinic in 2003 , but it uses rapid antibody tests in other settings no other public health agencies in the united states routinely use rna testing , hiv experts say in north carolina , 4 percent of the infections found by rna tests are not detected by antibody tests , said dr christopher d pilcher , director of the testing program run by the state and the university of north carolina in san francisco , dr klausner said , the figure is 10 percent the problem of people not learning their test results is a fairly minor one in north carolina , dr pilcher said , so the state can afford to use tests that do not produce immediate results unlike states like new york , north carolina does not guarantee anonymity in hiv testing the state knows the identity of each subject , and it tracks down those who do not return for their results dr kellerman said new york city was interested in trying rna testing in the future but for now , he said , it probably does not make sense for the city the cost of rna testing in north carolina has worked out to 363 per person tested , dr pilcher said but in san francisco , where more tests are needed because there are more hivpositive results , rna testing costs around 30 per person , dr klausner said new york city would likely fall somewhere in between , with a cost for rna testing comparable to the cost of rapid antibody testing , about 10 per person
edinburgh , aug 24 peter furlong sings about suicide bombers during the day , and in the evenings he hands out fliers it s quite a contrast , said the bostonborn tenor , who is performing in manifest destiny , a new opera involving a love story and al qaeda , at the 59th edinburgh festival fringe , the largest arts festival in the world , ending here on monday for the month of august , the streets of edinburgh transform into a blurry carnival of tartan , bagpipes and streetside acts below edinburgh castle , which towers dramatically over the scene the city population more than doubles as tourists attend a variety of festivals , which , besides the fringe , include the international festival \( the original arts festival that began in 1947 , where the work is still by invitation only \) , the book festival , the film festival and the military tattoo \( a daily array of marching , drumming and fireworks \) but the major attraction is the fringe , currently 6 percent ahead of last year s recordbreaking number of tickets sold 125 million the edinburgh fringe , which began on aug 7 , overlaps with the new york international fringe festival , held during the last two weeks in august , but it is about five times larger anyone who can pay the roughly 540 registration fee is eligible \( the new york festival is juried \) , although participants must broker a deal for a performing site the sheer size more than 1 , 800 shows this year , performed almost around the clock makes standing out hard the local paper , the scotsman , prints a 24page daily festival supplement to help tourists but for some performers , nothing beats shoeleather promotion new opera at the fringe , mr furlong said , as he thrust a flier toward the clasped hands of a passerby mr furlong was competing for attention near a man covered in white chalk squatting on a toilet , a juggling unicycle rider and a 17piece band in kilts others rely on a celebrity name rain pryor billed herself in the official program guide as richard pryor s daughter for her solo autobiographical show , fried chicken and latkes , seen in new york last year for many performers , a favorable newspaper review can mean the difference between 8 and 80 people in the audience the fringe has traditionally been a place for comedy , but this year critics have griped about a dearth of outstanding talent the sunday telegraph reported that judges for the perrier award , the equivalent of an oscar for comedians , had described this year s shows as silly , ' 'flat' and 'of the level of fifthform humor , ' and complained that they concentrated too much on politics kate copstick , a comedy critic for the scotsman , dismissed the grumbles , saying , i have seen a lot more good comedy this year , though she acknowledged that even though the overall quality is better , there is less singular work that rocks my world with show titles like war , terror and other fun stuff , me and hitler and terrorist ! the musical ! it might sound as if politics was being addressed solely through spoofs but the festival s director , paul gudgin , said this year s fringe is by far the most seriously political the registration deadline was in april , so that tone came about well before the london bombings on july 7 and 21 none of the more than 30 shows about terrorism were canceled as a result , but many involved a rethinking mark ravenhill , the writer of the cult hit play shopping and , made the festival s mosthyped acting debut in product , his drama about a suicide bomber that he said he started thinking about more than a year ago then july 7 happened i knew the bombings would change things , mr ravenhill said i just did n't know how in the end , i kept it the same i 'd sanitize the play if i took things out , or emotionally hijack it if i added references to the london bombings surely the bombings change the play i'm just not sure how the british composer keith burstein similarly kept to his original concept in manifest destiny , the story of a palestinian poet who finds herself drawn to the act of suicide bombing but he did think twice about transporting one of his main props , a fake bomb made of exposed wires and cardboard tubes spraypainted gold , on the london underground i decided it best we use a taxi instead , he said other serioussounding works with titles like the exonerated , the off broadway hit , and peter morris s ironically titled guardians , about abu ghraib and the news media , were praised by critics and audiences alike the exonerated , the strongestselling american show at the fringe there are about 40 tells the reallife stories of six people , including a woman named sunny jacobs , who were wrongfully convicted of crimes and spent years on death row when , at the end of one performance , the actor aidan quinn , who was in the show , announced that the actor playing sunny jacobs was the real sunny jacobs , the crowd at the assembly at queen s hall space jumped to its feet in a standing ovation each time i perform , i reopen old wounds that are better left healed , said ms jacobs , a quiet , grayhaired woman but if i can help generate interest in the show , then i will help out where i can with the fringe operating as a kind of department store and the shows as merchandise , the idea , of course , is to be purchased there are 1 , 359 registered producers and others here on scouting missions wesley o brustad , the president of the state theater in new brunswick , nj , is one such scout who arrived looking for fresh , new , nonrecycled talent in four days , mr brustad saw 32 shows short taxi rides between performing spaces helped and said he hoped to bring a fringe act to new jersey next year edinburgh is one of the great secrets , he said it s so bizarre and fun here , like nothing i ever thought artistically , it is mindblowing quirky often helps entice scouts , and this year several works are being presented at unusual sites homemade is a homedelivery theater troupe that comes to you the backers of ren sa , an art installation influenced by japanese horror films , drive the audience to an unknown location in a rental van with blackened windows lila on the wall by edward allan baker , a new york playwright , challenges audiences to join a squabbling cast on location in an alley for his part , mr furlong , the singer , said he had found that the best promotional tactics were the traditional ones only a quarter of passersby accept his fliers , he said , but he is sharpening his strategy he has started saying new opera at the fringe with an exaggerated italian accent and a touch of vibrato i think it s helping , he said correction august 29 , 2005 , monday an article in the arts on thursday about the edinburgh festival fringe misstated the birthplace of peter furlong , a tenor who is performing there it is framingham , mass , not boston
los angeles , oct 12 like any adoring fan , ali macgraw went to some lengths to meet her idol last week , the actress left her home in santa fe , nm , and flew to los angeles , where she dressed in a flowing white tunic and leggings and painted a tiny gold dot on her forehead , all in preparation for meeting the man she has admired for more than a decade the indian yogi bks iyengar mr iyengar , 86 , the author of 14 books , including the groundbreaking 1966 manual light on yoga , is widely regarded as the greatest living yoga teacher mr iyengar was making his first visit to the united states in 12 years , including a stop in new york this friday , traveling from his home in pune , india , to promote his new book , light on life \( rodale books \) i 've studied yoga for 15 years but i 've never met him , so this is a very big deal , ms macgraw said during a reception for mr iyengar last wednesday at the university of california at los angeles earlier in the evening , she had introduced the man she affectionately calls guruji \( a sanskrit term of endearment \) to a capacity crowd at ucla s royce hall that had gathered to hear him speak about his book with the actress annette bening , another longtime yoga student ms macgraw and ms bening are only two of the thousands who have turned out to pay their respects to mr iyengar , a whitehaired but incredibly supple grandfather who is credited with transforming a centuriesold eastern mystical discipline into a global phenomenon practiced by nearly 16 million americans , according to the latest yoga journal survey mr iyengar was one of the first yogis to leave india and teach in the west , starting in the 1950 s he is also one of the most prolific and penetrating writers on the subject light on yoga remains the bestselling yoga book ever published , translated into 17 languages this month , mr iyengar embarked on a sixcity author tour that he has said will be his last visit to the united states at soldout speaking engagements in los angeles , boston and colorado , he has been received with the kind of adulation reserved for the dalai lama or jk rowling on friday , mr iyengar is scheduled to appear at a soldout event at city center in new york , sign books at borders books at columbus circle and dine at the home of the designer donna karan the outpouring of attention has proved almost overwhelming at times for mr iyengar , who retired from active teaching two years ago he leads a relatively quiet life at home in india , where he lives with two of his six children at the ramamani iyengar memorial yoga institute , which he founded in 1975 in honor of his late wife , ramamani his devotees' affection is beyond my expectation , mr iyengar said last week over a vegetarian lunch at the private home in beverly hills where he was staying during his visit to los angeles it has moved me a great deal that kind of devoted fan base does not go unnoticed by publishers two years ago , when word began circulating that mr iyengar planned to write his fourth major book , the final installment of the fourvolume light series that began with light on yoga , rodale books made a preemptive sevenfigure bid like his other books , light on life is rich in yoga philosophy and methodology but unlike his previous writings , this new book is full of rich in autobiographical anecdotes , chronicling his life from his illnessplagued childhood to the racism he encountered in britain and the united states in the early 1950 s as a struggling young yogi and the challenges he faced when his wife died in 1973 after 30 years of marriage yogis should be examples , he said i struggled hard , and many people may be having the same feelings i was undergoing so why should i not give out so they know the truth , so they also get the courage \? mr iyengar was barefoot indoors , as is his custom , but was otherwise elegantly dressed in a white cotton tunic and a yellow silk dhoti , the skirtlike garment he favors his long white hair was brushed back , and the red stripe signifying the completion of his morning prayers was drawn on his forehead although he can appear fierce , even forbidding , he has an impish , ready laugh and a quick wit that befits a man who can still perform a full backbend and stand on his head unsupported by a wall for more than an hour my friend , if the body collapses , the mind cannot hold on , he said , smiling broadly , when asked about his daily fivehour yoga practice i am doing with sheer willpower to maintain both body and mind that formidable will percolates through light on life the 11th of 13 children born to a poor rural family , mr iyengar was afflicted with many illnesses as a child , including typhoid , malaria and tuberculosis three of his siblings died , and when he was 9 he saw his father die of appendicitis yoga , he said , saved my life i took it for my health , and then i took it as a mission he brought a similar sense of purpose when it came to writing he decided to write light on yoga because he felt all the yoga books at the time were cheating , as he said i saw a lot of those books , and they would write one thing about the positions and show another in the photos , he said , adding that he spent years writing and working closely with a photographer to shoot almost 4 , 000 photographs of himself in various poses in writing light on life , he chose to use certain events from his life rather than photographs to illustrate the lifelong struggle one undergoes in the study and practice of yoga mr iyengar plans to donate all the profits from light on life to continuing his support of his native village of bellur , near bangalore through a trust he started with royalties from light on yoga , mr iyengar has paid for the construction of schools , a water and sewage system , a community hall and a yoga center a junior college , an outpatient hospital and a program for local cottage industries are in the works that trust , along with his books , will be his legacy , he says at 86 he will turn 87 in december he is not unmindful of his own death i am leaving everything for posterity , as a guide for generations to come , he said if they read my books , their confidence will grow so that none can shake them
i am not a listmaking person there is a list of reasons , but i'm not about to make it something eludes me in the 1 2 3 of it , the a b c of it i have known a few great listmakers , among them my stepmother she used to keep a daily record in the form of penciled lists on a neatly folded square of paper it accorded almost exactly with my sense of her character not a moment was to be wasted and the best way not to waste a moment was to map out the day ahead as if she were keeping a ship s log of the immediate future i suppose i would be much more productive if i made more lists , as long as being productive means making more lists but the philosophical difference between making lists of things that need doing and actually doing them is simply too immense for me my incapacity may have something to do with being a writer when i put words on paper , i have actually done something it is my work the idea of putting words on paper that would cause me to do some other kind of work seems , if anything , counterproductive when i do make lists , there is usually only one reason it is to figure out which item on my list is the thing that s keeping me from getting all the other things done i think of this as a cuttothechase list somewhere in the column of things i need to do is the one thing i have secretly been worrying about , the one that arouses a sickening mixture of guilt and anxiety it could be calling the accountant or going to the dentist or answering the email i should have answered a month ago the ultimate cuttothechase list is , of course , the one that none of us really bothers to write down 1 age , 2 die december , of course , is the season of lists , when the enormous , interlaced construct of our culture collapses into a pile of top tens , top dozens and top hundreds call it filtration if you like technically , these are not todo lists their imperative content is low take , for instance , the new york times book review s list of 100 notable books , a survey of the best reading of the past year by people who knew all along that they would have to come up with a list at the end of it it is recommended reading , not required reading then why do i feel the notable books list nagging at me \? perhaps it s the hundredness of it there s a lot to be said for topone lists but it s also the feeling that i'm steadily losing ground against the swell of highly recommended contemporaneousness i 've read x of the books on this list and have another x in a pile by my desk i'm looking forward to reading them but over the years i 've collected any number of reading lists from the times and many other sources i have entire lifetimes of recommended reading stacked up in list form i'm not gaining ground on those lists either everywhere you turn this time of year you find lists that offer to pull the calendar year into hierarchical perspective it s bad enough in the conventional media but in blogland as on amazoncom the list is king the very notion of a blog is built , in some sense , on selfindexing on chronicling the ins and outs of information , keeping the archives on top and transparent , making the past , as well as the present , immediately available this is a recipe for endless endofyear listmaking , some of it happily idiosyncratic , but much of it merely daunting late last month , for instance , information leafblower released its collaborative list of the 40 best bands in america i consider it a personal triumph that i have actually heard of 20 of them but i can feel the waters closing over me the only recourse is to pursue your eclectic , ecumenical way , disregarding , as best you can , the confetti of cultural advice that flutters down from the rooftops this time of year it is the blizzard of immediacy , the hurricane of advocacy i went to the movies in times square the other night , and as i was coming out of the theater i passed an electronic kiosk displaying entertainment weekly s list of 20 things we like at least i think it was 20 there was nothing random in that list , of course , since it is a form of paid advertising but it s only a single step from a kiosk like that to a billboardsize list of lists constantly flickering in times square , an endless stream of things we like and notable books and bestofs glowing on high an electronic sinai awaiting its moses , who would come down from it with the top ten commandments in hand
why is the mayor of new york city grinning so much these days \? as members of the international olympic committee arrive this week to inspect the city s bid to play host to the 2012 games , they punctuate what has been a recent series of tough political news cycles for mayor michael r bloomberg there is no stadium deal for the mayor s guests to peruse he recently lost the endorsement of the queens county republicans and his response to a gay marriage ruling earlier this month seems to have pleased no one with the city s five to one democratic voterregistration advantage and mr bloomberg s mediocre poll numbers , the incumbent should be in no mood to smile in addition , fitting neatly into the democrat s negative message frame is mr bloomberg s largely unpopular plan to build a stadium complex on the west side , an enterprise viewed by many as a bridge too far and a distraction from addressing the everyday problems of real new yorkers yet , instead of exhibiting gleeful anticipation at the prospect of taking back an office not held since 1993 , many local democrats are projecting an image of despair , one mirrored conversely by the nonchalant confidence and celebratory mood of mr bloomberg and his advisers national democrats are concerned , too after all , it s not just any office we are talking about here the battle to sleep in gracie mansion \( or at least have that option \) is one of the nation s most closely watched weathervane races of 2005 the winner fills what often is called the secondmost important political job in america each of the four democrats running in the party s september primary is a distinguished public servant , any of whom no doubt would make the fall contest close but close does n't count and at this moment , mr bloomberg is the heavy favorite to keep his mod corner office some of the reasons are obvious some are not money no potential democratic opponent seems to be in a position to come close to parity with the mayor s campaign bank account mr bloomberg s advisers wo n't say what he is willing to spend , but here is a guess whatever it takes to win media mogul membership michael bloomberg was and is a media magnate some of the city s newspapers , whose reports drive television coverage and affect voter opinion , are also run by news barons while a large cast of independent people determine the news and editorial direction of these papers , will the owners be tempted to grant the benefit of the doubt to one of their own \? the democratic message no positive democratic programmatic and poetic vision of how to better govern the city , derived from experience in public service , has yet appeared in any speech , press conference or ny1 news appearance the negative message the outoftouch mayor who makes the wrong choices because he does n't understand people like you \( read nonbillionaires \) may be worth some mileage , but will it be enough for voters to fire the guy who managed the city s recent fiscal crisis with relatively little pain \? the post9 11 mayoralty at some point , the democratic nominee will have to square his or her shoulders and promise , i will keep you safer than mike bloomberg but none of the current candidates boast impressive national security credentials or an air of gravitas for new york city voters , national security is a major part of the job description if you do n't buy that , study the 2004 presidential election results throughout the five boroughs president bush significantly improved his vote totals from 2000 partisanship try as the democrats might to make the r in mr bloomberg s name stand for republican rather than rubens , the proguncontrol , prochoice , progaymarriage metarepublican mayor is n't all that scary to democratic voters democratic primary politics none of the democratic candidates have been in a citywide general election and , therefore , faced the pressure of intense scrutiny or the fallout from wellplaced opposition research team bloomberg will be laying in wait with plenty of negative research to fill the days between the september primary and the november election race and big labor mr bloomberg is not a lightning rod like rudolph w giuliani and beyond nonwhite support , the mayor will also make a play for union backing both from individual members and maybe from one or more historically democratic unions of course , this is gotham city , where voters are fickle , haughty , savvy and unwilling to suffer political fools gladly anything can happen in one of those famous new york minutes , but , for the moment mr bloomberg can keep smiling the city david chalian and mark halperin cover politics for abc news and are writers of abcnewscom s daily political digest , the note
even punk rockers pierced , leathered and wearing flamed mohawks get sentimental ever since the news broke last summer that the legendary rock club cbgb was about to close , the nostalgia setting on east village guitar amps has been cranked to 11 and the region s rock fans have found themselves awash in benefit concerts and fond remembrances of punks of the distant past , like television , the ramones and patti smith but when the fanfare fades and the lights finally dim at cbgb , at 315 bowery on the lower east side , the region s lovers of underground music will still have maxwell s , a club so new york that it s in new jersey sitting at 1039 washington street , on a reasonably quiet corner in hoboken , maxwell s opened its doors in 1978 , too late to catch the punks who swept through cbgb , but just in time to play host to the next wave of great independent rock bands and , to be honest , the bookings at maxwell s have outclassed those at cbgb for a long time while cbgb continues to tread water , maxwell s has had bands like brian jonestown massacre , the db s , black mountain and the waco brothers in the last month with the minutemen , we stopped there almost every tour , mike watt , the band s bass player , said of maxwell s in a phone interview in the early 1980 s , when bands like the minutemen and their sst label mates h \? r d \? isscrossed the country in kneestochin vans , they often played cbgb and maxwell s on backtoback nights but maxwell s came with an added bonus since it was also a restaurant , bands were guaranteed a meal no small promise for a group just hoping to make enough money at the door to gas up the van it was good chow , too , mr watt said none of that beer food they had a fullon kitchen with the club firmly established as a place to play , a stream of important bands began to flow through to follow the club s bookings is to sketch the arc of independent rock in the last quarter century by the late 1980 s , maxwell s had played host to the pixies and even nirvana , who appeared there in 1989 before they broke in with nevermind in 1991 in the 1990 s , the club became a regular stop for a new wave of indie rockers who traced their musical lineage and ethos to the postpunk bands of the previous decade , the likes of pavement , built to spill and neutral milk hotel and while cbgb s roster of acts flagged , maxwell s brought in breaking groups like the walkmen or the folkinfluenced iron and wine to packed houses it s a remarkable run , unbroken but for two years in the late 1990 s when new owners turned the restaurant into a microbrewery it did n't take the club was sold back to experienced hands , and the music since has equaled , if not topped , the club s 1980 s heyday i think by staying the course and avoiding trends , musical and otherwise , we have managed to keep on keepin' on , said todd abramson , one of maxwell s owners decades of satisfied concertgoers can thank mr abramson s unusual longevity for the music business he has booked maxwell s bands since 1986 , just after bruce springsteen featured it in his music video for glory days for about one straight year after that , the place was packed on every weekend , mr abramson said over the decades , the club has grown from a weekendsonly hangout to a top club that books national acts and stages shows six nights a week , on average mr abramson has also presided over a long tradition of great new jersey bands making the club their own , staking out their turf against the touring acts legendary locals like the feelies made a point of playing maxwell s on holidays , and yo la tengo recently began a tradition of performing on each of the eight nights of hanukkah some of the most exciting shows of the last year have featured the wrens , longtime new jersey favorites who scored a national success with their 2003 album the meadowlands there s a vibe that we get from playing there , said charles bissell , the band s lead guitarist and singer it s a combination of knowing that it s local , that it stands head to head with any of the new york clubs of comparable size new yorkers know this , too , and they keep flowing across the hudson on weekends , it s not uncommon for more than half the crowd at maxwell s to hail from out of state \( the performance space in the back holds 200 and the dining area another 50 \) they 're packed in two deep against the bar or bathed in the warm glow of the brick walls and ornate tin ceiling in the dining area the rattle and clank of forks and knives competes with al green or the new pornographers pulsing from the jukebox in between acts , concertgoers wander out and mingle with bar patrons , or stare at the old cigarette machine in the foyer , or linger at the stairs to the basement dressing room , hoping to encounter a favorite band member the waiters and waitresses pass in and out of the kitchen at a breezy pace , looking impossibly cool that essential hipness sets maxwell s apart from hoboken s meatmarket dance clubs and rowdy pubs maxwell s gets its share of hoboken regulars , but you may also still spot someone with a mohawk or a halfdozen visible tattoos there s comfort in that consistency , though maxwell s has changed some over the years with ticket sales moving partly online , shows now sell out quicker than ever and a television set has recently popped up in the secluded front room , glowing ominously but it has also kept its quirks , perhaps most notably its layout with the stage tucked into the back and no backstage area nearby , bands have nowhere to go at the end of their sets but straight into the applauding crowd , sometimes only to turn around and wade back to play an encore it s a charmingly personal touch that speaks volumes about the club s enduring character lots of places burn out , or the people burn out , said mr watt of the minutemen but maxwell s keeps on chugging photos at maxwell s in hoboken , you can trace the arc of three decades of independent rock matt raimo and the dudes of doom played there late last month \( photographs by norman y lono for the new york times \)
on a friday afternoon in late september , with the nation riveted on hurricane rita , the new york city department of education quietly released the hehir report , an independent evaluation of the city s special education system the city paid a team of experts led by thomas hehir of harvard 350 , 000 to find out how the mayor s 2003 reorganization of a longtroubled special ed system one that serves 154 , 000 students was doing from the city s news release , things sounded terrific the release quoted the first finding in the 116page report , that mayor michael r bloomberg s reorganization is moving new york city in the right direction a statement by chancellor joel i klein said that while much hard work remains , the findings were gratifying and showed that our reforms are working for our children the release noted that special ed test scores were at record levels we 've come a long way , carmen farina , the deputy chancellor , testified at a city council hearing on oct 7 she emphasized that 2 , 600 teachers had been trained in wilson , a phonics program for children struggling with the mechanics of reading , and that 500 new computers had been provided to psychologists to speed services for children time to celebrate \? not for anyone who looked beyond the news release for example , while 206 percent of special ed fourth graders scored proficient in reading on the 2005 state test , up by 5 percentage points in 2004 , only 41 percent of special ed eighth graders scored proficient in reading , down from 44 percent the year before at the hearing , when councilwoman eva moskowitz asked if the deputy chancellor agreed with the report s criticisms , dr farina , in a quieter voice , answered yes that is sobering the first two pages of findings detail improvements under mr bloomberg the next 69 pages discuss what s wrong and needs fixing the mayor and the chancellor have a reputation as firstrate managers , and a centerpiece of their 2003 reorganization was streamlining the bureaucracy from 37 district offices to 10 regions , with the freedup manpower going to support principals but the report found the reorganization created a new bureaucracy with confusing roles and responsibilities and limited support for principals it described a bottleneck of resources at the regional level and a failure to implement change at the school level the report said principals were constantly in crisis mode according to one interviewee , there s an anger on the part of principals in that , 'we have to do it now and they did n't teach us' it s just too much , too fast with not enough support in the business world , where the mayor made his billions , he is known for technological innovation but in the three years that he has controlled the schools , his administration has relied on a 20yearold special ed computer system described as a disaster data is so unreliable , a recent audit found , that 28 percent of special ed students did not attend the schools listed for them instead of email messages , paper records travel between the school and regional office via a courier system that makes one delivery a week highly paid administrative staff at the central , regional and school levels report spending a good deal of their time locating records , the report said a dysfunctional bureaucracy and unreliable data impact children the report praised the city for expanding a collaborative teaching model that integrates up to 10 special ed students with 15 general ed students in a classroom with one special ed and one general ed teacher but because there is little support and training for teachers , the classes are often so poorly run , the report said , that teachers and parents of general ed students are reluctant to participate , and classes become a dumping ground for the lowesttracked children the report does not name schools , but it is not hard to find examples lisa wilson is a kindergarten teacher at public school 75 in manhattan and the building s union rep at the start of last year , she said , 12 children with serious disabilities a heart ailment , a stroke , one who was not toilet trained and several with emotional problems were split between two kindergarten classes instead of a special ed teacher for each class , a firstyear special ed teacher , who arrived a week after school began , had to divide her time between the two classes , ms wilson said all year , she said , you could hear kids screaming and running out of those rooms she said some parents withdrew their children and all three teachers left at year s end at the hearing , two members of the city council , gale a brewer and domenic m recchia jr , asked for more resources for collaborative classes it s on our radar screen , dr farina said what s the timing of that radar screen \? ms brewer asked i 'd like to think by the end of this year , dr farina said collaborative teachers are supposed to be trained by regional instruction specialists , but too often , the report said , those positions are left vacant the specialists are supposed to work at half a dozen schools , the report said , but were assigned up to 14 it s like you put a bandaid here and you run over to the next person , put another bandaid , one told the hehir team in response , city officials said they would adjust the regional bureaucracy , and spend 30 million on a new special ed computer system and 8 million to train teachers the report noted cases where the mayor s and the chancellor s inability to work out compromises has hurt the schools it pointed out that too many of parents' request for services wind up in legal hearings 13 percent more than under the previous chancellor this delays the child s services , is costly and the city usually does such a poor job defending its position that it loses anyway , the report said city officials said they would hire more lawyers and install a computer system to better track cases , but ms moskowitz said that misses the point that this administration needs to be more collaborative as chairwoman of the council s education committee , she has been one of the few checks on the school system under mayoral control and said it was often a battle getting information and sometimes required a subpoena while ms moskowitz endorsed the mayor for reelection this week , she said , there is an arrogance and refusal to listen that causes them problems when the mayor announced his special ed reorganization in 2003 , he pledged , we will no longer tolerate a largely segregated system that unmercifully ravages the lives and future of our children but when dawn easparro of brooklyn tried to get her son matt , 9 , out of a school for the emotionally disturbed last year , she never would have succeeded , she said , without a lawyer from advocates for children in first and second grade , matt had behavior problems and needed the p771k school by third grade , she said , thanks to medication and therapy , his behavior had improved but he could n't read , she said at a school meeting a year ago , she said , teachers said that matt s reading was fine but afterward , a counselor pulled her aside and suggested she have the boy privately tested in december , tests paid for by ms easparro showed matt was severely dyslexic armed with those tests , ms easparro attended another school meeting in march , and this time , she said , the staff agreed that matt needed a phonics program like wilson , but there was none available while the city said it has trained 2 , 600 teachers , advocates say demand far exceeds the supply ms easparro s lawyer filed for a hearing in august , the hearing officer ordered that matt be placed in a regular school , get a wilson program and that the city pay for extra tutoring to compensate for the year of lost services stephen morello , a spokesman for the department of education , said that for privacy reasons , he could not comment but , he added , we will never be satisfied when there are delays in connecting students with services matt loves ps 100 , his mother said he has a regular notebook with dividers for science and language arts like a regular kid , she said at the other school he 'd get a couple of handout sheets the teacher called friday to say he s doing wonderful he s doing cursive on the board and word bingo ms easparro said the city has good special ed programs , but you must fight for them they 're definitely not handing this stuff out , she said on education email edmike nytimescom

monk quartet with john coltrane , found at the library of congress in january the library made the announcement this month the tapes come from a concert at carnegie hall on nov 29 , 1957 , a benefit for a community center the concert was recorded by the voice of america , the international broadcasting service , and the tapes also include sets by the dizzy gillespie orchestra , ray charles with a backing sextet , the zoot sims quartet with chet baker , and the sonny rollins trio \( newspaper accounts of the concert indicate that billie holiday appeared as well , though she is not on the voice of america tapes \) but it is monk with coltrane that constitutes the real find that band existed for only six months in 1957 , mostly through long and celebrated runs at the east village club the five spot during this period , coltrane fully collected himself as an improviser , challenged by monk and the discipline of his unusual harmonic sense thus began the 10year sprint during which he changed jazz completely , before his death in 1967 the monk quartet with coltrane did record three numbers in a studio in 1957 , but remarkably little material , and only with fairly low audiencetape fidelity , is known to exist from the five spot engagement the eight and a half monk performances found at the library of congress , by contrast , are professionally recorded , strong and clear you can hear the full dimensions of shadow wilson s drum kit and ahmed abdulmalik s bass it is certainly good enough for commercial release , though none has yet been negotiated on the tapes , monk is monk , his pianistic style basically formed at least 10 years before , with its sudden drawls and rhythmic hesitations he lets coltrane solo at length with very little accompaniment the saxophonist plays rows and rows of original licks and runs , built with blizzards of 16th notes the notable exception is coltrane s solo on blue monk through 10 blues choruses , he builds an even crescendo of logic , letting down his guard and relying less on his stock phrases \( the other songs on the tape , from the evening s two sets , are monk s mood , evidence , crepuscule with nellie , nutty , epistrophy , byeya , sweet and lovely and a truncated second version of epistrophy \) the music was discovered by accident , during the routine practice of transferring tape from the library of congress s voice of america collection to digital sound files for preservation larry appelbaum , a studio engineer , supervisor and jazz specialist at the library , said that he was given a batch of about 100 tapes for digitization one day in january and looked to see what was there among them he noticed a brown cardboard box for a 7 1 2inch reel , marked in pencil sp event 11 29 57 carnegie jazz concert \( 1 \) , with no names on it it piqued his interest , and one of the boxes holding the carnegie tapes there were eight in all said t monk it got my heart racing , mr appelbaum said \( none of the tape boxes mentioned coltrane \) no bootleg recordings of the concert are known to exist , because even though it was recorded , it was not broadcast the coltrane specialist lewis porter knew of the tape s possible existence and inquired about it years ago , but after an initial search yielded nothing , mr appelbaum said , he forgot about it completely he was surprised to finally find it , of course , but his sense of surprise has been worn down over the years there s always more , mr appelbaum said sagely , in a recent interview in his recording laboratory at the library of congress s recorded sound division he repeated the phrase so often during the afternoon that it became a mantra the library of congress holds the country s largest collection of sound recordings , and jazz of course forms only a tiny part of it the full extent of several essential collections is thoroughly cataloged they include everything ever recorded at the library s coolidge auditorium , including ts eliot , robert frost and robert lowell reading their work , chamber music performances by the budapest string quartet , and jelly roll morton singing and spieling for eight hours in 1938 all of john and alan lomax s famous field recordings are kept there as well but among the collections still being cataloged are the 50 , 000 voice of america tapes , which for 40 years have been housed in a dark , climatecontrolled room the tapes constitute a valuable history of radio , and of music in new york \( the voice of america also recorded every newport jazz festival from 1955 , its second year , to 1976 , four years after the festival relocated from rhode island to new york city \) the cataloging has proceeded gradually , with first priority given to the most historically important and most physically fragile material michael gray , librarian and archivist at the voice of america , which still operates out of washington , confirms that in 1957 , and for a long time after that , the broadcast service had access to the carnegie hall recording company s services the voice of america was allowed to record performances at carnegie hall free of charge , without paying the hall or the musicians , as long as it broadcast only overseas this was regarded as public diplomacy through music of course , some musicians would not consent to be recorded , which is probably why there is no billie holiday on the tape besides satisfying jazz fans , the discovery of the monk tape has gino francesconi , carnegie hall s archivist since 1986 , excited by the idea that much more of the hall s past may be preserved than he thought we knew that voice of america recorded here , he said but we did n't have any formal documentation of it , and it s fantastic to know that they 've discovered this there s always more
white plains , july 15 westchester county health officials said on friday that the number of patients who had contracted legionnaires' disease at sound shore medical center had climbed to 12 , and they urged anyone with strong flulike symptoms who had been in the vicinity of the hospital to have a medical examination sound shore , a 400bed hospital in new rochelle , started to see cases of the disease in late june and identified an outdoor cooling tower near the entrance to its outpatient unit as the source of the bacterial infection , which is sometimes deadly the tower , which tested clean for legionnaires' in may , has since been decontaminated , said sal schiliro , a spokesman for the hospital still , county health officials said the number of cases could continue to rise because the incubation period for the disease is 2 to 10 days and possibly longer , according to mary landrigan , a spokeswoman for the county s department of health several patients who were scheduled to be treated at the outpatient unit canceled their appointments on friday after learning of the outbreak , mr schiliro said many others called with questions i personally fielded 50 calls from concerned citizens people who were at the hospital over the past week , he said so far , none of the patients have become critically ill six have been treated and released , while another six are hospitalized and in stable condition the case in westchester follows a small but fatal outbreak of legionnaires' disease in april at newyorkpresbyterian hospital columbia university medical center in manhattan two patients died in that outbreak ms landrigan said most of the patients with legionnaires' in westchester had been outpatients at sound shore , but a few were residents in the neighborhood who came close to the cooling tower ranging in age from 34 to 83 , all the sufferers had underlying medical conditions and weakened immune systems , which predisposed them to contracting the disease , she said the cooling tower , which provides central airconditioning to the hospital , is enclosed by a large fence about 50 feet from the ambulatory care unit s entrance on washington avenue the tower emits a fine mist , and the victims most likely inhaled the vapor while entering or leaving the outpatient unit or otherwise passing by the tower , county health officials said preliminary tests on samples of the water from the tower came back positive for legionella bacteria , mr schiliro said but the dangerous bacteria had not been dispersed inside the hospital , he added officials said the recent heat and humidity may have promoted the growth of the legionella patients who use the ambulatory care unit are usually seen for routine procedures like colonoscopies and pain management , mr schiliro said the hospital is asking anyone who was near the medical center to seek medical care if they experience severe flulike symptoms typical of legionnaires' disease
it was once rare to name a tournament after a living player the havana international tournament of 1913 , though , was held to celebrate jos raul capablanca s great career , even though he played in the event it was perhaps the only time he lost to frank marshall , who proceeded to win the competition once again a player has been immortalized even while he is still competing the sixth karpov tournament was held in russia from feb 26 to march 6 to the glory of anatoly karpov , who is not only still alive , but still active although he had the wisdom to watch from the sidelines it was a round robin of 10 of today s best players the winners , in a tie , were etienne bacrot and viktor bologan , who scored 63 , followed by alexander grischuk and aleksei dreyev , with 5 1 23 1 2 grischuk s only loss was to bacrot , who used a skill pioneered by capablanca for dealing with bishops of opposite colors bacrot opened lines for passed pawns , spread them far apart and tied the enemy king down svetozar gligoric notes in his book on the nimzoindian defense that 4 g3 was once the accepted move , but that first playing 4 nf3 reached prominence when garry kasparov used it to defeat karpov in the 1985 world championship match the first time i ever saw it was in a grau fine game in 1935 that went 4 g3 bc3 5 bc 00 6 bg2 d6 7 nf3 nc6 8 00 na5 9 qd3 qe7 with about even play the routine blocking move 4 c5 gets ready to double the c pawns but after a slew of exchanges , ending in 13 bc , there are no doubled pawns on the board on the queenside there are four isolated pawns , and bacrot has the bishop pair after 14 rfd1 be2 15 c4 bd1 16 rd1 qc7 17 cd cd , bacrot would have had a slight material superiority after 17 qb4 , it would not have been a good idea for grischuk to exchange queens and patch up the white queenside pawns after 18 bf4 , bacrot had a slightly better grip on the queen bishop and queen files it is a question whether grischuk should have advanced 18 c5 it denies the d4 square to the white pieces , but is more vulnerable after 23 be6 24 qb6 bh3 25 qg6 , would not 25 hg give black a better pawn formation \? grischuk now has three isolated pawns , and bacrot is ready to demonstrate that , bishops of opposite color or not , he has good winning chances after 39 ke3 , bacrot has two passed pawns , grischuk none after 61 c6 , grischuk gave up at 61 ke8 , then 62 kd6 bf3 63 kc7 be4 64 kb6 bd5 65 c7 be6 66 kb7 will queen a pawn and it s all over
in june 2003 , dick ebersol bet 2 billion of nbc s money on the 2010 and 2012 olympics part of his strategy was a hope that one of the two would be staged in north america a month later , he got his wish the international olympic committee selected vancouver , british columbia , as the host city for the 2010 winter games but there was a hiccup and a tightening of the muscles when we heard how close it was , ebersol , the chairman of nbc universal sports , said yesterday by telephone from martha s vineyard in massachusetts in the first round of voting that day in prague , the big surprise was pyeongchang , south korea , which received 51 votes to vancouver s 40 and salzburg s 16 in the second round , with salzburg , austria , eliminated , vancouver won with 56 votes to pyeongchang s 53 as the ioc prepared to choose a host city for 2012 in singapore this morning , nbc was faced with a set of circumstances that broke its way there was no candidate in asia , where the time zone difference would dampen ratings as occurred in 2000 in sydney , australia , and will almost certainly affect nbc in 2008 in beijing and the other candidates were from the united states and europe at the time of our bid , all five cities were known , and we studied carefully the possibilities of '10 or '12 , ebersol said back then , rome , havana , istanbul and leipzig , germany , were also in the 2012 fray an olympics in new york would generate the most viewers \( the toprated ones since the freakish height of the tonyanancy games in 1994 in lillehammer , norway , were in atlanta and in salt lake city \) paris , the presumptive favorite heading into the election , london , madrid and moscow rounded out the 2012 field , and european cities attract the secondhighest viewership in the united states if we end up where we can televise live from new york , then , sure , it s a nice little advantage , but all four european cities are major metropolitan areas , ebersol said there are no issues with hotels or television infrastructure , and over the years , we 've done programs from all four if new york won , nbc would be headquartered at the international broadcast center in willets point , near the new stadium in queens that would be downsized to become a new home for the mets nbc has committed to pay 820 million for the vancouver games and 118 billion the most for an olympics for the 2012 games another 190 million will come from general electric , nbc s parent company , whose global olympic sponsorship will start next year at the winter olympics in turin , italy , and continue through the 2012 \( pick your city \) games the total investment of nearly 22 billion from nbc and ge far exceeded the 13 billion bid by fox and the revenuesharing offer by abc and espn the primary difference to viewers between a new york and a european olympics would be that the former would have a lot of live events in prime time , the latter little or none but the debate over what s live and what s not was largely mitigated last year when nbc vastly expanded its coverage from athens far beyond its broadcast network to cnbc , msnbc , usa , bravo and telemundo in all , the seven networks carried 1 , 210 hours and reached 203 million viewers no matter where the olympics will be in 2012 , more than half will be live across all platforms , but it s just what prime time will be , ebersol said the main sports swimming , gymnastics and track we 'll hold them in some form for prime time because that s where the audience will be ebersol said that in addition to the television networks that will carry the 2012 games , there will most likely be a wireless component and an expanded internet site even if nbc universal acquires any other networks , there is no guarantee that they would carry the olympics we 've come close to maxing out on the numbers of sports that are interesting to the television viewer , ebersol said the contest to become the 2012 host is the first olympic event since ebersol sustained serious injuries in the private jet crash in november in montrose , colo , that killed his youngest son , teddy , and injured his eldest , charlie his recovery ensured that ebersol would produce the turin games in february , his sixth since becoming the head of nbc sports in 1989 turin is the fourth of five that he and nbc acquired in a twopart buying binge in 1995 that cost 35 billion let s say that my eagerness for february to come is enormous , he said but with the addition of the nfl deal , i'm excited about what exists in front of me and all of us between torino and beijing the 2012 games which will be staged when ebersol is 65 is the last that nbc has the rights to carry , which does not preclude deals before then
after years of telling athletes to drink as much liquid as possible to avoid dehydration , some doctors are now saying that drinking too much during intense exercise poses a far greater health risk an increasing number of athletes marathon runners , triathletes and even hikers in the grand canyon are severely diluting their blood by drinking too much water or too many sports drinks , with some falling gravely ill and even dying , the doctors say new research on runners in the boston marathon , published today in the new england journal of medicine , confirms the problem and shows how serious it is the research involved 488 runners in the 2002 marathon the runners gave blood samples before and after the race while most were fine , 13 percent of them or 62 drank so much that they had hyponatremia , or abnormally low blood sodium levels three had levels so low that they were in danger of dying the runners who developed the problem tended to be slower , taking more than four hours to finish the course that gave them plenty of time to drink copious amounts of liquid and drink they did , an average of three liters , or about 13 cups of water or of a sports drink , so much that they actually gained weight during the race the risks to athletes from drinking too much liquid have worried doctors and race directors for several years as more slow runners entered long races , doctors began seeing athletes stumbling into medical tents , nauseated , groggy , barely coherent and with their blood severely diluted some died on the spot in 2003 , usa track field , the national governing body for track and field , longdistance running and race walking , changed its guidelines to warn against the practice marathon doctors say the new study offers the first documentation of the problem before this study , we suspected there was a problem , said dr marvin adner , the medical director of the boston marathon , which is next monday but this proves it hyponatremia is entirely preventable , dr adner and others said during intense exercise the kidneys cannot excrete excess water as people keep drinking , the extra water moves into their cells , including brain cells the engorged brain cells , with no room to expand , press against the skull and can compress the brain stem , which controls vital functions like breathing the result can be fatal but the marathon runners were simply following what has long been the conventional advice given to athletes avoid dehydration at all costs drink ahead of your thirst , was the mantra doctors and sports drink companies made dehydration a medical illness that was to be feared , said dr tim noakes , a hyponatremia expert at the university of cape town everyone becomes dehydrated when they race , dr noakes said but i have not found one death in an athlete from dehydration in a competitive race in the whole history of running not one not even a case of illness on the other hand , he said , he knows of people who have sickened and died from drinking too much hyponatremia can be treated , dr noakes said a small volume of a highly concentrated salt solution is given intravenously and can save a patient s life by pulling water out of swollen brain cells but , he said , doctors and emergency workers often assume that the problem is dehydration and give intravenous fluids , sometimes killing the patient he and others advise testing the salt concentration of the athlete s blood before treatment for their part , runners can estimate how much they should drink by weighing themselves before and after long training runs to see how much they lose and thus how much water they should replace but they can also follow what dr paul d thompson calls a rough rule of thumb dr thompson , a cardiologist at hartford hospital in connecticut and a marathon runner , advises runners to drink while they are moving if you stop and drink a couple of cups , you are overdoing it , he said dr adner said athletes also should be careful after a race do n't start chugging down water , he said instead , he advised runners to wait until they began to urinate , a sign the body is no longer retaining water the paper s lead author , dr christopher sd almond , of children s hospital , said he first heard of hyponatremia in 2001 when a cyclist drank so much on a ride from new york to boston that she had a seizure she eventually recovered dr almond and his colleagues decided to investigate how prevalent hyponatremia really was until recently , the condition was all but unheard of because endurance events like marathons and triathlons were populated almost entirely by fast athletes who did not have time to drink too much elite athletes are not drinking much , and they never have , dr noakes said the lead female marathon runner in the athens olympics , running in 97degree heat drank just 30 seconds of the entire race in the 2002 boston marathon , said dr arthur siegel , of the boston marathon s medical team and the chief of internal medicine at harvard s mclean hospital in belmont , mass , the hyponatremia problem hit us like a cannon shot in 2002 that year , a 28yearold woman reached heartbreak hill , at mile 20 , after five hours of running and drinking sports drinks she struggled to the top feeling terrible and assuming she was dehydrated , she chugged 16 ounces of the liquid she collapsed within minutes , dr siegel said she was later declared brain dead her blood sodium level was dangerously low , at 113 micromoles per liter of blood \( hyponatremia starts at sodium levels below 135 micromoles , when brain swelling can cause confusion and grogginess levels below 120 can be fatal \) no one has died since in the boston marathon , but there have been near misses there , with 7 cases of hyponatremia in 2003 and 11 last year , and deaths elsewhere , dr siegel said he added that those were just the cases among runners who came to medical tents seeking help in a letter , also in the journal , doctors describe 14 runners in the 2003 london marathon with hyponatremia who waited more than four hours on average before going to a hospital some were lucid after the race , but none remembered completing it that sort of delay worries dr siegel the bottom line is , it s a very prevalent problem out there , and crossing the edge from being dazed and confused to having a seizure is very tricky and can happen very , very fast , he said boston marathon directors want to educate runners not to drink so much , dr siegel said they also suggest that runners write their weights on their bibs at the start of the race if they feel ill , they could be weighed again anyone who gains weight almost certainly has hyponatremia instead of waiting until they collapse and then testing their sodium , maybe we can nip it in the bud , dr siegel said correction april 20 , 2005 , wednesday a frontpage article on thursday about a danger to athletes from drinking too much water misstated the standard unit of measurement for sodium in blood it is millimoles per liter , not micromoles
benny binion , the man who created the world series of poker 35 years ago , was born lester ben binion in pilot grove , tex , in 1904 he spent his youth punching cattle , trading horses and sitting on the fringes of card games starting with 56 he saved in the depression , he began his own numbers racket , a kind of neighborhood lottery , netting 800 his first week in business from numbers he branched into dice , running craps games in the shadow of the dallas courthouse for , among others , h l hunt and howard hughes i was never a real good poker player , binion told a biographer , contrasting himself with friends who made a living at the game they know the cards , and know the percentages , and somebody can have a hand , and all this money in he continued they got to know how many cards is gone , and how many chances he s got to make it , and this , that and the other i ca n't do that i do n't know that end of it what he did know was how to create a secure , seductive home for games of skill and chance , and to take a fair cut for his trouble since gambling was illegal in texas , binion and his fellow racketeers had to police both themselves and their clients , and without courts or prisons , their principal means of enforcement was violence by nearly every report , binion was a warmhearted family man who happened to savor his reputation as a coldblooded killer there s no way in the world i 'd harm anybody for any amount of money , he told a biographer near the end of his life , after certain statutes of limitation , and not a few of his enemies , had expired but if anybody goes to talkin' about doin' me bodily harm , or my family bodily harm , i'm very capable , thank god , of really takin' care of 'em in a most artistic way and i'm still very capable i do n't have to hire nobody to do none of my dirty work that sounds a little bit like braggin' , but if they do n't think that i can do it , well , just let 'em come on in his dallas heyday , binion was targeted for hits by his competition and prosecuted by the government on a regular basis the cumulative heat became so intense that he decided to get out of texas my sheriff got beat in the election , was how , tongue in cheek , he explained it in 1946 he piled his wife , their five children and 2 million in cash into his maroon cadillac and drove to las vegas , where most of his games were legal by 1951 he had taken over the el dorado casino on fremont street and renamed it binion s horseshoe a few years later , binion pleaded guilty to tax evasion and drove back to dallas with a satchel full of cash to persuade the judge not to impose jail time he had reason to believe a 100 , 000 bribe would do the job , but the judge wound up sentencing him to four and a half years in leavenworth binion claimed he could have beaten the rap if he had n't been tricked into pleading guilty , adding , i got tricked all the way around by the government upon his return to las vegas , he took to wearing a white 10gallon stetson cocked to the side like a gunfighter s when cheaters or burglars were caught in the horseshoe , security guards did not call the police they administered their own brand of frontier justice , from which at least seven of the accused never managed to recover to safeguard his delicate legal and political privileges , binion is said to have paid off senators , governors , judges and beat cops in 1978 , he boasted of having delivered the vote of senator howard cannon on the panama canal zone treaty to president jimmy carter as his sons , jack and ted , gradually took over casino operations , binion came to prefer the kitchens as his bailiwick his motto was good food cheap , good whiskey cheap and a good gamble he also insisted on cleanliness my kitchens get dirty , he threatened with weirdly draconian logic , i 'll call the health department they 'll straighten 'em up pretty quick all beef served at horseshoe restaurants came from binion s ranch in montana , though gamier selections also appeared on the menu t j cloutier recalled that binion always had some oddball item in the players' buffet line buffalo steak , rattlesnake , bear meat , this and that and the main courses were never repeated during the series binion told a university of nevada oral historian , mary ellen glass , in 1973 , this poker game here gets us a lot of attention and he was n't exaggerating seven thousand stories about the world series of poker had appeared that year alone in newspapers and magazines yet binion was just getting started we had 7 players last year , and this year we had 13 , he said i look to have better than 20 next year it s even liable to get up to be 50 , might get up to be more than that he paused , gazing beyond glass for a moment it will eventually this year s championship drew 5 , 619 , a number that must have remained unimaginable when binion died on christmas day in 1989 amarillo slim preston proposed an epitaph for his friend he was either the gentlest bad guy or the baddest good guy you 'd ever seen whatever one might think of that assessment , there is certainly no individual who raised the profile and stakes of our national card game more than lester ben binion
i have some reservations about discussing the whole issue of timesselect here first , because i had no role in the decisionmaking , which was a matter for company executives and , second , because it seems a bit petty to debate times policy instead of larger issues like , for example , genocide in darfur but so much of my mail is coming from readers who are furious with me and the times that i think it s appropriate to air it here s a typical complaint you say that 50 bucks in a year isn t much i m sure that it isn t to you , but to all the college students and young people starting out on their own that read your writing and who have been inspired by it , it is a significant amount of money i m an americorps member , and i don t get paid much i slight myself a bit on groceries to afford the luxury of the internet your column was one of the main reasons i was willing to make that trade off it s hard to find 50 when i m eating cheerios and peanut butter sandwiches for many of my meals your paper is slighting the very people they should be seeking to serve , and your kowtowing to the sulzbergers on this is both simpleminded and disingenuous of you this point is further illustrated in the developing world as i m sure you know from your travels , media in the developing world really sucks good opinions are hard to find but the internet version of the times s oped s and your blog offered free ideas and critical thinking for wide dissemination many people talk of the times as now being a national paper i think both you and your owners editors are missing the extent to which it is a global paper even those in the developing world who can pay for internet access most likely can t pay 50 for a few dozens essays per week it s just impossible for them to justify to themselves , and it s impossible for you and your paper to justify to your readers i m sympathetic to two points here first that we ll lose influence and readers everywhere , and second that in the developing world , most people don t have credit cards let alone the money to pay for timesselect i want readers in china , india and pakistan , and i ve gotten a lot of emails from people in countries like that who say that now they ll be cut off but remember something else companies have to pay their bills in the old days , we did that by selling papers \( for about onethird of revenue \) and advertising \( for about twothirds \) then the web came along , and the paper provided the content free but that in turn risks nibbling away at the other two sources of revenue so this newspaper and others have to figure out ways of getting revenue to stay alive advertising on the web brought in some money , and timesselect may or may not be a successful model of how newspapers can help finance themselves in the future but we need a new business model , and this may be part of it in short , charging for web access may be good strategy or bad strategy , and it certainly has a downside , but i entirely disagree with readers who think this is an immoral strategy look , the paper has to make money it has to pay for my trips to darfur and , right now , for my trip to the gulf of mexico \( note to the accountants i m staying at a private home in gulfport , miss , which will save hotel expenses \) and the newspaper industry is hurting , along with this paper , in part because of the migration to the web the times announced this week that it will cut 500 jobs so it s not that the times is wantonly inflicting pain on others we re feeling it right in our newsroom as well i wish that times content were free , not least because i m sad at losing a lot of readers but i also wish that medical care were free , and that food were free in the end , none of my wishes may be realistic

london , july 10 the subway tunnel between king s cross and russell square is one of several deep tubes bored through london s bedrock and clay more than a century ago 70 feet down , 12 feet in diameter and reinforced with iron rings , the singletrack tunnel s walls have just inches of clearance for trains on thursday , the tunnel contained and intensified the impact of a bomb containing about 10 pounds of high explosives , sending its force punching through the cars like a blast down the barrel of a shotgun it was the deadliest of the four bomb blasts in london last week in the days since then , dozens of recovery workers in heavy , white protective suits have gone in time and again , entering a nightmarish scene of mangled remains , twisted metal and hellish temperatures and even an infestation of aggressive rats crammed tight against the walls and wreckage , the men have crawled carefully , inches at a time , to avoid disturbing evidence while they try to recover body parts by late sunday , they pulled out the last of the visible remains of the 49 people known to have died in the bombings but even then their job was not finished the police say more remains might be obscured , because some people may have been blown out the front of the train and then run over as it skidded to a halt we have taken out all of the bodies we can see , deputy chief constable andy trotter of the british transport police said during an interview outside king s cross station , but given that the blast was downward as well as sideways , there could still be bodies underneath the train above ground , the salvation army and other groups keep watch for the workers as they emerge , looking for signs of stress and grief and offering help and as the job has stretched on , many of the workers have been ordered to take time out for counseling , preparing them for the strain of going back down the tunnel has made the recovery work far more difficult than at the other blast sites , in the shallower subway lines built as broad trenches and then covered over recovery workers are now trying to crawl under the cars from a smaller tunnel opening beside the train the bomb exploded in the lead car moments after the train pulled out of the king s cross station and headed south toward russell square , blowing apart the car and making it impossible to reach the dead and wounded from the rear recovery teams have had to work from the russell square station , ferrying people and equipment in and human remains out more than a third of a mile on a batteryoperated trolley recently built for use in the tunnels in case of a chemical attack at least 21 people died on the train , which was packed with about 1 , 000 passengers the last of those bodies was taken out of the russell square station entrance behind the british museum late sunday and driven away in a large white truck marked recovery large screens of plastic sheeting , at either end of the block where the recovery teams work , shield the site from public view mr trotter , the deputy chief constable of the transport police , said one thing hampering the recovery was the heat and stillness of the air temperatures are still around 120 degrees , kept hot by intense lights , heavy equipment and lingering heat from the blast the tunnel has been sealed at either end of the accident site to stop the stench from the bodies from leaking into the other subway lines that meet at king s cross station no natural air is getting to them , he said , adding that the crews working in the tunnel were wearing heavy boots , gloves , helmets as well as face masks because of the risk of asbestos particles in the air from the train s brakes environmental specialists are monitoring the air to ensure it is safe for the recovery teams it s very hot and very dusty and extremely grim , he said the police located 21 bodies in the car within hours of the blast , but the difficulty in reaching them without disturbing possible forensic evidence has slowed their removal he said dozens of body recovery experts and forensic specialists were involved in the operation , taking swabs for explosives residue and poring over the wreckage for scraps of bomb parts before removing bodies one transit official who asked not to be identified said that the tunnel , which is below the water table , was damp and infested with rats , adding to the awfulness of the scene most of the recovery experts , including some foreigners , had recently worked in thailand or sri lanka in the aftermath of the asian tsunami , mr trotter said but because of the cramped quarters , he said , only a handful could work on the site at any one time all 49 people confirmed dead are in the city s temporary mortuary , at an unidentified military site in central london but none of the dead have been formally identified the police have sent at least 57 specially trained officers to work with the families and friends of people likely to have died they have begun collecting dna and other forensic material , such as hair from hairbrushes , latent fingerprints on household items and dental records while many bodies are in a condition that makes it possible for them to be identified by family members , formal identification is a slow , multistage process established by the coroner and police , mr trotter said the work of identifying the bodies started saturday afternoon , but the police say it could take weeks to identify them all because some victims suffered extensive trauma and others were blown to pieces the bomb is believed to have been left on the floor of the subway car , and transport policemen said people closest to the bomb lost legs complicating the identification process is the task of matching limbs with the dead or with the living who lost arms or legs and are recovering mr trotter declined to be more specific about the condition of the bodies recovered you can imagine , he said , adding that he did not want to say more because people missing loved ones would hang on every word i do n't want to say something that they will play over and over in their heads for the rest of their lives , he said i do n't want to add to their misery above the bomb site , visitors continued to leave bouquets of flowers in a fencedoff corner outside the imposing brownbrick pile of king s cross station , hedged in by busy streets and businesses the site is watched over by nicholas wheeler , a parish priest he said he was praying at nearby st pancras parish church when the bomb went off , and he went to the station to provide solace to the emerging survivors and later to the rescue teams many of the firemen and police were very young , and it was their first experience with something so horrific , he said they went down with an amazing sense of courage and came up having seen things you would not wish anyone to see
apple says its ipod music player and itunes music store have 74 and 85 percent of their worldwide markets but according to gene munster , a piper jaffray analyst , the end is near nobody can sustain an 80 percent market share in a consumer electronics business for more than two or three years , mr munster told cnn it s pretty much impossible well , he s right about one thing apple s market share wo n't stay at 80 percent it s about to go up if you doubt it , then you have n't yet handled the ipod nano a tiny , flat , shiny wafer of powerful sound that apple unveiled last week beware , however to see one is to want one if you hope to resist , lash your credit card to your wallet like odysseus to the mast some music players contain a tiny hard drive , offering huge capacity others store music on memory chips , which permit a much more compact design \( this type is known as a flashmemory player , or flash for short \) what s so clever about the ipod nano \( 249 \) is that it merges these two approaches it contains memory chips , so it s dazzlingly tiny 35 by 16 by 027 inches , to be exact , about the size of a folded playing card and thin enough to slip under a door yet because apple stuffed it with four gigabytes of memory , it holds as much music as some harddrive players more than 1 , 000 songs \( apple also offers a 199 model with half the capacity \) because it contains no moving parts , the nano is less delicate than fullsize ipods and virtually skipproof to sweeten the deal , apple endowed the nano with a sharp color screen \( 176 by 132 pixels , 15 inches diagonal \) , the better to show off albumcover art , your photo collection and the ipod s famously clean menu system the nano even has room for a click wheel , the scrolling device that makes ipod navigation simple even when you 're hunting for a musical needle in a haystack of albums the resulting slab is sweet , small and shiny , a comfortable fit in the middle third of your palm it weighs so little \( 15 ounces \) , you do n't have to worry about dropping it onto pavement even if it flies from your hands , the earbud cord catches it like a leash once again , apple has mastered a lesson that its rivals seem unable to absorb that the three most important features in a personal music player are style , style and style apple is so confident in the nano s appeal , in fact , that it has decided to make room in the product line by discontinuing the world s bestselling player , the ipod mini that s a gutsy move , because the nano is n't really the same thing the mini , for example , was available in four metallic colors the nano comes only in shiny black or white \( both have the traditional fingerprintprone chrome back panel and both come with earbuds in the traditional statussymbol color , which pc magazine wittily calls mugme white \) the mini held much more music , too 200 for four gigabytes of storage instead of two , for example the nano s battery does n't last as long , either 14 hours instead of the mini s 18 , and rival flash players' batteries run much longer still and the nano ca n't connect to your mac or pc with a firewire cable , as all previous ipods could \( except the shuffle \) instead , the nano comes with a snowwhite usb cable if your computer has a usb 20 jack , filling up your nano takes about the same time as a firewire cable would for example , 700 songs and 1 , 200 photos take about nine minutes to transfer from your computer on the very first sync but if your computer has only a regular usb 11 connector \( and this includes macs that are only two years old \) , you could practically sing your songs in the time it takes to transfer them to the nano finally , as much as the nano may look like a scale model of the original ipod , it lacks some familiar features it can display photos on its postagestamp screen , but ca n't connect to a tv for showing off to the masses , as the big ipods can none of the current ipod microphones , remote controls or digital camera phototransfer adapters work on the nano , which lacks the necessary jacks \( the nano does have a standard ipod docking connector , however , so you can still use ipod speakers , chargers and some fmradio car transmitters \) but even though apple taketh away , apple also giveth the nano offers a raft of features never before seen in an ipod a world clock shows you what time it is in several cities of your choice the elegant new digital stopwatch , complete with lap counter , is a natural enhancement on a gadget whose fan club includes an awful lot of joggers and gym members and if you 've caught nosy coworkers toying with your 'pod once too often , you can now lock them out with a fourdigit password like other ipods , the new one is designed to synchronize its audio material with the free itunes jukebox software for mac and windows it handles songs copied from your own cd collection , songs you 've bought from apple s online music store , audio books from audiblecom , and any of 15 , 000 free weekly podcasts \( wildly uneven , and wildly entertaining , amateur radio shows \) but only the nano identifies , with a blue dot , the podcasts you have n't yet listened to , and only the nano can display the lyrics of whatever song is now playing \( that trick requires you to install the new 50 version of itunes and paste the lyrics in yourself \) most ipods have long been able to keep your address book and calendar synched with your computer if it s a mac but thanks to itunes 50 , the nano and other ipods can import this information automatically from microsoft outlook or outlook express on a windows pc some critics have complained that the nano s headphone jack is on the bottom edge , not the top that particular invention s mother may have been necessity as it is , you wonder how apple crammed so many components into a machine the size of a gum wrapper but it turns out to be a blessing in a couple of situations first , when you extract the ipod from your pocket , you no longer have to flip it around to see its screen and controls second , apple offers a pricey but extremely convenient accessory called lanyard headphones \( 39 \) a simple , tanglefree way to both wear and hear your ipod while you walk , work out or drive because the nano hangs upsidedown from the lanyard , the text on the screen is upright when you glance down at your stomach the nano will not come as good news to the growing membership of the curmudgeon club people who resent the ipod s success \( 22 million sold so far \) and its trendiness they 're fond of declaring that other players offer more features for less money in this case , however , they 'll have a tough time want to know what happens when you pit other players against the nano , mano a mano \? you give up , because no other flash player on the market offers anything close to the nano s concept or capacity twogigabyte flash players are rare as hen s teeth in the united states , and rival fourgigabyte models are nonexistent \( one gigabyte is generally the maximum \) color screens are uncommon on flash players , too samsung and iriver each make one , but they 're a lot bigger , uglier and less capacious so are the analysts right that the sun will soon set on the ipod age \? the truth is , the ipod has faced stiff competition from some of the industry s bestknown companies since the day it was introduced yet even after four years , all of dell s horses and all sony s men have n't made a dent in the ipod s dominance and with the introduction of gorgeous , functional and elegant ipod nano , that s not about to change david pogue email pogue nytimescom

jackson , miss , nov 19 when the federal government and the nation s largest disaster relief group reached out a helping hand after hurricane katrina blew through here , tens of thousands of people grabbed it but in giving out 62 million in aid , the federal emergency management agency and the american red cross overlooked a critical fact the storm was hardly catastrophic here , 160 miles from the coast the only damage sustained by most of the nearly 30 , 000 households receiving aid was spoiled food in the freezer the fact that at least some relief money has gone to those perceived as greedy , not needy , has set off recriminations in this poor , historic capital where the payments of up to 2 , 358 set off spending sprees on jewelry , guns and electronics though a majority of the money appears to have been given out legally , the united states attorney s office is investigating at least 1 , 000 reports of fraud , including accusations that people lied about claims of damage or where they lived state and local officials are criticizing fema and the red cross as doling out money without safeguards , but they also blame their fellow citizens the donors all across this nation thought they were giving money to put food in the mouths of people who had nothing and clothes on the backs of people who had lost everything , said state representative john r reeves , who represents jackson but that is not what happened here there was a feeding frenzy free money was being handed out and friends have turned against friends when word of the red cross and federal money got out in jackson s neighborhoods , many rushed to apply huge lines formed at western union outlets , discount stores and other places that issued or cashed the relief checks erica thompson , 32 , tried unsuccessfully to persuade her friends not to join in people can take a good thing and abuse it , ms thompson said while doing her wash at a coin laundry in jackson this week it s not right some of those who accepted the aid , though , feel no embarrassment i needed that money , said lynn alexander , 30 , whose apartment lost power in the storm , but was not damaged she collected 900 , she said , from the red cross it helped me put gas in my car , wash my clothes and buy food what happened in jackson and its suburbs in hinds , madison and rankin counties might not be unique emergency officials elsewhere in mississippi and in parts of louisiana have also questioned how so much federal aid could have been authorized , given the limited damage they documented someone is going to have to look at that , said bo boudreaux , deputy director of homeland security in iberia parish , west of new orleans , where perhaps three mobile homes were damaged , he said , but 404 families , according to fema , received 2 , 000 checks in emergency aid fema , which is leading the 62 billion hurricane katrina relief effort , has been criticized as responding slowly to the disaster and then wasting recovery money in defending the payments in the jackson area , the agency and the red cross cited the tensions between moving quickly to help the desperate , and moving carefully to avoid aiding the undeserving this is the challenge we perpetually face , said nicol andrews , a fema spokeswoman do you get assistance into the hands of those who desperately need it as quickly as possible \? or do you slow it down to dot every single i and cross every single t \? we chose to err on the side of the victim charles d connor , a senior vice president at the red cross in washington , said his group had a similar imperative people who brought in a form of identification were eligible for aid mr connor acknowledges that apparently resulted in aid being offered to some who did not need it we did the best we could to help people as quickly as we could knowing that mistakes would be made along the way , he said friday donald paxton , executive director of the central mississippi chapter of the red cross added unless you drove down every street in hinds county , there was no way of immediately determining actually what the damage was fema and the red cross have made disaster assistance payments in the past that have drawn criticism after hurricane frances in florida last year , fema distributed 31 million to residents in the miamidade area despite minimal damage senator susan m collins , a maine republican whose committee oversees fema and the department of homeland security , said in an interview thursday that the agency had apparently failed to correct problems auditors found in florida it is frustrating to me that fema seems incapable of paying legitimate claims quickly and effectively and yet reimburses fraudulent claims without asking any questions , ms collins said it is the worst of all worlds open for aid after hurricane katrina devastated coastal communities on aug 29 , it moved steadily inland toward jackson smack in the middle of mississippi , the capital city has been in slow decline for more than a decade , struggling with high crime , longsimmering racial tensions and poverty by the time the hurricane reached this far , its power had diminished the sustained winds , recorded at 47 mph at the airport , were far below hurricane speed but gusts of up to 74 mph took down trees , knocking out power lines and damaging roofs almost all of jackson lost power electricity returned for most customers in a few days but in some cases , it took up to two weeks still , the region was largely spared in jackson and two nearby counties , only 50 to 60 homes were declared uninhabitable , local emergency departments said about 4 , 000 sustained damage , they said immediately after hurricane katrina made landfall , the bush administration declared a disaster area along 15 mississippi coastal counties , as well as 31 parishes in louisiana residents there were eligible for federal emergency grants , housing assistance and money for repairs , medical bills and other costs but by sept 7 , at mississippi s request , the disaster zone was expanded as far as 220 miles inland , reaching 32 counties , including several that never experienced sustained hurricaneforce winds the zone eventually reached 47 counties the disaster area in mississippi which is led by gov haley barbour , a republican ally of president bush s extends 200 miles farther north than that in louisiana , which is led by gov kathleen babineaux blanco , a democrat who at times criticized the federal storm response lea stokes , a spokeswoman for the mississippi emergency management agency , said it was the course of the storm , not politics , that dictated the map the state urged the bush administration to include so many counties in the disaster zone after documenting widespread damage the state encouraged all residents to apply for aid , even if the only cost they incurred was the purchase of a chainsaw or generator let them tell you whether or not you qualify before you rule yourself out , ms stokes said , echoing the advice offered by mississippi officials ms andrews , the fema spokeswoman , said the federal government typically deferred to states on disaster declarations but when that happens , she acknowledged , the door is opened for federal aid once we effectively turn on a county , anyone in that county can apply , ms andrews said and the red cross , mr connor said , followed the federal lead , authorizing aid for jackson just as it did for residents of new orleans a rush for checks even before hurricane katrina landed , the central mississippi chapterof the american red cross began preparing the charity opened a shelter at the coliseum and trade mart in jackson for evacuees from the coast soon after , the red cross also began offering cash grants ranging from 360 for a single adult to 1 , 565 for a family of five ms alexander , who is unemployed , remembers phone calls from her cousin , then from her therapist the red cross , she was told , was giving out money to jackson residents ms alexander drove to the trade mart , but chose not to wait for her turn because the crowd was so large back home , she called the charity s tollfree telephone number dozens of times before finally getting approval for 900 in aid she had to give her name and address , she said the only storm damage at her apartment was spoiled food in the fridge i was blessed , she said michael hendrick had also gone to the trade mart , broke , homeless and hungry after fleeing the louisiana coast he listened as jacksonarea residents plotted the best way to get the biggest grants it was really kind of turning my stomach , mr hendrick said before the rush subsided , the red cross gave 32 million to area residents , including about 25 , 400 of the 92 , 000 households in hinds county , home to jackson , according to statistics first published in the clarion ledger and confirmed by mr paxton of the local red cross chapter fema received 42 , 313 applications from hinds county and 17 , 352 claims from madison or rankin counties to date , 16 , 407 of those applications have been approved , resulting in a payout of 203 million in disaster grants , as well as 9 million in rental assistance and other aid , agency records show most of the federal money was intended for people whose homes were uninhabitable , but it was distributed before any home inspections were conducted the relief checks soon created a crush of customers at local businesses a clerk at quik cash , a checkcashing store , said a line of more than 100 customers stretched down the hallway , out the door and around the corner so many people showed up that the business ran out of cash lee montgomery , the manager of terry road pawn shop in jackson , said many of those cashing relief checks at his business immediately bought jewelry , firearms , dvd movies and electronics bob parks , owner of a hinds county pharmacy and western union agency , said he watched in disbelief as hundreds of jacksonarea residents arrived at his store to get relief checks surely the red cross has to have a better use of funds , mr parks said unless they just have money that they are trying to get rid of for some reason unexpected numbers local government officials were baffled by the payouts weeks after the storm , larry j fisher , director of the hinds county emergency department , got a call from a regional fema representative saying that staff members wanted to know why county officials had reported that so few homes were uninhabitable fema has sent aid to thousands of county residents who claimed their homes were ruined , including 7 , 622 checks for 2 , 000 in emergency financial assistance but mr fisher counted only about 50 uninhabitable homes and perhaps 4 , 000 with any damage at all to resolve the discrepancy , mr fisher recalled , he was told you are going to increase your number a baptist deacon and a former city police detective , mr fisher , 67 , was going to have none of that backed up by digital photographs he had taken of damaged properties , he refused to revise his reports i am not going to change my figures up to yours , mr fisher said he told the fema official you want to start investigating , by all means , do so when asked about the conversation , fema officials said they were not aware of it officials in mississippi fault both the red cross and fema for not having clearer and tougher standards about what kind of damage merited a claim in the end , it appeared that simply being a resident when the storm passed through was enough to collect a check mr paxton said he realized that there was some abuse , but he could not say for sure just how much took place if the charity failed to act responsibly , he said , it will move to correct the problems already , mr connor said , the charity has stopped monetary aid in jackson unless losses are documented marshand k crisler , president of the jackson city council , said many aid applicants perhaps honestly believed they deserved help , even if it was simply to replace spoiled food but clearly there was abuse as well people are taking advantage of a crisis , mr crisler said we are saddened that people would stoop to such a level
defense secretary donald h rumsfeld said that while political obstacles had stymied nicaragua s pledge to destroy its arsenal of portable antiaircraft missiles he had received assurances this week that the remaining arms were being properly secured he has been pressing the nicaraguan government for more than a year to eliminate all of the shoulderfired missiles supplied by the soviet union and cuba during the 1980 s , weapons that terrorist groups might use to down commercial airliners so far , nicaragua has destroyed about half of its 2 , 000 missiles , pentagon officials say , but none since february , when the national assembly , dominated by opponents of president enrique bola \? stripped him of the authority to dispose of the weapons unilaterally progress has been made , mr rumsfeld said at a news conference in key biscayne , fla , to conclude a twoday meeting with central american defense and security ministers eric schmitt \( nyt \)
hartford , march 17 federal prosecutors said thursday that former gov john g rowland should serve at least 30 months in prison , twice what they had originally suggested , because he deceived a probation officer about his financial condition since resigning from office the prosecutors said mr rowland had failed to disclose a retirement account worth more than 416 , 000 and a friend s promise of college scholarships for two of mr rowland s children mr rowland s lawyer , william f dow iii , said his client had disclosed the retirement account in the past mr dow said that mr rowland s long record of public service outweighed his ethical lapses while he was governor and that some of his crimes were the result of poor management skills , not malice the conflicting claims , included in court memos each side filed on thursday , came the day before mr rowland was to be sentenced for a felony conspiracy and tax fraud charge to which he pleaded guilty in december mr rowland , a republican who was elected to three terms as governor , resigned on july 1 amid a criminal investigation and an impeachment inquiry six months later he pleaded guilty to the conspiracy charge , for accepting 107 , 000 in vacations to vermont and florida , flights to las vegas and improvements to his litchfield vacation cottage from people seeking contracts or other assistance from the state mr rowland also admitted that he did not pay taxes on the gifts mr rowland , who dominated state politics for a decade , has largely dropped out of public view , though since his resignation he has earned as much as 15 , 000 a month from contracts with a building contractor and a nonprofit educational software company , according to prosecutors at one point , they said , he met with state officials to resolve a dispute with the contractor , the klewin building company of norwich , though it was unclear whether he had violated rules against lobbying after leaving office now the question is whether judge peter c dorsey of united states district court in new haven who is regarded as independentminded , will follow the 15 to 21month prison sentence federal guidelines recommend for the crimes to which mr rowland pleaded guilty jail time is appropriate , said gov m jodi rell , a republican who succeeded mr rowland i hope that after tomorrow that this sad chapter in our state s history is finally put to rest friends of mr rowland s said he was resigned i think he is prepared for the worst and hoping for the best , said brad davis , the host of a radio talk program and one of the former governor s longtime friends i think he wants to get this over with and i think he s looking beyond this has been a very trying experience this last year supporters and opponents of mr rowland have written more than 200 letters to judge dorsey slightly more than half the letters have urged severity rather than leniency , said maria rodrigues mcbride , the chief probation officer for the federal court system in connecticut mr dow , who had asked supporters to write letters , declined to comment on thursday about the sentencing he also would not discuss his work experience with judge dorsey mr dow was an assistant prosecutor while judge dorsey was united states attorney for the district of connecticut in the mid1970 s judge dorsey s signature case was the successful prosecution of a highprofile arson at a shelton factory in 1975 mr dow was his assistant on the case , which involved sponge rubber products co the united states supreme court ruled in january that federal sentencing guidelines were advisory , not mandatory several lawyers described judge dorsey , who was appointed to the bench in 1983 , as a thoughtful , sometimes unpredictable jurist who could be persuaded to lighten a sentence if a defendant showed genuine remorse greed , hubris or arrogance do n't sit well with judge dorsey , said harold j pickerstein , a southport lawyer and former united states attorney who has known the judge for 35 years but he s also not looking to lock people up so that they can be simply warehoused prosecutors said the prison sentence recommended in the plea agreement , 15 to 21 months , should be increased to 30 to 37 months because mr rowland continued his deceitful conduct since leaving office they said mr rowland did not disclose the retirement account or that a wealthy friend had promised 5 , 000 scholarships to two of his five children and stepchildren on a probation form in which defendants are asked to describe their anticipated assets , prosecutors said , mr rowland quaintly wrote 'none unfortunately ' mr dow , in his sentencing memo , said the existence of the retirement account had been reported in news articles and that mr rowland had previously disclosed it prosecutors argued that mr rowland had distorted his financial condition to the court and should not be given leniency for the financial hardships he claimed mr dow said prosecutors were making unjustified 11thhour attempts to stiffen the sentence the government will attempt to paint john rowland as a svengali who is responsible for everything from the stamp act to dutch elm disease and the chicago fire , mr dow wrote in a 24page memo he said mr rowland s management style of giving administrators great authority and leeway was a strength and , ultimately , a weakness he said it had allowed a former cochief of staff , peter n ellef , who was indicted last fall on corruption charges , to take advantage of his position to tilt the process of awarding state construction contracts to companies run by a friend , william a tomasso , who has also been indicted
washington , feb 27 the westinghouse electric corporation plans to present a bid to china on monday for building four huge nuclear reactors , backed by a pledge of nearly 5 billion in financial assistance from the united states government that it hopes will give the company an edge over competitors from france , germany and other nations but the package of loans and loan guarantees does not follow the typical pattern of the government s exportimport bank , and is raising objections from some critics approved on a preliminary basis by the bank on feb 18 , the package is almost three times larger than anything the bank has offered before and while it would stimulate employment in the united states , the price would amount to about 1 million a job the package also appears to benefit the british government , which owns westinghouse through bnfl , the company formerly known as british nuclear fuels if the risk were not falling on the exim bank , it would be falling on the british government , said peter a bradford , a member of the nuclear regulatory commission from 1977 to 1982 mr bradford said he opposed the subsidy to a foreign company , and what he said was support by the commission for westinghouse s sales efforts jobs really are n't what this is about what it s about is protecting the investors in the company making the bid , and here , there is only one investor representative dennis j kucinich , an ohio democrat who is a frequent critic of the bank , said , the bank is funded by us tax dollars they should be supporting us companies i'm not against us jobs , but should n't we be for us companies \? mr kucinich said that the deal could also eventually hurt the export of technology from this country because china has said that it wants to build many more plants and take over the manufacture of the components , many of which are now made in the united states a spokesman for the bank , phil cogan , said the aid package had nothing to do with shareholders the package , which would go to the bank for final approval if westinghouse won the bidding , is for the westinghouse electric company of monroeville in pennsylvania , he said ownership of the company makes absolutely no difference , he said bnfl bought westinghouse s nuclear unit from cbs , the broadcasting company , in 1998 bnfl s other businesses in the united states have met with mixed success the company contracted in the mid1990 s with the energy department to build a factory in washington state to solidify liquid nuclear wastes , but the two entities had a rancorous fallingout over costs and other factors this month , bnfl and the energy department settled a long dispute over bnfl s performance in cleaning up former nuclear weapons sites in tennessee and idaho the british government has intermittently discussed selling bnfl and its westinghouse subsidiary , and recently reorganized the company to make the company more attractive , the company recently separated some of its unprofitable ventures , including liabilities related to a subsidiary that recovered plutonium from spent nuclear fuel for reuse a spokesman for westinghouse , vaughn gilbert , said in a telephone interview from the company s headquarters in monroeville , near pittsburgh , that the proposal to build the chinese reactors represented about 5 , 000 jobs in the united states because components like the instrumentation and control systems would be manufactured here the reactor vessel and the steam generators , the largest parts , would come from other countries westinghouse would also supply the fuel , at least initially china has expressed interest in building dozens more reactors and sticking to a standard design , so winning this contract could mean many years of business , although fewer parts would be imported as time went on bidders are hoping for a decision from china by the end of the year the westinghouse design is said to incorporate passive safety features that require fewer active parts , like pumps , relying instead on features like cooling through natural heat circulation it is called the ap1000 , for advanced passive none have yet been sold spencer abraham , a former secretary of energy , told reporters after an appearance last week at the united states energy association that if china chose the westinghouse design , it might make it easier for electric utilities to build that model here mr cogan , the exim spokesman , said that the bank was backing only the portion of the contract that would involve work in the united states according to westinghouse , the american portion of the deal is half the reactors' value , suggesting that the four reactors would cost 10 billion , but the company would not disclose the amount of its bid asked how the level of support almost 5 billion for 5 , 000 jobs compared to that of other projects that the bank had nurtured , he insisted that the bank had no yardstick , and that dividing the amount of support by the number of jobs was not a good measure that s a crazy equation , mr cogan said the bank s announcements about its loan and loanguarantee packages often give few details , but in several recent cases where an amount and a number of jobs were specified , the dollarsperjob figures were far smaller for example , on feb 24 the bank announced it would guarantee a loan of 500 , 000 to a company in carson city , nev , that exports hoses , fittings , nuts and bolts , and that this would create up to 18 new jobs , which comes to less than 30 , 000 a job on jan 11 , it announced a guarantee that helped provide a 315 , 000 loan for a company in oakmont , pa , that makes equipment for testing the efficiency of filters the company had three employees but was faltering , the owner said in the announcement with the loan it got more business in china , and expanded its work force by two that works out to 63 , 000 a job mr cogan said that the cost to american taxpayers would depend on the success of the project if the loans are paid back on time , they could generate a profit for the bank , he said gary c hufbauer , a former deputy assistant secretary of the treasury for international trade and investment policy and now a senior fellow at the institute for international economics , a nonprofit group here , said that at one time the bank had a requirement that 65 percent of the work be in this country but , he said , the choice is , as this case illustrates , not between 100 percent us and 100 percent us it s 50 percent us and no percent at all and 50 percent is better than nothing but michael mariotte , the executive director of the nuclear information and resource service , an antinuclear group based here , said , you can think of other corporations that would be sounder risks he added , i'm sure there s cheaper ways to generate 5 , 000 jobs a lot of the money is not staying in the united states , and whatever profit is made on this deal is going to the uk
at the center literally of the battle over the plaza hotel is a line that not even the most discerning guest would notice the line , invisible except on zoning maps , runs through the plaza s ballroom one side of the ballroom and the rest of the plaza on that side of the line is in a residential zoning category that permits hotel rooms the other side and the rest of the hotel is zoned for commercial use the differences between residential and commercial zoning did not matter much when the plaza was booking the ballroom for benefits and weddings but now its owners are pushing to modify the zoning so they can turn the entire ballroom , along with two basement levels and some part of the first floor , into space for luxury stores opponents of the conversion , many of whom are preservationists , are troubled by the possible zoning changes , and not for the reasons preservationists usually express the plaza s owners say they are not planning any structural changes in the major public spaces none of their plans , as far as we know , would damage the architecture , said kent l barwick , the president of the municipal art society and a former chairman of the city s landmarks preservation commission , referring to the plaza s owners all they would do is take the heart out of the hotel by changing the way it s used he and other preservationists say that the commission is not required to consider the results of a change in use but they maintain that the commission should block a change that threatens the characteristics that made a landmark a landmark to change the uses that have animated these great spaces for nearly 100 years is a misuse of the commission s powers , mr barwick said a city is made great by its public spaces , including its public interiors it needs places for weddings and bar mitzvahs the plaza has been the center of that kind of activity , and is recognized as such around the world these traditions and uses should not be casually set aside the commission was to take up the zoning modification last week , but the plaza s owners withdrew their application at the last minute i withdrew it not because i'm changing my plans but because there s so much attention to the plaza and everybody s looking at small details , said miki naftali , the president and chief executive of the company that owns the plaza , elad properties i want to make sure my presentation is 100 percent complete with the right information in every visual i'm not ready 100 percent he said he would resubmit the application this month the zoning change is separate from a proposal before the commission to designate half a dozen rooms inside the plaza , including the palm court , the oak bar and the former edwardian room , as landmarks mr naftali has met with commission officials and said he favored the designations but the hotel workers' union has filed papers seeking to have the commission designate more of the interior than elad wants this month specifically , april 30 is also when mr naftali says the plaza will close , idling 900 workers elad paid 675 million for the 98yearold plaza last year it wants to turn the structure into a multipurpose building comprising multimilliondollar condominium apartments and a far smaller hotel , as well as the stores mr naftali said that negotiations with the hotel workers' union , which formed a save the plaza committee , had fizzled i do n't think we 'll have any negotiation , he said we are spending our time to prepare for april 15 that is the date of a city council hearing on a bill that would bar any hotel from converting more than 20 percent of its space to condominium or cooperative apartments mr naftali said that such a measure would be illegal and unconstitutional peter c ward , the president of the hotel workers' union , the new york hotel trades council , said he wanted to continue the talks with elad about the plaza i do n't intend to be sidetracked by other things , he said since late february , when mayor michael r bloomberg called mr ward and mr naftali to gracie mansion , the two sides have met , sometimes with city officials present , sometimes without both sides have said the topics ranged from a severance package for the plaza workers to mr naftali s ideas for building another hotel where former plaza employees could work an idea that union officials scorn at the plaza itself , the hotel mr naftali envisions once the remodeling is completed would be relatively small and mainly on the 58th street side of the building he has talked of 150 hotel rooms , as opposed to the 805 the plaza has now
toronto the blackout that left 50 million north americans without power two years ago tomorrow seems like something from the distant past , buried in our memories under a jumble of more recent events and in any case , ca n't we assume that our engineers and systems analysts studied the event , filed their reports , and tweaked the grid so it could never happen again \? certainly these experts learned many things and made many adjustments but none would argue that we 've eliminated the risk of another major blackout our grid s fragility results from a tangle of factors soaring electricity demand , aging power plants and sometimesrigid bureaucracies that will be addressed only with huge investments of money , time and political capital but perhaps the most important factor contributing to our continuing vulnerability is something that we rarely recognize and that s even harder to change a belief that greater connectivity and speed in all aspects of society are always good things yes , our highly connected world has given us great benefits , but it has sometimes made our technological , economic and social systems far less resilient that is , more susceptible to sudden and catastrophic breakdown in the economy , competition tends to tighten the connections between us , as companies naturally want to get the jump on competitors by doing things faster and cheaper they squeeze out waste and reduce slack in all parts of their production and distribution processes by , for instance , introducing justintime production systems to keep inventories to a minimum while greater connectivity allows companies larger profits , and gives society better ways to combine diverse ideas , skills and resources , it also harbors dangers most obviously , damage in one part of a system whether it s a voltage surge in the electrical grid , a new disease in a faroff country , or the sudden devaluation of a key currency can cascade farther and faster to other parts of the system less obviously , as a system becomes more complex , it can become opaque to its managers they might understand the bits and pieces they work on , but not what happens when all the bits and pieces interact together the 2003 blackout is again a good example deregulation of the grid in the 1990 s caused longdistance electricity sales to skyrocket , vastly increasing the connectivity and complexity of the whole electrical system at the time of the blackout , this system included 6 , 000 power plants run by 3 , 000 utilities overseen by 142 regional control rooms yet the system s technicians were often uncertain about its behavior because they were still trying to manage it using rules developed decades earlier when most power was generated reasonably close to its consumers in this environment , as one expert said , they needed the reflexes of a combat pilot managing an aircraft that has been badly damaged to cope with the grid s complexity and speed little surprise , then , that it eventually crashed how can we reduce the dangers \? the answers will vary from system to system , but some general principles are clear first , we need to encourage distributed and decentralized production of vital goods like energy and food the more power we produce with solar panels on our rooftops , the less vulnerable we 'll be to energy disruptions far away second , we need to remember that slack is n't always waste a manufacturing company with a large inventory may lose some money on warehousing , but it can keep running even if its suppliers are temporarily out of action finally , we need to be more selective about increasing the connectivity and speed of our critical systems because sometimes the costs outweigh the benefits these ideas fly in the face of the conventional wisdom that we should strive for evergreater economic efficiency and perhaps that s why politicians rarely acknowledge the importance of resilience the evidence that they do n't is as close as the nearest gas pump today s high gasoline prices include a stiff risk premium because there s virtually no slack in the world s tightly coupled oil economy for decades , the united states has become increasingly exposed to disruptions of its foreign oil supply now the country imports nearly twothirds of its petroleum , and 95 percent of the energy for its transport system the backbone of its economy comes from oil the energy bill signed by president bush this week does virtually nothing to address this appalling vulnerability clearly , it s going to take more than a blackout to make the point that in an efficient world , catastrophes can be very efficient , too oped contributor thomas homerdixon is director of the trudeau center for peace and conflict studies at the university of toronto
winter in connecticut can be bitter , but there is refuge in a thick coat and a warm hat and mittens , and serenity in a winter s walk the trees take center stage in a connecticut stroll long after

chairwoman of the college s botany department in the 1920 s the garden s shrubs and trees so overtook the garden space that by the 1960 s , most of the perennials had been pulled out that makes it a

four years after he won city hall as a novice politician , michael r bloomberg is far outpacing his recordbreaking spending in that race , and is well into a far more sophisticated second campaign for mayor one that uses a multimilliondollar votegetting machine that mimics many of the techniques used by the 2004 bush presidential campaign behind the reelection drive is the most comprehensive database of information about new yorkers their income levels , occupations , religious faith and interests collected by a mayoral campaign , devised to help mr bloomberg s team tailor messages to specific voters based on their profiles mr bloomberg , a billionaire businessman and a republican , has ordered his team to spare no expense in securing a second term , and since he is spending only his own money , he has a special ability to give those instructions and his team , led largely by seasoned democratic hands , is obeying his charge , spending in ways that have left his potential rivals agape while following a far more rigid game plan than in 2001 mr bloomberg s campaign has already spent more than 15 million , more than three times the amount spent by his four democratic rivals combined that is far ahead of his spending at this point in the 2001 race , when he smashed records for a new york city campaign by spending 74 million , more than three times the previous record , even after accounting for inflation i suppose i ca n't spend any more than i have , the mayor said , joking during a recent interview when asked how much he would spend but he added , i think it would be a great shame if you did n't have a second term to continue doing what you 're doing , because almost everything that we 've done would get rolled back the mayor added that this time the election would be a referendum on his stewardship of the city , and that his victory in 2001 , which enabled him to succeed rudolph w giuliani , was more a vote against his democratic opponent , mark green , than for him mr bloomberg won that race , with 50 percent of the vote to mr green s 47 percent , despite various missteps and misstatements the latest poll has shown mr bloomberg leading all his democratic opponents by comfortable margins , though the polls have been volatile his opponents are attacking him , saying he is too closely aligned with washington republicans and has the wrong priorities for the city mr bloomberg , his strategists say , learned through his gaffes in 2001 including his statement that year that sanitation workers had more dangerous jobs than police officers that a candidate can have as much to fear from himself as from his opponents , and that fact has driven him to be more disciplined aides were also chastened by the 2003 defeat of a citywide referendum for nonpartisan elections pushed by mr bloomberg , a disappointment that proved a campaign can spend huge sums and still fail if it neglects to build a coalition of support at the heart of the reelection drive is an aggressive television , radio and internet campaign that began last month with glowing ads promoting the mayor s record on crime , schools and jobs the ads are meant to deny the democrats any issues to use against the mayor as they approach their sept 13 primary , campaign aides said the campaign s approach also includes calling on a large number of volunteers trained to spread mr bloomberg s message to their neighbors this effort is akin to that of the 2004 campaign of president bush , with whose political advisers the bloomberg team has consulted the mayor s team , which is led by former aides to senator daniel patrick moynihan and includes former democratic presidential campaign strategists for bill clinton and john kerry , is also making a behindthescenes push to win over important democratic groups gay men and lesbians , unions , housing advocates or , at least , to placate them enough to take the passion out of their opposition mr bloomberg s campaign manager , kevin sheekey , is leading the reelection effort , and has been meeting with various leaders , especially union chiefs the campaign hopes that he will steal away at least some unions , especially in the construction trades , that traditionally get behind the democrats they are building a tank financially , politically , operationally , mr green said with the disparate resources plus incumbency , some see the democratic nominee like that brave chinese student standing in front of that tank at tiananmen square while the campaign is being methodically planned , one great uncertainty is who will emerge as the mayor s democratic opponent a perceived frontrunner , fernando ferrer , has stumbled in recent months , but aides to the bloomberg campaign say they believe mr ferrer will most likely win the primary politically , mr bloomberg is now free of what was the largest perceived drag on his standing in public opinion polls his plan for a west side stadium his overall popularity ratings are at their highest levels since his honeymoon nearly four years ago yet none of this negates the fact that voters in this overwhelmingly democratic city are often reluctant to back a republican polls also show that many voters still have doubts about whether mr bloomberg , a former democrat , cares about the problems of the average new yorker and whether his priorities extend beyond manhattan and one top campaign aide said the team s greatest challenge will come if democrats unite behind their nominee in that case , the winner of the democratic nomination would have the support of the traditional party organization , including major labor unions and political clubs , whose reach and resources surpass those of the city s tiny republican party mr bloomberg and his aides say his work will be cut out for him , especially against mr ferrer , the former bronx borough president , who is expected to cut significantly into the large share of the hispanic vote mr bloomberg received in 2001 if the candidate that runs against me is a latino , there will be a great deal of ethnic pride , mr bloomberg said in the interview , with reporters and editors of the new york times alluding to c virginia fields , the manhattan borough president and mr ferrer s closest primary opponent in recent polls , mr bloomberg said , if the candidate that runs against me is a black woman , there will be a great deal of ethnic pride but there are two other potential opponents , both of whom are white and have shown little traction in polls so far city council speaker gifford miller and united states representative anthony d weiner mr bloomberg has asked his campaign to look at every ethnic group with equal force in terms of spending and strategy i will reach out to every single group in this city , mr bloomberg said the mayor is taking a special interest in his campaign s huge collection of voter data , aides say he meets with his team at its midtown headquarters at least once a week as one senior strategist , william t cunningham , put it , he s a very competitive guy but aides acknowledge that he is making their jobs far easier this time , becoming a more disciplined campaigner who makes fewer gaffes than he did four years ago , with a much deeper understanding of the city he has spent more than 5 million on his voter database , which is being developed by his pollster , doug schoen , a former adviser to mr clinton that amount is roughly as much as mr bush s campaign spent for a national voter list last year mr cunningham said mr bloomberg s 2001 campaign used a voter list that was sophisticated by the standards of the time , but technology has improved it s the difference between going from xray machines to mri s , mr cunningham said mr cunningham would not share specifics about what personal information the list includes , but jerry skurnick , whose company , prime new york , collects voter data , said the possibilities were nearly endless they could conceivably identify somebody with a child in the public schools for specific mailings about bloomberg and education , mr skurnick said or , if they find somebody who s contributed to environmental groups , make phone calls and do mailings about what bloomberg has done on recycling mr bloomberg has yet to send out such mailings in any significant way , but he has begun a precise advertising blitz already , at a time when none of his potential opponents are in a position to do so , mr bloomberg is running ads on spanishlanguage stations like telemundo and univision , and ads on the web sites of newspapers like el diario one television ad , about a boy with cerebral palsy whose parents say he benefited greatly from mr bloomberg s personal help , is running on cable networks aimed at women , including lifetime , we and home and garden television a spot promoting his record on crime and featuring mr giuliani is running heavily on cable networks that particularly appeal to men , such as fox news channel , tnt and the yes network mr cunningham said the voter list would also be used as a tool for mr bloomberg s volunteers as they go door to door this summer the list will alert them to particular issues that neighbors may be interested in the point is , if they say they 're going to talk to 5 or 10 of their neighbors , we can get them what they need , mr cunningham said mr sheekey , the bloomberg campaign manager , said he hoped to put 50 , 000 volunteers to work so far , the campaign says , 15 , 000 have signed up the volunteer effort mirrors mr bush s campaign , which set out to build a huge network of supporters to counter the democrats' traditional organizational muscle in getting voters to the polls i think they recognize what they do n't have they do n't have a ground operation , they do n't have an infrastructure , an apparatus to support a field operation , said howard wolfson , a senior adviser to the state democratic party on the democratic side , he said , you 've got unions and political clubs reaching out to memberships , and they do n't have a membership but no matter how comfortable things may seem now , mr bloomberg s team says that november is a long way away we do n't know what s going to happen between now and election day , and we would be foolish not to be looking at every eventuality and trying to deal with it , mr cunningham said one thing we do know about new york city politics is something will happen that nobody can forecast sept 11 , the crown heights riots there is always some event that descends upon the city
mexico city , april 7 in a vote that casts doubt on the strength of mexico s fledgling democracy , this city s popular leftist mayor lost a critical battle in congress on thursday over a measure that is likely to force him off the ballot in presidential elections next year and could lead to his imprisonment hundreds of thousands of people were gathered in mexico city s central square throughout the day to protest the action , a rare proceeding known in mexico as a desafuero , in which mayor andr s manuel l pez obrador was stripped of his official immunity so he could stand trial in a minor land dispute in terms of political rights , the mexican constitution holds suspects guilty until proved innocent , so mr lopez will be banned from politics until the end of a trial legislators in the 500member chamber of deputies began debating the charges about 10 am in a scathing session that continued uninterrupted until the evening , when the vote was held of the 489 who attended the session , 360 favored lifting the immunity , 127 were opposed and there were 2 abstentions political analysts said that the proceedings were a critical test in this country s transition to a fullfledged democracy that began just five years ago when mexicans broke seven decades of singleparty rule with the peaceful election of vicente fox , the first president to come from an opposition party the protests , which had largely ended by late thursday , brought comparisons to the recent prodemocracy demonstrations in the ukraine that helped lift viktor a yuschenko to power but while mr lopez said support for him would grow , his adversaries seemed confident the protests would die out soon mr fox , who left mexico on thursday to attend the funeral for pope john paul ii , had often characterized the proceedings against mr lopez as proof that elected officials could no longer operate above the law but , addressing his supporters on thursday , mr l pez , 51 , called the action against him a farce , staged for political reasons , not legal ones , from the offices of the president indeed , cases like the one mayor lopez is facing rarely warrant prosecution , let alone imprisonment polls have consistently shown mr l pez as the leading candidate to succeed president fox the mayor said the president s conservative national action party and the institutional revolutionary party , or pri , which ran this country for seven consecutive decades , had forged an unlikely alliance to cripple his leftwing movement so that they could stay in power and maintain the status quo that claim appeared borne out in the vote all of the national action party s legislators voted in favor of lifting the immunity all but 12 members of the pri , which has a plurality in congress , voted in favor as well knocking him out of the race , mr l pez warned , would undermine the will of the people and move mexico back to an era when the political elite ruled like monarchs whichever of them wins , things remain the same , mr l pez said they will maintain a corrupt and privileged regime , and continue devouring the country the case against the mayor has polarized mexico , raising concerns about civil unrest here and worrying wall street mr l pez s spending on social programs and public works projects has made him popular among the poor and the struggling middle class together with his talk of reining in freetrade policies and renegotiating the national debt , that popularity has prompted some business leaders to compare him to venezuela s president , hugo ch vez his earthy , austere political style made ordinary mexicans feel he understood their problems but evidence of corruption among the mayor s aides his chief political operative was caught by secret cameras accepting bribes from a wealthy businessman and his refusal to voluntarily submit to prosecution in the land dispute made others wonder whether mr l pez was dishonest newspaper polls have shown that as many as 60 percent of mexicans reject the proceedings against mr l pez as a political conspiracy still , no matter what side they are on , mexican political leaders , intellectuals and business executives have said they considered this a pivotal moment in their history at stake , they said , was not whether or not mr l pez committed a minor crime , but the legitimacy of the upcoming presidential elections and of the multiparty democracy that emerged from the last i am not here for l pez obrador i am here for mexico , said elisabeth cazares , a housewife who attended the demonstration on thursday in the central square , called the z calo there is a small class of powerful people in mexico who live above us like they are in some kind of heaven on earth , and they think they know what is best and that the rest of us are incapable of making good choices but we deserve a chance to govern referring to the dictatorship of porfirio d az in the late 19th and early 20th centuries , she added , it is hard for me to accept that in these times , mexico is still run like it was in the porfiriato mr l pez , who has a history of leading violent protests , called on followers this time to mount a peaceful campaign of civil disobedience , and avoid harmful acts that could erode their public support he has said he wants to emulate the rev martin luther king jr and gandhi nothing of violence , he told the crowds on thursday no falling to provocation this movement has been and will be peaceful to do otherwise would be to act in the logic of our adversaries , and we cannot allow that the next step in the action , which is similar to an impeachment proceeding , is likely to be an order for mr lopez s arrest and his ouster from his position as mayor mr lopez has said he would remain in jail throughout the trial , rather than posting bail , as an act of civil disobedience it became clear this week that concern about unrest had spread beyond mexico foreign investors , who had helped double mexican stock market values since early 2003 , began to raise questions about whether the worsening political crisis could upset an otherwise stable mexican economy the stock market here had fallen more than 12 percent since a peak a month ago while the rest of the world mourned the death of pope john paul ii , this mostly roman catholic country seemed consumed by the legal proceedings against mr l pez his appearance before congress became a moment of riveting political drama the lead prosecutor against mr l pez , carlos vega memije , told legislators that for 11 months , mr l pez had disobeyed a court order against building a hospital access road echoing the fox party line , he said that the time had come to stop the mexican authorities from abusing their power to stand above the law what mexico do we want , the prosecutor asked , the mexico of laws , or the mexico of impunity mr l pez scoffed at the prosecutor s arguments then he asserted that his accusers were guilty of much bigger crimes of government corruption that had cost the country billions of dollars and untold numbers of lives , and that none had been prosecuted correction april 18 , 2005 , monday a frontpage article on april 8 about a political crisis caused by the possibility that mexico city s popular leftist mayor , andr s manuel l pez obrador , could be forced off the 2006 presidential ballot referred imprecisely to protests he has led in the past while some , including a 1996 blockade of oil wells in the coastal state of tabasco , turned violent after police officers and soldiers were ordered to remove demonstrators , the protests started out peacefully
the untold story of the shift of monday night football to espn from abc next season is how much espn wanted to hire cbs s jim nantz until now , the tale stayed quiet because as soon as abc lost the rights to monday night football in midapril , speculation focused on where john madden and al michaels would go would they go as a pair to espn or to nbc universal sports when it starts sunday night football next year \? in june , madden signed with nbc almost six weeks later , michaels rejected nbc s offer , choosing to follow monday night to espn for 41 million a year \( as well as 2 million annually to call pro basketball for abc \) that nantz was coveted by espn was , in a way , cbs s fault after the 2003 season , sean mcmanus , the president of cbs sports , moved nantz to the game booth , calling the no 1 games with phil simms , from the studio as the host of the nfl today greg gumbel replaced nantz in the studio nantz excelled in the oneseason showcase despite not having called football for years , he showed he was still in the top echelon of playbyplay announcers , adding to his reputation in calling golf and college basketball espn thus had strong options in nantz and michaels as it considered whether to retain mike patrick as the network s playbyplay announcer next year , when its nfl package moves to monday night from sunday the nantz flirtation started soon after espn became the new home of monday night football and continued through the first two weeks of may i knew jim and espn were talking , but i always felt that deep in my soul , he was a cbs guy , the face and voice of cbs sports , les moonves , the chairman of cbs , said yesterday at baltusrol golf club in springfield , nj , where cbs and tnt are televising the pga championship moonves was not surprised at outside interest in nantz , who had one year left on his cbs contract at the time i fully expected espn to talk to him and for nbc to talk to him , he said in the meantime , michaels was considering espn s offer and one from nbc for 29 million a year he had as strong an ally as possible to persuade him to go to espn robert iger , the president of the walt disney company , the parent company of espn and abc sports nantz might not have had iger on his side , but he would have done more events at espn than michaels yet none would equal what he would call at cbs if he resigned with the only network he has worked at figures provided by television executives familiar with the suggested financial terms , who chose not to speak publicly because a formal contract was never tendered to nantz , indicated that espn was willing to pay 35 million to 45 million annually , pending iger s approval two of the main players in the negotiations , mark shapiro , espn s executive vice of programming and production , and barry frank , nantz s agent , declined to comment moonves and mcmanus were hoping that loyalty , and a bump in his current salary to about 35 million a year , would keep nantz around as the lead voice of the masters , the ncaa final four and the national football league if he called monday night for espn , he would not call super bowls , as he will continue to do at cbs if he called golf or college basketball at espn , he would not encounter the drama of augusta national or of a national championship game beside billy packer i ca n't contemplate a cbs sports without jim nantz as our primary announcer , mcmanus said by telephone yesterday , so no matter what the interest was from another party , i would have made sure he stayed and he did but first , nantz met with moonves , who recalled , he came to me mano a mano , and wanted to hear how important he was to us and on may 19 , two months before michaels s deal with espn was announced , nantz signed a sevenyear extension to stay at cbs by making his deal at that time , he was left out of the speculation about who would take the playbyplay job at nbc or replace patrick at espn observing him at baltusrol , watching tnt s coverage in a cbs trailer with gary mccord , peter kostis and bill macatee , is to watch someone happy in his surroundings and pleased with his decision i have really strong relationships with the people i work for and with , nantz said , sitting on a golf cart at the cbs compound among them are mcmanus , who was once one of his agents at img , and is the son of abc s jim mckay , whom he idolizes and , with arguably the strongest schedule of events that anyone could ask for , it s almost impossible to tear me away
the short turnaround week for the nfl teams involved in the annual thanksgiving day games is of little concern to those fans eager for entertainment laced with aromas from a holiday kitchen but the strain this year is more profound than usual for bill parcells , the dallas cowboys' coach though he twice guided the giants through the postseason gantlet to win the super bowl , the cowboys' game thursday against the denver broncos ends what was perhaps the most trying twoweek stretch in parcells s coaching career i'm not trying to make this more than it is , parcells said , but this is not easy to do his challenge was preparing his team for three opponents in 11 days and to do so while mourning the death of his younger brother don , 62 , who was buried nov 14 , a few hours before the cowboys' 2120 victory in philadelphia don parcells , two years younger than bill parcells and a vietnam veteran and retired banker , died of brain cancer bill parcells flew to philadelphia with his team , but few players knew beforehand that he also made a 90minute drive to attend the funeral service in short hills , nj , returning shortly before kickoff if he wanted to fill us in , he would 've done that , wide receiver terry glenn said but he wanted to keep that to himself and handle it with no distractions you 've got to respect a guy like that the cowboys scored two touchdowns in a 21second span against the eagles with just over three minutes left to win their performance against detroit last sunday was more tepid , but the lions committed 17 penalties to help the cowboys win at home , 207 now , just four days later , they face the broncos , whose 82 record trails only indianapolis \( 100 \) in the american football conference parcells admitted there had been little time for grief , given the cowboys' schedule parcells said he thought the busy schedule has , in some ways , yes , been a help but , mentally , i was geared into this '11 days' thing for quite a while , he said it s not easy parcells has long operated with a gruff exterior that conceals soft spots for his favorite players that he would mask his pain for the sake of the team surprised none of the players who know him best one thing about bill , he s a professional , said glenn , who previously played for parcells at new england he s not going to bring any personal things inside this locker room he either keeps it to himself or handles it with his family that s how most professionals do things , so i'm not surprised that he handled it the way he wanted to cowboys defensive tackle la'roi glover said that when parcells reveals emotional strain , he only does so inadvertently it s like anyone , glover said if you have a death in the family or the kids are sick or whatever , you 're going to be a little down , you 're not going to seem like your old self once we all found out what it was , we kind of understood and said , 'hey , let s just focus in and do our jobs and try to take some of the pressure off' wide receiver keyshawn johnson , who played three seasons for parcells with the jets from 1997 to 1999 , is one of the few players parcells told about his brother s illness people that know him and have got a feel for him can understand what he could possibly be going through , johnson said , but i do n't think any one particular player who played for him in the past is really trying to find anything out we 're just trying to go along with the way he approaches things that means concentrating exclusively on the next game parcells took less than eight hours off after the victory over detroit , returning to his office monday at 2 50 am to begin preparing for the broncos , whom he called the best team we 've faced all year the result has been the cowboys' first threegame winning streak since 2003 , when parcells first arrived that team finished 106 and earned the franchise s first playoff appearance in four seasons the cowboys slipped to 610 last year , but they have already exceeded that number of victories this season after a 22 start , the cowboys have won five of their last six games including three in a row and , now at 73 , they share the lead in the national football conference east with the giants johnson said nothing would help parcells more than to extend the winning streak , though the effects might not be readily apparent when you win , it obviously makes things a lot better , johnson said with a smile he added that parcells s demeanor never really changes he s sour when you win , and he s sour when you lose , johnson said photos bill parcells has been mourning his brother don , 62 , whose funeral was nov 14 \( photo by jeff mitchell reuters \) \( pg d1 \) for bill parcells , the dallas cowboys' game today against the denver broncos ends what was perhaps the most trying twoweek stretch in his coaching career \( photo by matt slocum associated press \) \( pg d4 \)
a generation has grown up loving punk , listening to all those tuneful , energetic , cleanscrubbed bands you can see these bands on fuse and mtv during the school year , and you can catch them on the warped tour during the summer for that generation , the gainesville , fla , punk band against me ! may be something of a revelation , what with its hoarse choruses and antiwar verses and firstpumping fans who knew that punk rock could sound so , y' know , punk \? against me ! arrived at webster hall on friday night ready to entertain an audience that started slamdancing even before hearing the few seconds of guitar feedback that began the set then the drummer , warren oakes , struck up a sturdy beat and tom gabel , the band s singer and lyricist , got right to the point regime change under a bush doctrine democratic installations constant war for constant soldiers what are we gonna do now \? those are the first lines of from her lips to god s ears \( the energizer \) , from the band s rousing album searching for a former clarity \( fat wreck chords \) not all of the songs on the album have the same explicit focus on foreign policy in fact , none of them do but most of them sound just as agitated , whether the subject is deceitful lovers or deceitful lead singers \( and , yes , he s talking about that fellow in the gainesville punk band \) mr gabel has a winsome way of undermining his own outrage in his songs , anger is always melting into anguish and then evaporating , until all that s left is a freefloating wildeyed confusion mtv2 has been playing the video for do n't lose touch , which has a buoyant bass line and plenty of ambivalence as the band played it on friday night , mr gabel sang , is there something wrong with these songs \? maybe there s something wrong with the audience needless to say , that same audience was singing along against me ! owes plenty to the clash , and to the fast and tough sound of 1980 s hard core but on friday night , you could also hear more unusual influences some of the songs evoked the boozy , midtempo punk subgenre known as oi , and others bore traces of the band s former self against me ! used to be a folkpunk act , with little more than an acoustic guitar to accompany mr gabel s roar it would be a mistake to think of against me ! as a corrective to those caffeinated love songs that define punk these days \( for starters , poppunk is n't really in need of correction \) and in any case , this band is n't well suited , musically or temperamentally , for punkrock purism part of the thrill of the songs is the way they simultaneously reach for certainty and shrink from it near the end , all the musicians left except for mr gabel , who strummed his guitar and sang , all is quiet , except for this song so maybe while i'm not together i can feel like i'm not alone this was a modest moment , but a memorable one and everyone knew that in a few minutes , his bandmates would be back and the band would be galloping again
nearly two years ago , attorney general john ashcroft personally announced to congress that federal prosecutors had filed terrorismfinancing charges against a yemeni sheik and his aide law enforcement officials indicated that the sheik , mohammed ali hassan almoayad , had used a brooklyn mosque to help funnel millions of dollars to al qaeda and had boasted that he had personally delivered 20 million to osama bin laden but as a federal judge in brooklyn began questioning jurors yesterday for the scheduled start of testimony next week , pretrial filings suggest the prosecutors are pursuing a somewhat different , and even pareddown , case the allegations about al qaeda and ties to mr bin laden have faded in importance to the case , the filings from lawyers on both sides have indicated it now appears that the prosecutors will not even mention the supposed 20 million delivery to mr bin laden the trial is expected to focus far more than had been expected on the sheik s ties to hamas , a group that has been labeled a terrorist organization by the united states government , but that also has charitable operations the connection to hamas was mentioned when the charges were filed , but it drew far less attention though it seems clear that the prosecutors still believe the sheik had al qaeda connections , some practical problems appear to be at play , stemming from the nettlesome art of fitting a complex case that was announced in a burst of publicity to the sober realities of the courtroom , and limiting the amount of proof they can introduce on the issue of al qaeda hampering the prosecutors especially is the fact that their main informer , mohamed alanssi , a yemeni man with a troubled history , set himself on fire outside the white house in november that strange act drew attention to a history that included legal troubles and bad debts it meant that he would be a troublesome witness , and the prosecutors have suggested that they may not call him it was mr alanssi who told federal agents about some of the allegations about the sheik s supposed ties to al qaeda , including the claim about the delivery of 20 million , and those claims may not be admissible if he does not testify the apparent change in emphasis has opened a door for the defense to argue that the case is an effort by prosecutors to make it appear that they have an al qaeda operative in the dock in brooklyn who was a direct threat to the united states william h goodman , one of the sheik s lawyers , said in an interview this week that a case focusing on hamas would not have drawn the worldwide attention the charges drew in march 2003 this is a bad case that should be dropped , mr goodman said they know it should be dropped because they started it because of his alleged connections to bin laden and they now know he has none mr goodman said the sheik s ties to hamas focused on charitable work , a contention the prosecutors are expected to dispute robert nardoza , a spokesman for the united states attorney s office in brooklyn , declined to respond in detail to the defense lawyers' claims but he said , we are confident that the necessity for prosecuting this case will be firmly established when the evidence is presented to the jury the prosecutors have never said they are giving up their assertions that sheik moayad had close ties to mr bin laden , and they say they will introduce evidence that the sheik sponsored al qaeda fighters they will lean heavily on secretly recorded conversations in which they say the sheik described himself as mr bin laden s sheik and repeatedly promised two government informers that any money they gave him would be used for jihad the prosecutors quoted the sheik as saying he supported all such terrorist organizations , hamas , al qaeda , prisoners , mujahedeen and such but , the defense often notes , transcripts of surreptitiously recorded conversations in germany often seem to undercut the justice department s initial claims about the sheik s ties to mr bin laden those claims seemed to leave open the possibility that the sheik s fundraising might have contributed to the sept 11 attacks but a more ambiguous account has emerged in the legal filings according to a government transcript , the sheik described some of his contacts with mr bin laden as occurring in the 1980 s , long before the crises of the sept 11 attacks , at a time when mr bin laden was fighting in afghanistan with support from the united states prosecutors went on to say in a brief that sheik moayad added that , after the afghanistan jihad was over , they started feuding among themselves and sheik moayad distanced himself from them , evidently referring to mr bin laden and his followers but when they focus on hamas , the transcripts suggest , the prosecutors' strongest evidence may come from the recorded words of sheik moayad himself i'm in touch with and have the knowledge of every aspect of hamas s activities , the prosecutors quoted the sheik as saying in the secretly taped conversations in germany , in january 2003 aside from the prosecutors' evident shift in emphasis , there have been other ways in which the outlines of the case have seemingly changed the focus on a brooklyn muslim center , al farooq mosque on atlantic avenue , was intense in the first days of the case but the mosque has barely been mentioned during pretrial skirmishes and it is not clear how central the allegations about fundraising there may be jonathan marks , the lawyer for mohammed mohsen yahya zayed , the sheik s assistant , who is to be tried with him , said in an interview that the prosecutors were stuck with a case that promised more than it could deliver if convicted of the charges of providing material support to terrorist organizations , the sheik , 56 , could be sentenced to more than 60 years in prison mr zayed , 31 , who is to be tried with the sheik , could face more than 30 years although the prosecution s emphasis may be changing , the charges and potential penalties have not changed both men were extradited to brooklyn from germany , where they were arrested in 2003 it is very important for the bush administration to show that they are winning the war on terrorism , mr marks said attorney general ashcroft billed this case as a case against a major financier of al qaeda there is no evidence of that at all defense lawyers said that of some 270 potential jurors who filled out questionnaires , onethird , 90 people , said they could not be impartial because of the type of case it is
annapolis , md , may 27 president bush told nearly 1 , 000 graduates of the united states naval academy on friday that the pentagon s plan to close dozens of bases across the country was part of an effort to transform america s military and that the process , though hard on many local communities , would be fair the military services have each done a review of their requirements , and they have concluded that we have more bases than we need , mr bush said in his first public remarks on the closings since the pentagon announced its recommendations on may 13 supporting these facilities wastes billions of taxpayer dollars , money that can be better spent on giving you the tools to fight terrorists and confront 21stcentury threats on a hot , sunny morning in navymarine corps memorial stadium , near the edge of the chesapeake bay , mr bush also told the class , assembled in dress whites and dress blues , that much had changed since he last addressed annapolis graduates at that commencement , in may 2001 , he told the new officers that they were inheriting a safer and more peaceful world none of us imagined , he said friday , that a few months later we would suffer a devastating surprise attack on our homeland or that our nation would be plunged into a global war unlike any we had known before today we face brutal and determined enemies men who celebrate murder , incite suicide and thirst for absolute power mr bush , who appears strikingly younger and less gray in pictures taken at the 2001 commencement , used this year s 30minute address to review his administration s response to the attacks of sept 11 , 2001 he cited the wars in afghanistan and iraq and new technology like the socalled thermobaric version of the hellfire missile , which , he noted , can reach around corners and strike enemies hidden in caves in the coming years , he said , there are going to be some awfully surprised terrorists when the thermobaric hellfire comes knocking the president did not directly mention the 10 annapolis graduates who have died in military campaigns since he last addressed the academy , although he did speak generally of american casualties some of our men and women in uniform have given their lives in this cause , and others have returned home with terrible injuries , he said america honors their sacrifice , and we will uphold the cause they served of the base closings , which would affect all 50 states , mr bush said he knew firsthand about the impact on local communities i was governor of texas during the last round of base closures , when facilities were shut down in places like lubbock and laredo and austin , he said we 'll do everything possible to help affected communities make the transition as smoothly as possible , by providing economic development aid , job training and assistance with redevelopment plans for affected bases the process will result in a military that is more efficient and better prepared , mr bush told the graduates , so you can better protect the american people against the dangers of this new century but the ninemember independent commission reviewing the pentagon proposal has voiced skepticism about it , saying it could hurt recruiting and might not produce the promised saving , which the administration puts at 48 billion over the next 20 years the commission , which can add to or subtract from the list of facilities to be closed , will spend the next three months in hearings and visits to those facilities , and must submit its findings to mr bush by sept 8 the president and congress will then have until nov 7 to accept or reject those findings , but cannot modify them the plan came under additional fire on friday from lawmakers of the states that would be hit hardest by it they , and the commission s chairman , anthony j principi , demanded that the defense department release documents in support of its recommendations , and by the end of the day pentagon officials had promised to release most of the data next tuesday the pentagon recommendations would close , consolidate or shrink more than 800 military facilities from maine to hawaii , including 33 big bases they would shut the navy s submarine base in groton , conn , a move that would cost nearly 8 , 500 military and civilian jobs , the largest single loss in the proposal after mr bush concluded his remarks friday , he spent two hours standing beneath an awning on the stadium field , shaking the hands of all the graduates as they crossed a stage to receive their diplomas nearly three hours after the ceremony began , it ended with the traditional shout of hip , hip , hooray from the graduates , who tossed their hats into the air as new navy ensigns and marine second lieutenants a short time later , mr bush lifted off in his helicopter , marine one , for a memorial day weekend in the catoctin mountains at camp david

would da bad guy help a family that lost nearly everything in a fire or spend his day off in louisiana with victims of hurricane katrina \? can compassion ever be overrated \? abraham did not know joyce lyde , who lives in his hometown , timmonsville , sc but in november 2002 , he helped her when a fire caused by an electric heater took the lives of four of her five children and destroyed her mobile home abraham paid for the funerals and bought her a new mobile home reached by telephone in south carolina , lyde said of the jet she has never met , he is a very nice person that really helped me in a time of need abraham said i felt like i had to do something because , you know , who better than me \?

jerusalem , june 26 israel s cabinet approved a plan on sunday for a new community along israel s mediterranean coast in an effort to accommodate jewish settlers who will be removed from the gaza strip when israel withdraws from the area this summer the cabinet s move was intended to persuade the settlers , who remain staunchly opposed to the evacuation , to cooperate the government proposal will , in effect , allow the gaza settlers to reestablish their communities up the coastline , a few miles to the north of the gaza strip in southern gaza , israeli security forces scuffled with about 100 jewish settlers and supporters on sunday as the army demolished 11 derelict beach cottages the supporters of the settlers planned to occupy the cottages as they helped settlers demonstrate against the planned evacuation the confrontation was seen as a precursor to larger showdowns that could take place when the security forces move in to uproot nearly 9 , 000 settlers in midaugust the crumbling cottages dated to the era of egypt s control of gaza , before the 1967 war , and had long since been abandoned the conflict on sunday came as the military , to preempt the plans to reoccupy the cottages , called in bulldozers and flattened the concrete structures in theory , all the gaza settlers could move to the new development approved by the cabinet , to be called nitzanim , and none would have to move much more than 30 miles from their present homes , most of which are also near the beach however , the plan faced criticism on several fronts israeli environmentalists and beach lovers oppose largescale building along one of the last open stretches of israel s coast some politicians object to offering the settlers the land for only a fraction of the cost of comparable real estate nearby the main settlers' organization , the yesha council , was also dismissive even if this addresses a problem for some of the gaza residents who are being made homeless , it does not address the larger issue of how big this rollback might eventually become , said yisrael medad , a spokesman for yesha if israel continues to retreat and weaken its position , things will only get worse a vast majority of the 1 , 600 settler families in gaza still oppose the pullout but with the evacuation date less than two months away , increasing numbers are contacting the government agency working to relocate them , israeli officials say i think the proposal , despite all the problems surrounding it , is all in all a reasonable decision , isaac herzog , the housing minister , told israel radio the government plan calls for building nitzanim just to the north of the southern coastal town of ashkelon the boundaries were not announced , but the area includes an unspoiled beach and rolling sand dunes that make up a nature reserve it was not clear how much of the reserve might be taken over for the development shalom simhon , the environment minister , was one of only two cabinet members to vote against the plan he has spoken out against developing the area , and said sunday that the land should not be sold at cutrate prices this offer is in addition to the compensation the settlers will receive for the evacuation , which is expected to average about 200 , 000 to 300 , 000 per family the reduced land prices are something that is not given to any other citizen in the state of israel and there is no reason to give this to someone who is already benefiting from the evacuation compensation law , mr simhon told israel radio however , prime minister ariel sharon , who waged a fierce campaign to win approval for the gaza withdrawal , says he wants to make the transition as smooth as possible for the settlers during the clash in southern gaza , the israeli protesters eventually broke through a cordon of israeli security force members and climbed atop armored bulldozers in an attempt to halt the demolition the security forces removed the protesters from the bulldozers and dragged them across the beach the soldiers put aside their rifles before the scuffling began , though 10 protesters and 10 members of the security forces suffered minor injuries , according to the military during the protest , one soldier shouted , jews do n't expel jews ! the slogan adopted by the settlers and other opponents of the gaza withdrawal the soldier was then removed by his fellow soldiers and will face a disciplinary hearing , the military said the military says it is concerned that some soldiers may refuse to take part in the evacuation , adding that they are dealing with the issue before the withdrawal begins another potential complication is a large influx of israeli supporters of the settlers one group has moved into a beachfront hotel that was largely abandoned in recent years in another development on sunday , 1 , 000 mourners took part in a funeral for a 17yearold israeli , avihai levy , who was shot dead friday by palestinian gunmen in the west bank , near hebron the mourners , many dressed in orange , the color chosen by the opponents of the gaza withdrawal , traveled past mr sharon s office in jerusalem on the way to the burial on the mount of olives a second youth who was shot in the attack at a hitchhiking post , 16yearold aviad mantzur , died of his wounds on sunday
on his cellphone as he was landing in dallas for the winter meetings yesterday , jeffrey loria was asked about his disappearing team you mean our young team that we 're going to build into another championship team \? loria , the owner of the florida marlins , said in response loria sounded upbeat i expect that the club will be a very interesting baseball team , he said there will be a lot of young , very exciting , interesting talent but how could anyone who in less than two weeks has lost threequarters of his infield , his catcher , his no 2 starting pitcher and his setup reliever be upbeat \? and those losses do n't include the center fielder , who like the others , will surely be traded , and three free agents , including the no 3 starting pitcher and the shortstop , who will not be resigned those 10 players , twofifths of the marlins' roster , earned 40 million , or twothirds , of last season s 60 million payroll the six players they have traded will make 41 million next season , which will be more than the marlins' anticipated 30 million payroll we 're getting our payroll in line with our revenues , loria said but revenues will be even smaller next year than this year , when the marlins had the lowest average attendance in the national league and the third lowest in the major leagues that s what we budgeted for , loria said we 're budgeting for anticipated revenue i'm done losing money until there s a commitment from others we made a major commitment , the fourth largest in baseball history loria referred to the amount of money , more than 200 million , he was willing to put into the construction of a baseballonly park in miami for a couple of years , the florida legislature balked at giving 60 million to the project more recently , local government scuttled it without a new park in sight , loria , pushed by the team president david samson , decided the marlins could n't sustain a payroll at franchiserecord levels it s as painful as it is disappointing , but it s necessary to make this market correction , loria said the time comes when you have to say enough is enough market correction is a nice euphemism h wayne huizenga and dave dombrowski did n't think of it eight years ago when they executed the marlinsdismantling trick the first time around the marlins won the 1997 world series and never had a chance to repeat seemingly minutes after craig counsell stepped on home plate with the serieswinning run , huizenga ordered dombrowski , the general manager , to shed all of the highpriced players it brings back memories , dombrowski , now president of the detroit tigers , said yesterday of the marlins' latest demolition nobody enjoyed the experience of what we had to do before the end of that year , dombrowski traded moises alou , robb nen , devon white , jeff conine , kevin brown and dennis cook he traded al leiter the following february and gary sheffield , bobby bonilla , charles johnson and jim eisenreich in may the marlins received mike piazza and todd zeile for the sheffield group , and dombrowski traded piazza a week later and zeile two and a half months later people have asked me which is worse , conine said yesterday from his home in south florida he rejoined the marlins in 2003 , in time to get a second world series ring that october , and he remained a marlin through the 2005 season i 'd say '97 , because we did n't have a chance to defend our title , conine said our biggest disappointment was we could n't stay together and try to do it again this time around , mr loria added pieces and we made strides in trying to reach the postseason the past two years that s all you can ask now conine has watched the marlins trade carlos delgado and paul lo duca to the mets mike lowell , josh beckett and guillermo mota to boston and luis castillo to minnesota it s quite a barrage , said conine , a free agent my head is spinning though he waited longer than huizenga in demolishing the marlins , and is far more of a baseball man , loria is conducting a fire sale for the same reason huizenga did the inability to get a park that would attract more fans and revenue huizenga , though , acted more impetuously if they 're going to continue to operate for the long term in that area , dombrowski said of the marlins , they 're going to have to come up with a baseballonly facility if they had the right facility , it s a tremendous market for baseball commissioner bud selig has told loria that he can explore other potential homes where could the marlins go \? portland , ore , would welcome the marlins so would las vegas mexico city \? san juan , puerto rico \? not very likely no other cities have exhibited an interest by expressing a willingness to build a park loria and his aides will soon begin their exploration meanwhile , they will have a young team that could fall behind florida s other team , the tampa bay devil rays , who are getting a second chance under a new owner , stuart sternberg , who , like loria , is a new yorker in their four trades , the marlins have acquired six pitchers \( of the players who have been named \) , none of whom is expected to be ready for the majors at the start of next season they also obtained two potential everyday players , first baseman mike jacobs and shortstop hanley ramirez conine does n't figure to join them he has lived in south florida for 11 years , he noted , but you always want to be competitive he will be looking to play somewhere else in 2006 and at the age of 39 , he probably wo n't be around for world series championship iii for the marlins , whenever and wherever that may be
beijing , march 20 the congregation at gangwashi protestant church broke into applause for secretary of state condoleezza rice on sunday evening as she rose to leave after the palm sunday service gangwashi is one of a handful of china s stateapproved churches , allowed to operate in this officially atheistic country only if all elements including hymns and scripture are cleared by the government ms rice , the daughter of a presbyterian minister , said she did not want to miss palm sunday while traveling but she clearly also wanted to make a statement in china services would have been easier to attend in one of the many protestant churches in seoul , south korea , where she spent the morning and afternoon twentyfour hours earlier , she made a major statement to north korea , visiting the military command bunker outside seoul where commanders would direct any war involving the north north korea s nuclear weapons program has been her primary focus on her tour of japan , south korea and china , and a senior state department official who briefed reporters traveling with ms rice said she had begun raising the question of what should be done if , as expected , the north koreans refused to return to the sixnation disarmament talks they left last june but ms rice has also been talking about the need for china to become more open and democratic by offering , among other new liberties , freedom of religion when china s leaders look around them in asia , they will see that freedom works , she said saturday in tokyo they will see that freedom of religion and respect for human rights are part of the foundation of decent and successful societies she arrived at the church on sunday evening , immediately after meeting with president hu jintao at the great hall of the people , where the primary subject was , once again , north korea the state department official said she would raise the topics of democratic change and freedom of religion with chinese leaders on monday but on sunday evening , she settled into the first row of the packed church , smiling , and put on headphones to hear a translation of the minister s remarks one of his governmentapproved statements was , the lord came not to overthrow the government as the congregation of some 500 sang the hymn constantly abiding in chinese , accompanied by a choir of 22 in crimson and white robes , she sang along in english , including the opening line , there s a peace in my heart that the world never gave earlier in the day , she met with prime minister wen jaibao , telling him she wanted to address the many problems as well as the many opportunities that are affecting us in the asiapacific region , and also around the world , according to a transcript of the meeting the senior state department official said she had told mr wen and mr hu that she hoped china would step up its efforts to persuade north korea to return to the nuclear disarmament talks the official said that she had even suggested that they use the formulation she employs on north korea that , by getting rid of its nuclear weapons program , it can gain the respect it wants and the assistance it needs the official said mr hu responded that china wanted a denuclearized korean peninsula and will continue to work to bring north korea back to the talks china has suggested that it is unconvinced by american intelligence indicating that north korea has as many as nine plutoniumbased nuclear bombs and is aggressively pursuing a second method of producing uraniumbased nuclear fuel the united states is in a delicate diplomatic situation with china , wanting it to bring its economic and political leverage to bear on north korea but worried by beijing s military buildup in south korea , ms rice had criticized the european union for its plan to drop its arms embargo against china the senior state department official said , we do n't want to see a situation where american forces face european technologies in an asian conflict but the official added that none of the tough language about china that ms rice had been offering in other asian capitals or her visit to the church seemed to have clouded the meetings with china s leaders he said the planned visit was not discussed during her meetings with the president and the prime minister correction march 22 , 2005 , tuesday an article yesterday about the visit to china by secretary of state condoleezza rice misspelled the given name of the chinese prime minister , who talked with her about the stalled negotiations over north korean nuclear disarmament and other issues he is wen jiabao , not wen jaibao correction march 25 , 2005 , friday an article on monday about secretary of state condoleezza rice s visit to the gangwashi protestant church in beijing for palm sunday services misstated the estimate of stateapproved christian churches in china there are hundreds , not a handful \( beijing itself has eight \)
three years ago , president bush created the millennium challenge account to give more money to poor countries that are committed to policies promoting development mr bush said his government would donate billions in incremental stages until the program got to a high of 5 billion a year starting in 2006 while 5 billion is just 004 percent of america s national income , president bush touted the proposal as proof that he cares about poverty in africa and elsewhere i carry this commitment in my soul , the president said for the third straight year , mr bush has committed a lot less than he promised michael phillips of the wall street journal reports that the white house has quietly informed the managers of the millennium challenge account to expect about 3 billion in the next budget this follows a sad pattern mr bush said he would ask congress for 17 billion in 2004 he asked for 13 billion and got 1 billion he said he would ask for 33 billion in 2005 he asked for 25 billion and got 15 billion so if past is prologue , the republican congress will cut the diluted 2006 pledge even further none of that appears to bother the bush administration , which continues to send highranking officials into the world to promote the anemic millennium challenge account to poor nations the program not the money , since the account has yet to pay out a single dollar is high on the list of talking points for cabinet officials like the united states trade representative , robert zoellick , who visited africa in december and cited the program every chance he got speaking to latin american ambassadors in washington this month , a treasury under secretary , john taylor , hailed it as a major way in which we are working with countries to meet the challenge of increasing productivity growth officials at the millennium challenge account are quick to list the countries that , through good governance , have qualified for the aid program they are not as quick to list the countries that have received a dime there are n't any still , paul applegarth , chief executive of the millennium challenge corporation , assured us last week that president bush s program is really moving at an extraordinarily quick pace maybe the administration should tell that to the 300 million africans who lack safe drinking water , or the 3 , 000 african children under the age of 5 who die every day from malaria , or the 1 in 16 african women who die in childbirth , or the 6 , 000 africans who die each day of aids but wait maybe the president is planning to deal with the african aids catastrophe through his 2003 proposal to increase aids funds by 10 billion over the following five years \? not unless he is planning to finish with a bang , because the white house is expected to ask congress for only 16 billion more next year when added to the amount that aids funds increased in 2004 and 2005 , that would leave a whopping more than 6 billion to get out of congress in the next two years to meet mr bush s pledge congress and mr bush will point to the ballooning deficit and say they do n't have the money but that was a matter of choice they chose to spend billions on tax cuts for the wealthy and the war in iraq they can choose to spend it instead to keep america s promises
landover , md , dec 24 in a little room in the depths of fedex field , giants coach tom coughlin stood on a podium above the news media , calmly discussing a performance that none of the giants could fully explain in midsentence , the sound of a peppy marching band , passing down the hallway , filled the room once again , for the giants , the message was drowned out before the giants lost to the washington redskins , 3520 , they said all the right things they knew a victory would clinch the national football conference east division they knew it would earn them at least one home playoff game but perhaps the backofthemind reality that a loss would not end the season , just add suspense to it was inescapable no matter how many times they told themselves it was a mustwin game , the giants knew it was no such thing but the next one is they played with a different level of intensity , and we did n't match that , giants running back tiki barber said of the redskins , who needed the victory to keep their playoff hopes alive this game was for the season to them , and they came to play that message playing a game to determine the season was supposed to be the mind trick the giants played on themselves instead , the defeat left the giants \( 105 \) with nothing earned but anxiety and more spoken resolve it s hard to get in the position we were in , a chance to clinch the division , the winning record that we had and everything we 've accomplished , center shaun o'hara said and to come down here and not take advantage of that , it s inexcusable the giants may still emerge from the weekend with a wildcard playoff berth assured , if minnesota loses at baltimore on sunday but to win the division and perhaps make the playoffs at all the giants have to beat the raiders in oakland next saturday , or hope the redskins \( 96 \) lose on the road to the philadelphia eagles next sunday the redskins own the tiebreaker with the giants because they have a better divisional record i hope we carry this over to next week and we take it out on oakland , o'hara said that s what i'm hoping for i hope guys look around and say we 've got too good of a team to let something like this i mean , there s got to be a time where we mature as a team , and win games that we 're supposed to win we have n't done that this year the giants were undone by some of what haunted their four previous losses a soft pass defense , a missed field goal , penalties and spoiled scoring chances on the first play from scrimmage , quarterback eli manning threw deep to the open plaxico burress the ball spun burress around and bounced off his hands as he fell in the end zone it was just kind of the way the day went , manning said midway through the fourth quarter , with the giants trying for their latest comeback , manning completed an apparent 36yard touchdown pass to amani toomer but guard chris snee was called for holding , and the giants soon turned the ball over on downs in between those microcosmic events , the teams traded entertaining scoring plays , including an interception return , a halfback pass and a pass tipped by one receiver to another the giants trailed , 2117 , at halftime and held some semblance of momentum , courtesy of a 25yard touchdown pass from manning to toomer with 10 seconds left in the second quarter the ball had ricocheted off the outstretched hands of burress the giants held the redskins to three plays and a punt to open the third quarter , then drove the ball efficiently but they stalled at the 12 , and washington defensive lineman renaldo wynn blocked jay feely s 29yard fieldgoal attempt quarterback patrick ramsey replaced mark brunell , who injured his knee , on the next drive and hit santana moss on a deep slant that became a 72yard touchdown pass it was one of three touchdowns for moss feely s 38yard field goal cut the redskins' lead to 2820 entering the fourth quarter but when the giants needed a defensive stand most , washington running back clinton portis punctuated a 10play drive with a 19yard touchdown run portis finished with 108 yards on 27 attempts barber had 80 yards on 16 carries , the fewest rushes he has had since early october barber had gained a franchiserecord 220 yards against kansas city a week earlier and 206 yards against the redskins on oct 30 we got away from doing what we do best , barber said we did n't run the ball consistently enough manning was 23 of 41 for 244 yards and threw one interception in the second quarter , he threw behind tight end jeremy shockey , who was popped in the chin by redskins linebacker lemar marshall while running his route as shockey turned to an official , the ball whizzed behind him and into the arms of marshall two plays later , portis took a pitch from brunell , sold the play as a run and lobbed a pass to tight end chris cooley for a 17yard score and a 2110 lead shockey left the game with an ankle injury on the giants' next drive , and sat out most of the second half the giants' only lead came when the rookie linebacker chase blackburn intercepted a brunell pass and returned it 31 yards for a touchdown in the first quarter blackburn s day took a frightening turn in the third quarter after making a tackle , he lay immobile on the grass while medical personnel rushed to his side they strapped him to a board and drove him off the field on a cart as blackburn gave a thumb sup sign giants officials called the injury a neck sprain , and blackburn was expected to stay the night in a washingtonarea hospital coughlin s initial postgame remarks were about blackburn , not the game or the playoff chase but then he addressed the issue of his team s spoiled chance as i said to the players , after talking about the way in which we played and not really making the plays that we counted on making , you know , thank god we 've got one more opportunity , coughlin said the band had moved on the message was clear extra points the giants and pro bowl defensive end osi umenyiora agreed to a sixyear contract extension , general manager ernie accorsi said umenyiora s original contract was through 2006 the new deal is worth 33 million , plus incentives , with 15 million guaranteed
jeffrey deitch may spend more time in a wellpressed pinstripe suit than any other downtown art dealer , but he is second to none when it comes to diverting street art s creative energies into the white cube of the traditional gallery at the moment both of mr deitch s white cubes former garages in the relatively quiet southwest quadrant of soho are going full blast with installations by two resourceful streetwise artists , a veteran and a promising newcomer the larger deitch space , on wooster street near grand street , has been taken over by barry mcgee , who helped ignite the streetgraffiti art renaissance that emanated from san francisco in the 1990 s this is his third solo appearance with the gallery , and he has gone all out , venturing into new areas \( abstract painting of all things \) and presenting enough work in drawing , graffiti , video , photography , animatronic sculptures and overthetop installation art for several shows it is aptly titled one more thing meanwhile , around the corner in the smaller deitch space \( on grand near wooster \) , a street artist and recent graduate of pratt institute who calls herself swoon is making her new york gallery debut she is presenting a shadowy stagesetlike reverie on the sidewalks , tenements and elevated subways of new york that was also inspired by the spontaneous , unregulated squatter structures of kowloon walled city , a hong kong slum that was bulldozed in 1993 so far , swoon has been known for the largescale linoleum block prints of expertly drawn city folk that she has been plastering around the lower east side and brooklyn for several years they earned her a place in the greater new york exhibition at ps 1 in queens , where , consistent with her preference for anonymity , her pasteon prints appear unlabeled in an obscure stairwell most people will come across them as on the street , entirely by accident these two environments form a remarkable loop of energy and thought about art and life and the ways they can be merged into a third thing , something highly artificial and visually immersive , yet profoundly real and infused with social commentary they are the work of urban outsider artists whose main subject is the urban outsider mr mcgee s piece operates between extremes of recognizable modernist strategies to evoke society s margins , where subcultures produce their own visual signs and art forms on the one hand he makes grandiose \( and somewhat macho \) use of found objects you enter the show through the back of a large truck turned on its side , to be confronted by a threestoryhigh pileup of wrecked , rusted , heavily graffitied vans , cars and trucks on the other hand , he pursues geometric abstraction with effortless dispatch , covering walls with patchworks of panels painted with fluorescentcolored variations on a threecolor stepped block pattern the eyepopping results update op art while also evoking the subcultures of sign painting and quilt making as for the in between , it is hard to know where to start animatronic figures tag the walls with graffiti some appear to be made of the carved wood african sculptures that street vendors sell others are lifesize replicas of mr mcgee s friends , hoodies and all , including two of the graffiti artist josh one version of josh is sighted in a very convincing recreation of a public restroom that fills a shipping container at the bottom of the wreck pileup he is adding his bestknown tag , amaze , to a graffiticovered mirror meanwhile , videos blaring from a towering kiosk of old television monitors makefurther use of mr mcgee s paintings and the signature sadsack faces and figures of his drawings also here are videos , purchased on the internet , that show members of street gangs brandishing their tattoos and hand signs down some stairs , two walls are covered in beautifully rusted metal plates that turn out to be recycled typesetters trays up other stairs , a small shed lined with metal plates \( trompe l'oeil this time \) leads by ladder to a basement hideaway where the walls are covered with drawings on paper napkins by the artist s father , while the floor is a veritable snake pit of cables and brightly painted dvd players for the videos a third stairway leads to a dense display of mr mcgee s drawings on paper and empty night train bottles along with photographs of graffiti artists in action playing chapel to mr mcgee s cathedral , swoon s relatively intimate , unified installation nonetheless shows her ingeniously parlaying her linoleumblock prints and doilylike paper cutouts into an ambitious walkin environment that is magical in both its complexity and its handson directness intact found objects have little role here , although the piece includes some old doors and bits of molding and ricketylooking wood structures that suggest fire escapes and subway trestles the dominant factor here is a flexible pictorial language that depicts workaday people of diverse ethnicities and urban vistas , often in combination motifs can migrate among printed paper , paper cutout , wood cutout , paint and stencil and there are whiffs of the artist s southern roots \( she was born and brought up in florida \) in the form of frequent silhouettes of trunknosed elephant moths and cutout paper that hangs overhead like spanish moss although a little further along you discover that the hanging cutouts actually depict the coney island cyclone precedents for swoon s work include various forms of 80 s streetoriented art keith haring s chalk figures \( which were also on paper \) , richard hambleton s ab ex figures and martin wong s lovingly exact depictions of tenements and graffiti she also builds on the traditions of the german expressionist woodblock print , american social realism and the slightly heatedup illustrational style of postwar magazines and cheap novel covers there s an implicit conservatism to swoon s style sometimes the piece feels like a visit to the set of west side story but the show creates an engrossing perception of life on the move , conjured up by an artist whose talent is all revved up with lots of places to go at deitch projects , soho barry mcgee s one more thing , at 18 wooster street , and swoon s debut , at 76 grand street , continue through aug 13 \( 212 \) 3437300
the aviator , martin scorsese s sweeping tale of the genius and phobias of howard hughes , took a lead in the oscar race with 11 nominations , including nods for best picture , best director and best actor finding neverland , about the man who wrote the adventures of peter pan , and million dollar baby , an underdog boxing tale , received seven nominations each , including best picture in a year that started with few clear frontrunners and many small films vying for honors , voters in the academy of motion picture arts and sciences turned back to what they have traditionally embraced movies with inspiring themes and heartfelt stories ray , about the singer ray charles , and sideways , about a middleaged man s life crisis played out in the california wine country , were also nominated for best picture controversial films like the passion of the christ , directed by mel gibson , which had three nominations but none in the major categories , and michael moore s political documentary fahrenheit 9 11 , which received no nominations , were largely ignored the aviator , which won nominations for mr scorsese and the actors leonardo dicaprio , cate blanchett and alan alda , as well as the screenwriter john logan , was the most ambitious film among the nominees a threehour tale of howard hughes s personal demons that also reflected hollywood in the 1940 s and the history of commercial aviation it was n't an oddson favorite to even get made , said the film s producer , michael mann , noting that at one point eight films about hughes were being planned we decided on the right story to tell , specifically to try to externalize the internal howard hughes to take his struggles against mental disease on the one hand and his being swept away by his visionary aspect on the other to tell the promise of the man mr dicaprio said this is one of those films that deserves to be recognized it s not the kind of film we get to see every week , or every month or year it s an epic character study it s encouraging to me that more people may finance fascinating character studies on this budget scale the nominations for the aviator and finding neverland plus a best foreign film nomination for the chorus represented a bittersweet victory for miramax , the new yorkbased art house studio whose corporate parent , the walt disney company , is poised to sever ties with miramax s cofounders , harvey and bob weinstein miramax was a codistributor of the aviator , which had a budget of 112 million and received backing from both warner brothers and initial entertainment group as i said to harvey a few week ago , 'if this is the last supper , let s eat , said richard gladstein , a producer of finding neverland and he 'll have an act 2 no one s had an act 1 like this through a spokesman , mr weinstein said , we congratulate our nominees and are thankful that the focus is finally where it should be on the movies sideways , a droll comedy directed by alexander payne , garnered nominations for best picture and best director , as well as supporting acting nods for virginia madsen and thomas haden church , and a nomination for its screenplay , written by mr payne and jim taylor a darling of the critics , it had been expected by many to dominate the awards but failed to win a nomination for its lead actor , paul giamatti jamie foxx , who portrayed ray charles in ray , was nominated for best actor , as was don cheadle , who played a reallife hero who saved tutsis during the 1994 genocide in rwanda in hotel rwanda mr foxx was also nominated for his supporting role in collateral other nominees in the best actor category were johnny depp , as the playwright jm barrie in finding neverland , and clint eastwood for his performance in million dollar baby , which he also directed imelda staunton was nominated for best actress for her role in vera drake , one of the leastseen films in the race , as a british woman who defies the law and social convention in the 1950 s by performing abortions the other nominees in the category were annette bening for being julia , catalina sandino moreno for maria full of grace , kate winslet for eternal sunshine of the spotless mind and hilary swank a previous oscar winner for million dollar baby ms winslet was nominated for portraying a kooky american who is erased from her boyfriend s memory she was such a difficult part to play , said ms winslet , who is british i had to find the right balance of madness and subtlety , which is very , very hard to do , and an american accent , completely changing myself in order to be clementine morgan freeman , who was nominated for best supporting actor for playing a wise exboxer in million dollar baby , mr eastwood s boxing drama , said that it was a lastminute addition to the 2004 release schedule and that warner brothers had initially declined to finance it it was the subject matter , i would think that was the main reason , he said , referring to a surprising plot twist with political undertones that has not generally been discussed in the media so as not to spoil the ending the film was ultimately cofinanced by the production company lakeshore entertainment and warner taylor hackford , the director of ray , observed that having two africanamericans , mr foxx and mr cheadle , nominated for best actor , along with supporting nominations for mr foxx , mr freeman and the black british actress sophie okonedo , might be a sign that racial stigma is becoming a thing of the past in hollywood it s an important time people do n't talk about 'africanamerican , he said we should n't look at it that way when there are great performances on film , they should be recognized this year s directing nominations represented something of a triumph for hollywood s old school four of the nominees are at least 60 mr hackford , nominated for ray mike leigh , nominated for vera drake mr scorsese and mr eastwood , the oldest of the group at 74 among the film industry s newer directors , only mr payne , 43 , was nominated morgan spurlock s super size me , a chronicle of the filmmaker s fate when he went on an allmcdonald s diet , was among the nominees in the documentary category \( mr moore asked that fahrenheit 9 11 not be considered in that category \) a year ago mr spurlock brought super size me to the sundance film festival we made this little film for 65 , 000 now it s played in 60 countries , he said i do n't have one debt in my life now , and that s a beautiful thing he added that he was making an educationally

jim dine is one of the most wellknown american artists of the past 40 years and an originator of pop art but in many reviews , critics express frustration with his classicism and lack of originality slick recycler , or words to that effect , recur often in the literature jim dine some drawings at the neuberger museum of art in purchase is a pleasantenough exhibition , corralling some 84 drawings in watercolor , charcoal , enamel , pastel and other media from the 1960 s to the present but it does nothing to persuade us that the artist , now 70 , is anything other than a skillful copier of other images and objects the selection of works offers a sort of mini history of the artist s development , showing off the range of technical process he has used many early drawings , for instance , include collage , while later pieces reveal the artist daringly combining materials and media in unexpected ways but more often than not the content is feeble , and often repetitive classical sculpture , hearts , birds and skulls leaving the images listless and flat there is nothing fresh or even fizzy about them where mr dine excels , i think , is when he allows spontaneity to dictate subject matter and style there are not too many examples of this here , but one that struck me was untitled \( shell \) \( 198184 \) , a messy painting of a shell against a murky , splashy ground somehow mutually repellent values of culture and nature seem aligned , even one cy twombly is a source of comparison for mr dine here , if only insofar as he is one of the few contemporary artists who can consistently infuse drawing with a sense of primal energy mr dine , i think , is capable of such feats , but his tendency is always toward more romantic , stylized and often classical imagery , rather than , like mr twombly , allowing his imagination to run wild and free it is what holds him back take , for instance , midsummer , paris \( 2002 \) , a work gracing the pricey hardbound catalog accompanying the show the choice and application of mixed media is inspired , but the subject matter , a garden scene of some kind with white orchids , is so clich \? even nauseatingly sentimental , that you wonder at its meaning my guess is that there is none mr dine is a conservative artist playing at being avantgarde nudes are also in abundance here , but mostly they are lifeless and stiff there is no intimacy , or no erotic magma bubbling up from within in fact , there is no heat at all they are cold , distant and sterile , which is understandable , given that mr dine is often drawing statues this exhibition coincides with several others of the artist s work in regional galleries , including a brief survey of his prints at the center for contemporary printmaking in norwalk this exhibition , selected by anthony kirk , the center s artistic director and a noted master printmaker , aims to please mostly , it consists of images of flowers , birds and hearts mr dine s prints are among his most accomplished works this is partly because it is a graphic medium and he has a love of drawing , not to mention a great facility , and partly because he has a longstanding passion for the art of printmaking he has worked over the years with many of the world s best master printmakers , and experimented widely with all kinds of printing processes and techniques he knows this craft accomplished prints in many media are here , among them a stark , simple etching and drypoint , cold mountain \( 1994 \) an appealing handcolored lithograph , watercolor zerkall \( 2004 \) and a lush lithograph and woodcut , two hearts in the forest \( 1981 \) but it is all too pretty for my taste , and is mostly decorative work cranked out to feed the market mr dine is among the art world s most prolific printmakers he has produced close to 900 print editions over the course of his career few are masterpieces , but several , like those of hearts and the armless torso of the venus de milo , have earned a toehold in the pantheon of last century s recognized art images the question is will they be remembered \? jim dine some drawings is at the neuberger museum of art , 735 anderson hill road , purchase college , purchase , ny , through jan 8 information \( 914 \) 2516100 or www neuberger org from hearts to flowers jim dine , a print survey is at the center for contemporary printmaking , mathews park , 299 west avenue , norwalk , , through nov 18 information \( 203 \) 8997999 or on the web at www contemprints org photo two hearts in the forest , 1981 , a lithograph and woodcut , and watercolor zerkal , 2004 , a lithograph with hand coloring , by jim dine
just as you ca n't put the genie back in the bottle , george steinbrenner has learned that you ca n't put the word steroids back in the contract at a yankees workout in tampa , fla , on saturday , steinbrenner explained that his distaste for jason giambi s agent , arn tellem , had to do with tellem having interrupted giambi s news conference on feb 10 to say that the united states attorney s office in san francisco had instructed giambi not to comment on his grand jury testimony about steroids the court told jason that he could say anything he wanted to , steinbrenner growled to reporters saturday the court gave him permission and arn tellem says no , he does n't he does n't say anything later in that conversation with reporters , steinbrenner said that tellem was no good i'm not happy with him i do n't like him , steinbrenner added tellem was in tampa to negotiate an extension of outfielder hideki matsui s contract \( tellem also represents the yankees' mike mussina \) he appeared surprised when informed of steinbrenner s words i do n't take anything by that comment , tellem said other than , i guess , most owners would say that about agents but for anyone familiar with steinbrenner s history , his anger with tellem goes much deeper it involves tellem having outfoxed the yankees' negotiators , who agreed to tellem s request that all references to steroids be removed from the guaranteeexclusion language in giambi s sevenyear , 120 million contract that tellem obtained in december 2001 during his grand jury testimony in the federal steroids investigation , giambi admitted having used steroids before signing his contract with the yankees , according to the san francisco chronicle had the yankees not removed the word steroids from giambi s contract , they could have argued that he had abrogated his deal had the yankees won that argument with major league baseball , they may have been able to release giambi , thereby saving the 82 million remaining on his contract and to steinbrenner , 82 million saved is 82 million earned steinbrenner s outburst saturday reminded yankees historians of his resentment of outfielder dave winfield over the contract he signed as a free agent in 1980 a 1 million signing bonus , an annual salary of 14 million for 10 years and costofliving increases that would have made the total value about 23 million several million more than steinbrenner figured until the deal was renegotiated despite winfield s consistent production for the yankees in his hall of fame career , steinbrenner never forgave winfield and his agent , al frohman , for outfoxing the yankees with that costofliving clause in hopes of discrediting winfield , steinbrenner paid 40 , 000 in 1990 to howard spira , an admitted gambler , to provide information damaging to winfield regarding finances at winfield s charitable foundation after an investigation into steinbrenner s relationship with spira , commissioner fay vincent banned steinbrenner from having any involvement in the management or daytoday operations of the team in his decision , vincent wrote that steinbrenner knew the payment to spira was illadvised , and that he knew the payment , if exposed , would look bad and bring disrepute to him and therefore to baseball and , as a result , vincent wrote in one of the most damning phrases of the decision , efforts were made to cover it up in essence , he heard no internal warnings because none went off , vincent wrote , alluding to steinbrenner s conscience spira later was convicted for trying to extort money from steinbrenner and was sentenced to 30 months in prison steinbrenner , meanwhile , rejected vincent s original proposal of a twoyear suspension , instead negotiating a ban from the yankees , which could have been permanent , because he thought a suspension would jeopardize his vice presidency on the united states olympic committee he was reinstated by vincent after two and a half years but for all of steinbrenner s anger over giambi s contract and dislike for tellem , he was careful to show support for giambi with a halfhug in front of photographers saturday at the yankees' workout while indicating , at least publicly , that the yankees were not trying to void giambi s contract , steinbrenner told reporters we 're pretty much behind him i hope that he has a good year but what does pretty much behind giambi mean \? to anyone familiar with steinbrennerspeak , it sounded as if he realized that , for better or for worse , he s stuck not only with giambi s contract but with giambi himself , and let s make the best of it steinbrenner also realized that he had learned something from the winfield years blame the agent , not the player to rip giambi would be dumb especially considering how sensitive giambi is to the steroids scandal that surrounds him and to returning from ailments that contributed to his diminished production last season , when he hit 208 with 12 homers and 40 runs batted in if giambi is to regain the power and the pride that he enjoyed as the american league s most valuable player with the oakland athletics in 2000 , he needs all the support he can get at least publicly what steinbrenner really thinks about jason giambi is something else but at least it s known what steinbrenner really thinks of arn tellem
with traffic congestion already smothering fairfield county , probably the last thing motorists want is another road construction project on a major highway well , get ready the state s department of transportation is scheduled to award a contract next month for a 90 million renovation of the merritt parkway where it intersects main avenue and the route 7 connector in norwalk a completion date has not been set , but a department manager estimated that it would be in 2011 or 2012 the project will fix what is a confusing array of ramps , and lack of ramps , leading off and on the merritt parkway in norwalk the manager , thomas a harley , said a full set of ramps for the connector was never completed when it was built 15 years ago because money was not available the connector was part of a project , dubbed super 7 , that was to link norwalk and danbury with an expanded , multilane route 7 , a project that was never completed mr harley said new ramps leading onto main avenue from both directions of the parkway will be built also being added will be some new ramps between the connector and the merritt now , westbound drivers exiting the merritt and headed to the connector have to take main avenue to get there after the project , there will be direct access between the merritt and the connector in all directions mr harley said the plan was to keep all the lanes open on the parkway in rush hours however , he said lanes could be closed during offpeak hours ultimately , there is always some construction activity that leads to rubbernecking and gawking , he said laurie heiss , the executive director of the merritt parkway conservancy , a nonprofit organization that helps preserve the road , said she believed traffic would be affected my sense is that it has to slow down traffic , she said i imagine they would have mandatory slowdowns through a construction zone j paul vance , a spokesman for the state police , said the department anticipated some problems because of the project any time there is any kind of construction that disrupts the normal operational flow of traffic , people will make mistakes , and the end result is that many times accidents will occur , he said the biggest concern for ms heiss is the look of the merritt , which is listed on the national register of historic places she said she was troubled by the size and height of some of the ramps , the demolition and replacement of the parkway bridge over main avenue and the building of a new bridge over one of the new ramps it will change the character of the parkway forever in that part of norwalk , she said it will have none of the vegetation that is there now you will have views from the roadway into commercial areas , homes and residences and with the additional lighting , you 'll be able to see the parkway from quite a distance ms heiss also said the new ramps may not be necessary because the connector was never extended to danbury had there been a super 7 continuation to danbury , it might have made sense , she said but as it is , this entire design is hoping for the super 7 to go through someday otherwise , it makes no sense mr harley said the project was still important and that the new ramps would make using the connector easier he also said the department has done its best to maintain the parkway s character he said the plans have been seen by the merritt parkway advisory board , a private group set up by the dot to monitor what happens to the parkway alex knopp , the mayor of norwalk , said the connector could be extended to danbury in the future he said the merritt project was needed to take traffic off local roads near the parkway this area is right smack in the middle of the largest class a office park in the whole state of connecticut , and maybe new england , he said mr knopp said critics should back the project we do n't want to see anything happen that will jeopardize it , he said there are a lot of johnnycomelatelies who want to redesign it but even if their ideas are good , the impact would be to shelve it and possibly permanently kill it and that would be unacceptable photo a merritt makeover the parkway where it intersects main avenue and the route 7 connector in norwalk \( photo by morgan kaolian aeropix \)
good morning , ladies and gentlemen for those of you who do n't know me , i am shyam das , and i am the arbitrator in this case , the boston red sox vs doug mientkiewicz this grievance is about ownership of a baseball , and i 'd like to go directly to the heart of the dispute i think we can save a lot of time if the red sox' representatives can answer one question do you have a receipt for the baseball that shows when you bought it and how much you paid for it \? oh , you have no receipt \? do you have anything that shows ownership of that particular baseball , the one that was used for the last out of your 2004 world series championship \? i see you are claiming ownership of the ball , but you have nothing that says you own this ball , that you bought it , paid for it and gave it to the umpire to use when edgar renteria came to bat with two out in the ninth inning of the fourth game of the series i do n't see how you expect me to award the ball to you without any such proof of ownership i do n't expect mr mientkiewicz to have a receipt for the ball even if i were not baseball s impartial arbitrator , i would know that players do n't pay for the baseballs they play with what i do know is that 52 , 037 fans at busch stadium and millions more on television saw mr mientkiewicz catch that ball for the final out of the world series although i do n't know for certain , i would expect that the owners of the red sox mr henry , mr werner and mr lucchino saw mr mientkiewicz catch that ball they certainly had a large stake in witnessing that final out unless they tell me otherwise , i doubt seriously that at the instant the ball went into the first baseman s glove , any of these gentlemen thought that s our baseball we have to make sure to get it from doug so that we can proudly exhibit it throughout new england and put it in a special case at fenway park from what i understand and we will hear testimony to this if we need to none of the boston owners or officials even thought about the ball until about 10 weeks later , when they were asked about it for a newspaper column by a mr dan shaughnessy of the boston globe if i owned something that was part of such a historic october moment , i 'd want to claim it right away , not ignore it , then wake up one day in january and say , hey , that s ours what if mr mientkiewicz had not kept the ball \? what if he had tossed it into the stands to a fan or into the ball bag , where it would have become mixed with dozens of other baseballs , never to be identified as the ball \? you would n't have much of a case then , would you \? instead of challenging mr mientkiewicz for the baseball , you should be expressing gratitude that he preserved it and let you have it for a year how many red sox fans have been able to see the ball because mr mientkiewicz did n't toss it into the ball bag \? if he had reacted as the rest of you did and had not thought about the ball , it would be gone and you 'd have nothing to claim ownership of if mr shaughnessy had n't written about the ball , you would n't have thought about it and claimed ownership now i 've already established that you have no proof of ownership , but in case you have qualms about my view , let me raise another issue you say you own the ball is your name on it \? does it say boston red sox \? is john henry s john hancock on the ball \? no and no the only name on the ball is allan h selig , the commissioner of baseball , so maybe he owns the ball his office paid for that ball and all the other ones used in the world series if you want to argue that a team , and not the commissioner or an individual player , owns the world series baseballs , you would then have to acknowledge that the baseballs used in the fourth game belonged to the cardinals , the home team the red sox were n't the home team you were the visitors so even on that basis , you have no claim to the ball all of that said , i will offer you one opportunity to gain proprietorship of the ball tell me what happened to the baseballs used for the last outs in 50 previous world series do the fielders who caught the balls have them \? did they give them to the finishing pitchers \? did they toss them into the stands or drop them into ball bags \? this year s last ball , which paul konerko gave to jerry reinsdorf , the white sox' owner , does n't count because the dispute over the 2004 ball alerted everyone to the issue in conclusion , i direct the red sox to return the ball to mr mientkiewicz , and i suggest that the red sox grow up and quit fighting over a baseball they have more important things to do , like trying to win again soon , so their fans do n't have to wait another 86 years
you really hate to pound on a company whose shares are trading at 30 cents , but independence air set itself up i mean , what genius came up with the idea of joining up with the laugh factory , a comedy club , just as the airline was teetering on the edge of bankruptcy \? a little background is in order before i give you my report on the ride that independence air took me for last week independence air started operations in june 2004 at washington dulles international airport this had the effect of frightening united airlines , the airport s prime tenant , into reducing its skyhigh fares on routes it shared with the upstart competitor overnight , a lowfare bonanza for shorthaul trips occurred at dulles so far , so good independence air s intrusion at dulles was born from a grudge the carrier started in 1989 as atlantic coast airlines , which supplied regionaljet service under contract to united and , later , to delta airlines as well in 2002 , united went into bankruptcy and demanded price concessions from its various regionaljet contract airlines atlantic coast refused , and muttered byebye to united like a flight attendant at the arrival gate atlantic coast restructured itself as independence air , under a new corporate name , flyi inc , and entered the lowfare airline game timing being the essence both of airline innovation and of comedy , let s just say that independence air s was a bit off those cramped 50seat regional jets it flies are not only unpopular with passengers , they 're also gas guzzlers , not a good thing with oil trading above 67 late last week independence air later acquired some longerrange , more fuelefficient and more comfortable airbus a319 planes \( it now has 12 \) and used them to expand into the most brutal domestic air fare market of all coasttocoast flights the result has not been funny last week , in a conference call with securities analysts , kerry b skeen , the chief executive , conceded that the west coast flying has been a real challenge it s a very difficult fare environment to which a comedian might reply duh \? but none of this had occurred to me two weeks ago when i booked a oneway flight on independence air from newark to los angeles normally , when i fly to los angeles , i fly continental airlines , which keeps its transcontinental fares competitively low out of its newark hub the independence air press release about its partnership with the laugh factory had intrigued me enough to book but my oneway fare on this selfdescribed lowfare airline was 36790 and required a connection through dulles the same fare booked at the same time on continental , a fullservice airline , would have been 30930 and on a nonstop from newark ok , but independence was offering those laughs , right \? on aug 1 , the airline had announced a partnership with the laugh factory , which operates comedy clubs in hollywood and new york , to offer comedy shows on flights given that independence air was almost simultaneously announcing a 985 million secondquarter loss and warning investors that bankruptcy was a real possibility and liquidation was n't out of the question , that struck me as what ralph kramden would have called a regular riot my independence air flight , on a crowded schoolbuslike 50seat regional jet , left newark last tuesday around 6 10 pm , more than an hour late , with no information about the delay or its cause at dulles , after a quartermile sprint with bags in hand , i barely made the 7 15 pm connection to los angeles the airbus a319 to los angeles was quite comfortable , an allcoach configuration with three seats on either side of the aisle and all 132 of them giving passengers 33 inches of legroom , compared with the standard 31 inches in most coach cabins having missed dinner , i wolfed down the snacks offered basically , some crackers and a bag of chips the comedy was on hardcoverbooksize video players , which the flight attendants peddle off a cart for 10 the offerings included 11 pgrated movies , none of which appealed to me there were also canned television programs , audio tracks and , of course , the heralded standup comedy on stage from the laugh factory alas , these routines were so heavily censored that some of the jokes made no sense i'm never going to be a star on independence air ! one of the comedians lamented on the video after a comment she made was bleeped the lead act on the laugh factory stage was dave george , an actual independence air baggage handler who moonlights as a comedian with the stage name the flyi guy and wears headphones and a reflective vest on stage i have some advice for him do n't quit your night job , dave
washington , july 29 representative don young , alaska s lone congressman , flew home happy on friday for the august recess the highway legislation that passed the house on thursday night and the senate around sundown on friday , the most expensive public works bill in the nation s history , has almost 1 billion for special projects in alaska about onefourth of that money will be spent to build one of the biggest bridges in the united states , a milelong , 200foothigh span that will connect ketchikan , a town with fewer than 8 , 000 people , to an island that has 50 residents and a small airport another 230 million will be spent on a bridge across an inlet in anchorage , and it will be named don young s way and as an added sweetener for mr young , a republican who is chairman of the house transportation and infrastructure committee , the bill includes almost 3 million to produce a documentary film about infrastructure that demonstrates advancements in alaska , the last frontier like so much else in the bill , the money for the documentary was added by a few senior senators and representatives who met in private as a conference committee to reconcile the differences between the house and senate versions of the legislation the mammoth legislation was not available for public inspection until just before the votes , and it is safe to bet that none of lawmakers , not even the main authors , had read the entire package a few lawmakers , including two arizona republicans , senator john mccain and representative jeff flake , were critical of the process i have never seen anything quite like this , said mr mccain , who took to the senate floor just before the final vote and proceeded to identify a few of the projects that caught his eye , like a parking facility in peoria , ill , and a special tax break for some seaplanes but most senators and representative boasted of the bacon they had managed to bring home speaker j dennis hastert said he was pleased with financing that he had arranged for bridges in his illinois district i have one of the highestgrowth counties in the country i also have a river that flows through it , mr hastert told reporters we need to have development and growth , and there is money to do that senator edward m kennedy , democrat of massachusetts , interrupted a news conference he was having on president bush s nominee for the supreme court , judge john g roberts , to brag to reporters listening on a speakerphone in massachusetts about the 330 million in special highway projects in his home state as for mr young , he got out of town before he could be interviewed but asked last year why so much money out of the highway budget should be poured into his state , he said , this is the time to take advantage of the position i'm in the special projects , called earmarks in congressional terminology , amount to 24 billion in a 2864 billion bill , financed by fuel taxes , that covers highway spending over six years the rest of the money is allocated to the states according to a formula that takes into account population , road mileage and other elements clearly not all , maybe not even most , of the earmarked money goes for unworthy projects for example , few would begrudge financing for the brent spence bridge in cincinnati , which carries 150 , 000 vehicles every weekday and is badly in need of repair the problem is that there is no way to know what s worthy and what s not , said tom schatz , president of citizens against government waste , a budget watchdog organization there s not a competitive review or any real process keith ashdown , vice president of taxpayers for common sense , another watchdog group , said setting aside a part of the money in the bill for pet projects takes transportation spending out of the hands of local experts who know what the needs are and puts it into the hands of politicians almost all members of congress got some project or another in their district in what he called the pork pecking order , mr ashdown calculated that in addition to the nearly 1 billion that went to mr young s district , which is all of alaska , the district of the senior democrat on the transportation and infrastructure committee , james l oberstar of minnesota , can count on about 150 million other senior committee members got 60 million to 90 million , and junior members got about 40 million for their constituents the average allocation , mr ashdown said , was about 16 million per district some of the budget cost in the bill has nothing to do with highways there is , for instance , a new income tax credit for wholesalers of distilled spirits but most of the money is for construction projects and the associated general contractors of america issued a statement saying the trade association was pleased with the outcome no one has compiled a concise list of all the earmarked projects mr flake , the arizona congressman , put out what he said was a sampler , including 42 million for intermodal transportation at the philadelphia zoo , 12 million for a pedestrian bicycle access project in newark and 13 million for a day care center and parkandride facility in champaign , ill among the projects financed in new york are hospital parking in harlem for 8 million , improving a pedestrian walkway and bikeway in coney island for 26 million , and intermodal transportation at the bronx zoo with three different expenditures
when norman pearlstine , the editor in chief of time inc , decided early this summer that matthew cooper , a reporter for time magazine , should testify before a grand jury in the cia leak case , mr pearlstine s no 2 , john huey , was uncharacteristically circumspect about what he would have done , had he been in his boss s shoes a lot of people wanted to know , especially in the magazine s washington bureau , which felt hung out to dry by mr pearlstine s decision it was a defining moment for time and mr huey , as mr pearlstine s heir apparent , would soon be in the position of making such decisions himself now he is time inc , a division of time warner , the world s largest media company , is to announce today that mr huey , 57 , will succeed mr pearlstine , 63 , on jan 1 this makes mr huey the sixth editor in chief of the storied magazine empire since henry r luce published the first issue of time in 1923 \( though mr luce did not assume the title of editor in chief until the 1940 s \) so the question was put to mr huey in an interview last week would he have had mr cooper testify before the grand jury \? yes , he said , he would have reached the same conclusion as mr pearlstine but with two caveats if i know then everything i know now , he said , more than three months after the fact , and if i'm faced with exactly the same situation and data , then yes , i make the same decision the answer showed , beyond loyalty to mr pearlstine , the degree of mind meld between the two as they stake out a position unpopular among many journalists they have worked together for 17 of the last 25 years , starting at the wall street journal , and mr pearlstine has been grooming mr huey as his successor since appointing him four years ago as editorial director they have been the astaire and rogers of publishing , so in sync as they swept across the floor of the house of luce that it was not always clear who was leading john has been running this magazine group with norm , so it s hard to tell where one s point of view ends and the other s begins , said eric pooley , whom the two executives installed earlier this year as managing editor of fortune as a result , the transfer of power to mr huey will be just the way time inc likes it barely perceptible to its 13 , 500 employees or to the nearly two of every three american adults who read at least one of time inc s 155 magazines every month moreover , the huey era is likely to bear a strong resemblance to the 11year pearlstine era , down to mr huey s grooming of his own successor who , if the hosannas from the 34th floor of the time life building are any indication , is likely to be martha nelson , 53 , the managing editor of people magazine i do n't think you 'll see a lot of change , said don logan , chairman of time warner s media and communications group it s an orderly transition that has been planned out and thought out for some time and it s not like john is moving into a situation that s broken and needs to be fixed but that is not to say that everything will stay the same the challenges facing mr huey , an assertive and opinionated fellow , in an increasingly competitive and strained financial environment are different from those that have faced mr pearlstine the bottomline pressures at time inc are no secret , said mark whitaker , editor of newsweek , time magazine s crosstown competitor and they are particularly intense now , given carl icahn s involvement and interest in getting the stock price up , he said , referring to pressure for corporate revamping by mr icahn , the investor who has increased his stake in time warner but for anybody in this business , mr whitaker said , the big challenges are how do you continue to keep print magazines exciting and viable while also taking advantage of the web \? how do you attract younger readers \? and what can we do to make the strongest possible case to the advertising community \? john is in the same boat with everyone else in trying to figure those things out mr huey , a native georgian with a slow drawl , seems to be trying not to make waves as he takes the helm my main vision and this sounds like i'm more of a marketer than an editor , but so what \? is making sure the power of the brand stays as vital as it can , he said in the interview in his office , which he will soon trade in for mr pearlstine s grand corner lair and who will take mr huey s nonetooshabby digs \? no one for now , he said i have to spend time sorting out what life is like without norm , he said besides , he added , ms nelson , whom he called a creative genius and a great manager , is very , very valuable right where she is but few doubt that mr huey will sooner or later expand her portfolio to include more of the lifestyle magazines , time inc s profit centers , and put her on a path to become the company s first female editor in chief for years , the publishing division of time warner , which is mostly magazines but includes books , has been immensely profitable according to time warner s earnings report for the first half of this year , the division accounted for 27 billion of the company s total revenue of 212 billion this is the smallest amount generated by one of its five divisions , and yet it generates 10 percent of its operating income , before depreciation and amortization the division consistently makes money , led by the phenomenal financial success of people magazine , which accounts for about 15 percent of time inc s profit if you take people magazine out of time inc , we are a rather ordinary magazine company , mr pearlstine said it s what gives us the superior performance but growth at some other magazines has slowed or is flat problems include sluggish advertising , uncertainty over the sources of future growth and an inability to make headway online mr huey said that time , the flagship publication , for instance , needs a little pump richard greenfield of fulcrum global partners , a publishing industry analyst , said that time inc is a good solid business today and has had reasonable growth over a very long period of time , but the average 12 or 21yearold is n't picking up magazines in addition , he said , the company s print division was hampered by its online division , aol , which features news generated by media outlets besides time inc how do you make time magazine into a killer brand online if you are offering these other brands \? mr greenfield asked magazines like people and instyle may have a very long life , given that it s hard to replicate that experience online but for the less femaleskewing , less fashion and less gossipy publications , we 're increasingly concerned about where they are going with news , people do n't want to read it a week late mr logan said he expected profit to be up again this year but the company was nonetheless in a difficult period as a result , he said , he expected tighter cost efficiencies and fewer new magazines time inc has essentially had a hiring freeze for the last four years mr huey said the slowed growth in company profit was already forcing him to think about job cuts it s premature for me to say how it comes out , but it s in the air , he added he also said advertisers had become more aggressive about trying to get lower rates and embed their products in magazines in ways that did not immediately identify them as ads the pressure is extraordinary , he said but , he added , we have to be open to some of these kinds of things in newsmagazines that are trying to present the unvarnished truth , mr huey said , he would never consider such a thing but in others , we would work to figure out if the consumer would be comfortable and if it did n't denigrate our brand of journalism ann s moore , chairwoman and chief executive of time inc , said mr huey s main task would be to pick the editors to run the magazines his real test , she said , is who s his team she said she did not anticipate immediate turnover at the major publications most of those editors are relatively new but , she said , there are magazines that need reinventing and redesigning , and there will be turnover replacing editors is a sore subject for mr huey , who fired four of his shortly after becoming editorial director in 2001 , a messy period chronicled in an unflattering article in gq mr pearlstine said many of those decisions were his , although mr huey was blamed while mr huey disputes many details in that article and acknowledges that he can be blunt and sarcastic , he said he had learned to modify his behavior the further up you get in an organization like this , he said , the more weight people put on your words for all of the symbiosis between mr pearlstine and mr huey , there are differences mr pearlstine is something of an international jetsetter mr huey has avoided what he calls the media swirl mr huey s family lives in south carolina , to which he commutes regularly since his use of company planes for that purpose was criticized , he now takes commercial flights mr pearlstine said they also had different instincts i have that newspaper instinct that says you put your most important story on the cover , he said john has the instinct that the cover is a marketing document and while they emerged on the same side in the cooper case , they arrived in different ways mr pearlstine , who was trained as a lawyer , said the decision was the most difficult he faced in more than three decades in journalism he pored over case law and buttonholed academics , he said , before concluding essentially that no one is above the law mr huey is more of a gutlevel pragmatist i was never the intellectual champion of the decision in the way he was , mr huey said of mr pearlstine , because i'm not a lawyer and i'm not an intellectual but i'm not an idiot either he said he would have done what mr pearlstine did because he learned in the last three months that mr pearlstine s decision did not destroy the credibility of time magazine , as some had feared moreover , he said , if you look at how the opposite decision is playing out , referring to the decision by judith miller , a reporter for the new york times , to go to jail rather than testify in the case , only to emerge from jail 85 days later to testify , i'm not sure what that proves what are the lessons from that \? a notable difference between the two is that mr huey loves being a handson editor i was a guy who liked to write headlines and picture captions and move things around and choose covers , he said there was a tradition in the old days when the editor in chief would edit a magazine for a couple of cycles norm never did that , and as to whether i would ever revive that tradition , i do n't know but i certainly would be comfortable doing that i like editing magazines it would be fun to get back in the car and ride around the track a couple of times
'l'eclisse' released in 1962 , l'eclisse \( the eclipse \) followed l'avventura \( 1960 \) and la notte \( 1961 \) as the concluding film in michelangelo antonioni s trilogy on alienation and desire it is the most radical film of a highly experimental group , and as time passes it increasingly seems to be the most pure and perfect expression of mr antonioni s pioneering modernist sensibility both l'avventura and la notte are reluctant narratives that seem ready to wander away from their ostensible story lines \( a woman disappears on a yachting trip , a milanese couple struggle with their disintegrating marriage \) and lose themselves in the objects and textures that surround the characters in l'eclisse , mr antonioni completes his break with storytelling the film begins as vittoria , a roman translator played by monica vitti , ends her relationship with a passive , brooding novelist \( francisco rabal \) , and ends as vittoria seemingly runs out on a budding relationship with a hyperactive , unreflective stock trader \( alain delon \) but vittoria s gaze the extension of mr antonioni s own frequently turns away from the melodramatic matters at hand , becoming lost in the arrangements of items on a table , transfixed by a bit of wood bobbing in a waterfilled barrel , or drawn away to the treetops and mysterious towers that surround her apartment building in an eerily empty fascistera suburb it s as if vittoria , and the film along with her , was shrugging off her narrative responsibilities , taking a vacation from meaning and emotion by drifting into the peaceful , blissful world of indifferent nature and inanimate objects one haunting sequence finds vittoria wandering around a small private airport in verona , a selfcontained world of sun , grass and solitude that may be mr antonioni s idea of heaven on earth hitting the freeze button at almost any point in the superbly mounted dvd of l'eclisse that the criterion collection is releasing today yields an impeccably composed still photograph , suitable for framing but mr antonioni , who continues to film today at the age of 92 despite being rendered mute and partly paralyzed by a stroke in 1985 , is no mere pictorialist it is the succession of images that matters , and never more so than in the famous final seven minutes of l'eclisse , a montage of some of the places and things fleetingly associated with vitti and delon s flirtation the stars of the film simply vanish , and the outcome of the story along with them , as mr antonioni emerges himself in a flow of apparently trivial images \( a bus unloading passengers , a halffinished building tantalizingly shrouded in tarpaulins \) that lead to the eclipse of the title a street lamp that suddenly flares into searing brightness , and then goes dark a preceding shot of a newspaper headline , describing the fragile peace between the nuclear superpowers of the time , suggests that we may be witnessing a nuclear holocaust but in another sense , the world seems finally to have eclipsed its human inhabitants , driving their petty emotional problems off the screen and out of consciousness only material reality remains , impassive and majestic the criterion doubledisc set includes alternate track commentary by richard pe a of the new york film festival , a pair of fine essays by the critics jonathan rosenbaum and gilberto perez , and an

attack of the sabretooth bloodsuckers the man with the screaming brain and , most indelible of all , mansquito a combination of outrageous genre concepts , lowbudget filmmaking and sensationalized titles like the roll call above are all part of the sci fi channel s attempt to establish a presence on saturday nights , when a good number of potential viewers are out , asleep or watching reruns the programming strategy has been a major success , with numbers that far exceed anyone s expectations alien apocalypse , sci fi s biggest saturday hit , attracted 27 million viewers in march that may be a pittance for cbs or nbc , but it constitutes a major audience for a niche network and besides , said steve sternberg , a television analyst at magnaglobal usa , friday and saturday have become very weak nights for the broadcast networks , which , he explained , have not been able to draw enough viewers with original entertainment series cable networks can flourish with much smaller audiences original horror and scifi movies seem like the perfect programming for saturday night they 're good at the 'd' word , demographics , said bruce campbell , a star of b movies who also wrote , directed and starred in the screaming brain film , to be shown in september i think they 're micromarketing , he said , which in this fragmented world makes sense they 're saying , 'who s at home on saturday night \? ' the answer might be surprising nearly half of sci fi s audience is female , and in the highly soughtafter 25to54yearold demographic category , sci fi is the no4 basic cable network on saturdays , behind tnt , usa and tbs sci fi s foray into saturday night mayhem began in 2002 , when network executives realized that cheap , independently made genre pictures , an important element of their programming mix , were hardly being produced any more so , said tom vitale , the sci fi channel s senior vice president for original movies we had a choice of recycling older movies or going out and trying to create original movies ourselves we went back to these producers who made genre movies , and asked them if they wanted to make them with us people like ken badish jumped at the chance mr badish s company , active entertainment , will have produced nine sci fi movies by the end of 2005 , highconcept features like mansquito \( experiment gone awry creates manmosquito hybrid ! \) , and alien lockdown \( government science produces horrific slime thing ! \) the most important element of a sci fi film , mr badish said , is a topical film that has relevance to our audience in a film coming up , he added , stem cells are key to the plot in another , it s mad cow disease secondly , there s a good story like we 're shooting a 'jaws'kind of movie featuring a giant squid we make a reasonable use of cgi , because the audience wants that escapist thing and we add emotional content , so the audience can feel for the characters often that amounts to borrowing shamelessly from works like alien , the fly and the thing and then adding ideas gleaned from scientific american or wired shot on budgets ranging from 1 million to 2 million , sci fi s movies are made in moneysaving locales like bulgaria , romania and missouri they 're cast with blist celebrities like luke perry and stephen baldwin , with the occasional bigpicture actors sean astin and john rhysdavies of lord of the rings making an appearance the network pays 750 , 000 for domestic tv rights , and the producers make their money back through international and dvd sales but are the films any good \? critics have not found much to praise , though some seem to have tried pretty hard virginia heffernan of the new york times said chupacabra dark seas \( monster runs amok on a cruise liner ! \) was founded on broad clich s , overacted and clumsily blocked but she added that the casting of serious actors like mr rhysdavies and giancarlo esposito provides evidence of selfrespect , that someone has tried to make a coherent , passionate and traditional b movie entertainment weekly opened one of its reviews by noting , there are better things on tonight , but none are called 'mansquito ' the critics' disfavor does n't seem to bother the folks behind the films , who have no pretensions to high art bonnie hammer , the sci fi channel president , likes to refer to the pictures as popcorn movies for those who love the genre , adding , viewers come for the ride it s a guilty pleasure jeff beach , whose unified film organization has made 20 films for the network , calls them highconcept actionadventure movies with elements that are fun , whether a creature or a disaster b movies do n't mean bad , said mr campbell , who starred in the classic evil dead films they 're just operating on a limited budget and are trying to be entertaining you go to the sci fi channel , you see a highenergy thing and viewers are seeing a lot of them the channel produced one original movie in 2002 this year there will be 23 next year , 28 that s more than some major studios produce , and at a bargain basement price of 21 million total coming soon heat stroke \( aliens are producing global warming ! \) , magma \( government project goes awry earth s core begins to overheat ! \) and black hole terror \( black hole threatens to swallow the midwest ! \) sci fi has also announced fire alien , a firebreathing alien feature starring who else \? william shatner even internet hoaxes can lead to sci fi movie ideas last april , a bogus report circulated about a strain of malaria that quickly killed its victims and then restarted their hearts , turning them into violent zombies for several hours now in development at the sci fi channel a movie with the possible titles zombie resurrection or revenge of the undead all this , and the promotional budget is virtually nil in traditional movies of the week you would have to promote it and market it each week , ms hammer said we have a builtin audience our fans will come to us first , so we do n't have to market it but , mr vitale added , sci fi is also trying to reach a mainstream tv audience he added look at cbs they did spring break shark attack' we are sort of zigging where the other networks are zagging if you are home on saturday night , you are looking for that escapist experience
john f welch jr s image as the iconic american chief executive took a hit when his second wife , jane beasley welch , revealed the goody basket of corporate perks he walked away with from free rent for a manhattan apartment to flowers and reimbursement for cleaning bills when he retired from the general electric corporation but that has n't stopped people from wanting mr welch s business advice his most recent book , winning , has sold an estimated 440 , 000 copies since it came out in april , making it a bona fide best seller he wrote the book with his current wife , suzy welch , whom he married after a highly publicized affair mr welch is clearly benefiting from his business cachet , as well as a demand among readers for business advice a number of publishing executives said they were surprised at the sales because the revelation of his corporate perks had generated negative publicity , leading mr welch to give up the perks , except for office and administrative support adrian zackheim , publisher of portfolio , the business imprint at penguin group usa , said , people want real solid business advice what does not seem to be working is memoirs that may be because the reputations of so many chief executives have been tainted by everything from bad judgment to criminal behavior that they do not have the mystique they once did , some publishing professionals suggested a handful of corporate yarns also are luring readers , including conspiracy of fools \( broadway books \) by kurt eichenwald , a reporter for the new york times it had the benefit of enormous support from random house , the book publishing unit of bertelsmann stacey creamer , executive editor at doubleday and deputy editorial director at broadway books , two random house imprints , recalled that the chief executive of random house , peter olson , read it and loved it and got behind it and she said that the book sort of defied expectations there had been a lot of enron books that had not done as well , and inhouse there was a concern that the book was too long , she recalled so far the book has had sales of about 120 , 000 copies and was on the new york times bestseller list for five weeks james b stewart s disney war also made the times s bestseller list for four weeks , but it came nowhere near the success of mr stewart s earlier blood sport , which stayed on the list for 16 weeks , or den of thieves , which was on the list twice as long over all , business books still work , but audiences have gotten pickier , said laurence j kirshbaum , the chief executive of the time warner book group , a unit of time warner the group s imprint little brown published both jack straight from the gut by mr welch , which had sales of about 800 , 000 copies and blink , by malcolm gladwell , with about 900 , 000 in sales one factor that makes business tales such a hard sell is that the media now cover them so aggressively in the 1980 s , when ken auletta wrote greed and glory on wall street , the competition for space in people s attention was not as crowded , said peter osnos , founder and publisher at large of publicaffairs , an independent publisher today , by the time a compelling business story is over , it has generally been widely covered in the news media , so much so that books often seem to provide more information than most readers want that may help explain why none of the books that chronicled the time warneraol merger made it to the top of the bestseller lists but in an era where business has gotten even more complicated , business books clearly can add value and readers seem to want any advice that mr welch can give though sales of winning to date are only half the number of mr welch s previous book , the figures so far make it a significant success , according to several other publishers whether or not harpercollins , which paid 4 million for the rights to the welch book , will make money , remains unclear we are expecting the book to continue to sell , said joseph tessitore , president of the collins division of harpercollins , which is owned by the news corporation since each hardcover sale nets the publisher about 10 , after printing and marketing costs , that gives the publisher about 44 million , so far , just enough to cover the advance but even the 440 , 000 figure is somewhat speculative the book has actually sold 321 , 000 copies at cash registers , according to nielsen bookscan , which tracks the industry data that lower figure does not include sales at mass outlets such as walmart and the data also omit sales at universities , where mr welch has been promoting his newest release and the sales figures do not include returns , which can cost a publisher money publishers traditionally print more copies than they sell , so they have to write off at least a portion of those costs advice from chief executives is not the only variety of selfhelp book that has been successful in the business sector in general , really successful business books give you takeaways 'winning' is all about takeaways , said mr tessitore in other cases , it is talking about something that is very current or looking into a trend , he said usefulness comes in several varieties mr osnos said people want a book that explains something that lets us understand our world better than we did before it helps them order their world mr welch s previous book , jack straight from the gut , which came out on sept 11 , 2001 , was a memoir nevertheless , the welch mystique helped propel the book , which mr welch wrote with john a byrne , onto the times s bestseller list , where it remained for six months it benefited not only from mr welch s reputation , but from his willingness to promote the book aggressively on the road winning was classified as an advice book by the new york times , and there are only five slots for bestselling advice books on the times s list winning managed to stay on that list for 11 weeks it is still among the times s business best sellers , where it was no 6 on yesterday s list the book had advantages for one thing , it was published by a company owned by the news corporation , which threw a splashy party for mr welch when the book came out the party garnered a good deal of publicity in part because rupert murdoch , the chairman of the parent company , attended , along with a list of other luminaries we ran an ad in the new york post , said mr tessitore , and mr welch had a great deal of publicity on everything from cbs s 60 minutes to the cover of newsweek it was not particularly pushed at fox , he said so far , winning is in its 11th printing , with 650 , 000 copies out has harpercollins made money from the book \? mr tessitore is coy , leaving open the possibility that the company has yet to make a profit harpercollins has made deals to sell the book in china , japan and elsewhere , however , potentially expanding sales and mr tessitore said he expected the book to sell for years advice from a businessman of jack welch s stature , he said , makes winning a forever book media david carr , whose column normally appears on this page , is on vacation
federal prosecutors have charged a former securities broker , david pajcin , with insider trading related to information the authorities said he gleaned by illegally obtaining advance copies of business week and buying stocks that the magazine was covering favorably according to a federal complaint filed by the united states attorney s office in manhattan and unsealed yesterday , mr pajcin apparently persuaded an unidentified worker at a printing plant near milwaukee to steal a copy of business week before it was released to the public the complaint said that mr pajcin bought shares in at least 10 companies from november 2004 to early march business week wrote positively about all of them mr pajcin bought shares or stock options in companies like thestreetcom , cornell corrections , the sipex corporation , the imax corporation and arbitron early on the same day that the companies appeared in the magazine s inside wall street column a lawyer representing mr pajcin , paul liever , said that his client pleaded not guilty to the insider trading charges at a hearing in manhattan yesterday afternoon mr liever said the court ordered mr pajcin , who is jailed in brooklyn , to post a 500 , 000 bail bond secured with 50 , 000 in cash if mr pajcin posts bail , he will be allowed to return to his home in clifton , nj , where he will be electronicially monitored and subject to a curfew from 8 pm to 8 am mr liever said mr pajcin earned about 90 , 000 over the last year on the trades in question and that none of the trades involved information based on business week articles it s all the result of his skill and his analyzation , mr liever said a business week spokesman , steve weiss , said that the magazine believed the problems involving mr pajcin were isolated and that the periodical goes to great lengths to protect the integrity of its contents this appears to be an isolated incident of criminal activity , mr weiss said , and we 're cooperating with the us attorney in its investigation over the years , business week has been ensnared in other instances of insider trading with circumstances similar to those involving mr pajcin but the complaint against mr pajcin details how closely the magazine seeks to guard business week s content , noting that a limited number of people at the magazine have access to computers used to write and edit the inside wall street column and that the four locations where the magazine is printed operate under strict security this is not the first time mr pajcin has run afoul of lawenforcement authorities in august he was one of nine people the securities and exchange commission accused of making about 6 million from insider trading involving options of reebok international , the athletic shoe manufacturer the sec said that mr pajcin was a leader in that trading , which involved buying call options on reebok stock in august , shortly before the company received a takeover offer that caused its share price to surge some of the trades and profits from that , the sec said , appear to have originated or been transferred to accounts in croatia , germany and austria mr liever said that the sec had frozen an account that mr pajcin s aunt controls , which holds about 25 million related to the reebok trades he said that mr pajcin s aunt lives in croatia

on bitter afternoons , when the city asphalt pounds back like an insult at your feet , a nice place to go is broadway alley , in kips bay on the east side of manhattan it will not take long to explore it broadway alley is a short city byway , a single block in length , which runs narrowly from east 26th street to east 27th street , midway between lexington and third avenues it is 265 feet long , 13 feet wide and one of the last unpaved streets on the macadamized island of manhattan as such , it is one of those forgotten parts of the city with a power to recall to new yorkers that sometimes it really is the earth beneath their feet though it may not look so to the naked eye , the stuff that covers slightly more than half its length is an unfamiliar substance known as dirt about five years ago , residents say , a short piece of the northern stretch of broadway alley was , in fact , paved over to make deliveries easier for a restaurant that had just moved in the rest , however , has stayed untouched since the early days of the 19th century , making it a throwback to manhattan s gaslight past the department of transportation says that broadway alley has remained unpaved for nearly two centuries because it is a private thoroughfare , and thus not subject to the public appetite for asphalt department officials had a harder time determining if broadway alley was the last dirt street in manhattan craig chin , a spokesman , said if it s a private street , it s not maintained by us , which means it could be the only unpaved street , but we would n't know singular or not , the dirt of broadway alley littered with broken glass , spare change , smoked butts and the strawspiked tops of soft drink cups has seen a lot in its roughly 175year life it was laid out sometime around 1830 , presumably by charles lee and adam thomson , who bought its third avenue frontage in 1827 in 1863 the new york times noted in a column called city government that a certain alderman long had moved to shelve a resolution before the committee on lamps and gas to place gas lamps along the alley s length those lamps may have actually been useful considering its dismal look at least according to an unnamed times reporter who wrote about his sojourn there in 1879 on the one hand , the reporter wrote , are stables with ragged stable boys lying in the sun and enjoying more odors at a breath than coleridge found in cologne on the other is a broken and blistered and dingy and halfwindowless row of tenement houses with dusky african faces grinning from every pane it is clear from other published reports that in the early 20th century , broadway alley remained largely poor and largely black it also seems to have had a problem with crime , or at least with criminals , according to times stories from the early 1900 s one of them , which ran dec 29 , 1901 , beneath the headline lawyer caught in a raid , describes the plight of robert lowry , colored , 3 broadway alley , who was arrested on a gambling charge by the men of capt norton goddard s antipolicy society it seems that captain goddard s officers discovered a floating craps game in the basement of 352 third avenue , around the corner from the alley , and picked up , among others , mr lowry , who , according to the article , was taken with such a nervous attack when told that the place was raided that his fingers had to be pried open before the bits of bone could be released none of this history seemed to surprise arshag shegerian , 82 , a former upholsterer , who has lived at no 8 broadway alley in its current incarnation a small back alley with a single occupied building surrounded by the back of a restaurant and vacant , dirty space every now and then we get what you call characters going through , he said , adding with no trace of alarm one time i almost killed one he explained that years ago there had been a close call with a vagrant who had fallen asleep beneath his car but woke to the sound of the ignition and was able to scurry away mr arshag s building has entrances on both the alley and third avenue and , three years ago , he formally changed to an avenue address apparently to please the postman he recalled hearing that way , way back the alley s builders had given it the broadway name to give it an impressive theatrical aura the finest thing about it these days , he said , is the parking , which is free william morrison , of william morrison communications , who lives and works at no 8 broadway alley , said the short street , true to its history , once had a problem with drunkards and prostitutes alleys sometimes attract people you would n't want there , mr morrison said , adding that the problems were mainly solved 10 years or so ago with the installation of a chainlink fence the fence , which is locked each night , impedes nocturnal trespassers , though by day one is free to explore the alley s charms these include its dingy , almost stablelike atmosphere , the castiron type g wall lamps mounted at either end and the rare ability in new york city to dig one s toes in the dirt without being near a construction site or park then there is the fact that the barnum bailey circus once kept its elephants in the alley , which might account for the earthy smell it certainly left mohammad nasrood wondering a livery driver , mr nasrood parked his black sedan in broadway alley the other day dirt \? mr nasrood asked when told of the substance underneath his tires he had a quizzical look there is that in new york \?
kpmg , the accounting firm , was censured yesterday by the securities and exchange commission , which said the firm helped executives at the xerox corporation manipulate and distort financial

said that accounting fraud began at xerox in 1997 , and allowed the company to overstate its financial results by 15 billion over four years xerox shares lost 80 percent of their value after the fraud was disclosed in 2000 this is a case about gatekeepers and the failure to do the job that the investing public expects auditors to do , said paul r berger , an associate director of enforcement at the commission he said the sec was continuing litigation against five kpmg partners involved in the audits george ledwith , kpmg s spokesman , said in a statement the settlement , which represents events from an earlier period in some cases as much as eight years ago does not involve findings that kpmg s conduct was fraudulent or reckless our success as a professional services firm is inextricably linked to our performance , our reputation and our commitment to leadership and integrity this settlement is reflective of the firm s efforts to work with our regulators in a cooperative way in order to help strengthen public confidence in the capital markets kpmg was xerox s auditor for 40 years , regulators said the enduring relationship contributed to a lax approach to xerox s bookkeeping , they said , as well as a willingness on the part of the firm to remove from the xerox assignment a partner who had raised concerns about the company s accounting to its management the partner was reassigned after xerox complained to kpmg s chairman about the partner s actions in 1999 the sec found that kpmg allowed xerox to manipulate its accounting practices to close a 3 billion gap between its actual results and those it reported publicly from 1997 through 2000 xerox increased its equipment revenues and earnings through the use of special reserves and other methods that violated generally accepted accounting principles , the commission said during that period , kpmg issued audit reports stating that xerox s accounting was consistent with accounting rules and that its books were a fair representation of the company s financial condition but , regulators said , the firm let xerox use accounting techniques that did not comply with established rules and that allowed the company to falsify its results kpmg was intimately familiar with the accounting used by xerox , the sec said the firm s audit partners were warned many times by other kpmg employees in offices around the world that xerox s accounting was not based on reality but kpmg ignored these warnings and failed to ask for evidence from xerox to support its accounting practices the sec also said that kpmg violated its duty to advise xerox when it discovered illegal acts in its audits and even though kpmg at times suggested that xerox test its accounting assumptions and adjustments for accuracy , kpmg never pressed the company to do so among the changes kpmg agreed to were a review and documentation of circumstances surrounding any reassignment or replacement of an engagement partner from an audit an examination of an audit client s justification for any accounting practices that do not adhere to the industry s rules and the creation of a method for whistleblowers to express anonymously their concerns about audit practices two years after kpmg s chairman certifies that these changes have been put in place , the firm must hire a consultant to examine its compliance with the changes the consultant may also recommend other improvements kpmg should make to its practices kpmg said its agreement to make the changes was consistent with the firm s commitment to continuously improving audit quality mr berger of the sec said that the changes were uncommon in their specificity it is a bit unusual to require a number of undertakings like this , he said the 225 million that kpmg agreed to pay in yesterday s settlement will be deposited in a restitution fund for distribution to investors who lost money in xerox stock when the fraud was disclosed that fund already holds 22 million paid by six senior executives at xerox in 2003 when they settled the sec s allegations of accounting fraud as is customary , none of those executives admitted or denied wrongdoing in the matter the five kpmg partners on the xerox audit that remain subject to the sec s civil suit are michael a conway , a senior official at the firm anthony p dolanski , who was the lead partner on the xerox account from 1995 to 1997 ronald a safran , who was head of the company s audits in 1998 and 1999 joseph t boyle , who was involved in the audits in 1999 and 2000 and thomas yoho , a concurring review partner on the xerox audits only mr safran and mr yoho remain at kpmg mr dolanski left in 1998 and mr boyle and mr conway have retired frank wohl , a lawyer at lankler , siffert wohl who represents mr yoho , said yesterday that his client believes that he properly fulfilled all of his professional responsibilities on the audits none of the other lawyers representing kpmg employees returned phone calls seeking comment
when aroostook county crowned its first potato blossom queen , in 1937 , the county seat , houlton , was one of the 10 richest towns in new england the county s famed potatoes had been nourishing the nation for 130 years but that was before the great plains of idaho had become virtual french fry factories , and before irrigation , pesticides and fertilizers made it possible to grow potatoes even in the warm , sandy soil of florida now , said jim gerritsen , a farmer in bridgewater , me , our biggest export is our children potatoes are second aroostook is the largest county east of the mississippi river according to the 2000 census , it is one of the emptiest , with only 11 people per square mile but a high proportion of those people are farmers who are convinced of the superiority of the maine potato , and are fiercely dedicated to preserving it , along with their small family farms now we just have to convince the rest of the world , one mouth at a time , mr gerritsen said this month , hugo s , one of several restaurants that have transformed portland into a cradle of artisanal bread and woodroasted apple tarts , did its part with its fifth annual potato dinner forty guests paid 120 each for a ninecourse ballet that included mainegrown potatoes in every course the potatoes were boiled , whipped , crumbcoated , poached in butter , shaved and even coated in chocolate the meal began with the chefowner rob evans s signature insideout french fry , a tiny tube of potato filled with a line of heinz ketchup , then sealed , coated with finely ground panko and deepfried \( mr evans s innovative dishes often incorporate familiar flavors his succulent potato consomm \? s garnished with a cap of gelled sour cream and a drizzle of hot bacon fat \) but the preparations began six hours earlier when nancy pugh , the restaurant s coowner , started drilling holes in the huge russet potatoes that would hold a deep pink bouquet on every table theme dinners in restaurants are hardly unusual , but the featured ingredient is often something elusive , like wild game , wild mushrooms or the first asparagus of spring , and seldom something so pedestrian as a potato but these are not ordinary potatoes , said mr evans , who grew up near boston and cooked at the french laundry and the inn at little washington before settling in portland in 2000 i 've never worked with so many different kinds before , so many textures , he said the carola has this creamy flavor , the butte is light and silky i never thought maine produce could compete with california , and the ingredients are not as opulent , but all you have to do is pay attention to distinguish their potatoes , these farmers have embraced a raft of ideological labels organic , local , sustainable , heirloom , slow , artisanal , gourmet and farmtotable instead of growing an industrial potato suitable for longterm storage , transport or freezing , they say they grow a culinary potato there are literally hundreds of potato breeds to choose from , said jim cook of skylandia farm , at the northern tip of the state we grow the 50 that do best on the plate this results in potatoes that truly taste better , with subtle distinctions of flavor and texture , and that command high prices at local produce markets a lot of buyers told them it would never work with a cheap staple like potatoes , said bonnie clariot , produce manager for the whole grocer in portland , which last week sold out of wood prairie farm s elba and rose gold potatoes at 439 for a threepound bag but our customers really go out of their way to support maine agriculture , and once they start paying attention to how the potatoes taste , they never go back , she said potatoes are like apples think of the difference between macs and golden delicious , said mr cook , who contributed to the potato dinner this year , then ate with the crowd farmers are always invited to the dinner , mr evans said it directly connects the people spooning up a delicious risotto made from mainegathered wild matsutake mushrooms , garlic and finely diced butte potatoes with the people whose livelihood depends on their luxuries after a course that included tiny crispfried pierogi of foie gras wrapped in potato dough , the farmers got up , spoke about their work , and thanked the customers for coming it is an elegant bit of marketing genius , making diners feel great about spending so much money on dinner but when the potato farmers started talking shop , the gloves came off have you seen the summer issue of potato grower magazine \? mr gerritsen said a current spud scandal many of the socalled yukon golds in markets are inferior copies from canada , the farmers said a true yukon gold will have a pinkish cast to its eyes and skin , and it s more round , not oblong or flat , mr cook said people always say that yukon golds taste buttery , but they actually taste like potatoes , he added it s just that people have become used to tasteless potatoes , and 'buttery' is a compliment
paris , march 23 according to the french satirical weekly le canard encha n , president jacques chirac is listening in on his archrival nicolas sarkozy s phone calls the newspaper reported wednesday that mr sarkozy , who quit as finance minister under mr chirac last year to lead mr chirac s own party , the union for a popular movement , is aware of the surveillance and has told friends that he believes the people responsible are mr chirac and his prot g dominique de villepin , who took over mr sarkozy s earlier post as interior minister the article , written in the winkandnod style of the 90yearold newspaper , gave no attribution for the charge but many such tidbits in the paper have proven accurate in the past most recently , the newspaper disclosed that mr sarkozy s successor at the finance ministry , herv gaymard , had rented an extremely expensive apartment at government expense the subsequent scandal led to his resignation the wiretapping allegations were met by a wall of silence in the capital the presidential palace declined to comment , as did mr sarkozy s office mr sarkozy has made no secret of his desire to run for mr chirac s job in the presidential elections of 2007 mr chirac has yet to say whether he will run for reelection , but if he does not , he is expected to back someone other than mr sarkozy the newspaper article , which appears to have originated with someone in mr sarkozy s camp , said that he was aware of the surveillance and wily enough not to be caught saying anything useful to his political rivals listening in on people s phone conversations would not be new for a french president fran ois mitterrand ran an extensive surveillance system out of lys e palace , taping the calls of dozens of politicians in part to ensure that none of them revealed the fact that he had a mistress , and a daughter whom he was housing at state expense a trial of several people implicated by the scandal concluded in february and a verdict is expected in april
fathers and daughters by benjamin markovits 283 pages w w norton company 2395 the relation of a father and a daughter is an intended thematic link for these four stories billed as a novel by benjamin markovits that each partly takes place at an unnamed private school in the northern bronx links them by setting what is more important than connection , which at times seems schematic , is progression it is as if the young writer were laying out before us an artistic journey that begins in cleverness alluring in spots but elsewhere bumpy and raw and ends in stirring mastery even with the weaker material , mr markovits sometimes manages a narrative intensity that holds without necessarily persuading his sense of new york and its people is as newminted as each year s seasons the frozen winter blocks , the commingled yellow of early daffodils and cabs clustering on park avenue , the wrinkling heat of summer days stretched on loose elastic that had lost its snap and his new yorkers a

bostick has come east from indiana to teach high school biology for a while she spends evenings and weekends weeping in her dingy apartment a selfdescribed daddy s girl , she badly misses her father , jack , athletic and attractive he had been , that is when the family comes to visit she sees decline the roll of fat above jack s belt seems to signal a sense of failure and the shrunken aspect of country mice in the city by contrast there is her lover , charles rich , knowledgeable , highspirited what plays out between him and jack is more or less a matter of young bull displacing \( politely \) old bull or , since both men are essentially hollowed out , young steer and old ox the story is contrived , if sometimes agreeably second chance is smarter and better developed its protagonist , howard peasbody , is a colleague of amy s gay and sour he lives with a younger man whom he manages to dominate domination is his controlling need not in order to touch others so much as to make sure that nobody touches him his defenses threaten to be breached when annie , a former woman friend \( she of the retired shawls \) lets him know that his drunken onenight heterosexual venture , years before , had produced a daughter they all meet at first he wonders if he has been given a second chance to dispel his solitude \( his male lover is little more than a domestic pet \) before long , even this toedeep emotional exposure is too much , and howard withdraws , nastily the characters are drawn with some complexity annie and her teenage daughter , frannie gritty big applecores the pair of them come to tart life the author , though , is stirring the coals of a dead fire as he explores at weary length the emotional nuances of the misanthropic howard in fiction , to know all is not to pardon all and certainly not the author there is very little to pardon and a great deal to be grateful for in the last two stories a girl as fresh as spring and inheritance are linked particularly closely a major element of each is the relationship of stuart englander , a middleaged english teacher , and rachel kranz , a 17yearold student englander , protagonist of the first story , is stout , pink and kindly , but the passionate discrimination and originality with which he teaches literature regularly win him an avid following among the school s brightest students his classroom verve contrasts with his aging depression his marriage is solid , but so is a tombstone he gets postcards from a former colleague who eloped , shamefully but happily , with a student he begins to notice rachel , who sits demure and silent while following him with a blue gaze and when unexpectedly she turns in a brilliant paper , he feels the revivifying flush of a teacher s true power to bestow recognition , to raise up it can also be the teacher s deepest temptation , and so it proves rachel s work drops off puzzlingly , she comes to his office in tears , he hugs her , senses a response and then , at her ambiguous mr englander , please , retreats to safety and perhaps regret nothing more , though the author treats it not as tragedy but as autumn s dwindling pastoral what has happened , in a large sense , is growing old in near collision with growing up and here mr markovits embarks on his triumphantly climactic story of rachel , one where the scene that bulked so large to her teacher is a small side trip for her more essential things are happening to her her father , reuben , is a rich , scrupulously contained lawyer her mother , tasha , a mercurial free spirit while reuben earns , and gives , tasha receives and spends she is too much for him , and they separate she has plenty of weather , your mother , he tells rachel he , seemingly , has none rachel s quiet , her guardedness , her selfprotective neatness , is her inheritance from him from her mother she appears to have inherited nothing then reuben begins to die of brain cancer rachel moves in to care for him and in doing so how splendidly the author populates his characters she finds how much of tasha she harbors one night she hears a stormy fight between her father and mother , who has moved back as well it is over a piece of cake it is followed by the bedroom door closing , and quiet and a flash of awareness she was the child of love it will send her into adulthood in many ways , rachel is ordinary but then so was madame bovary mr markovits s writing makes the ordinary unforgettable
greenburgh , ny , march 14 doubt malik rose s sanity , if you must others certainly have many more undoubtedly will by the end of this week , after the heightdeficient rose has gone headtoribs with shaquille o'neal , and at his request as an undersized big man an oxymoron , if ever there was one it is what you do to make it in the nba so several years ago , as a young fringe player with the san antonio spurs , rose approached his coach , gregg popovich , and volunteered for shaq duty that moment of inspiration \( or pure foolishness \) turned into a sixyear vocation rose became the spurs' designated o'neal defender off the bench every time the spurs and los angeles lakers met , including five playoff series between 1999 and 2004 when i first guarded shaq , it was when i was trying to keep a job , recalled rose , who was obtained by the knicks last month so i just ran out there and tried to do whatever the knicks can only hope that the modest success rose enjoyed will give them an edge against o'neal and his new team , the miami heat the knicks and the heat play tuesday night at madison square garden and again saturday in south florida it is a critical stretch for the knicks \( 2635 \) , whose playoff hopes hinge on every game if o'neal runs wild through the knicks' interior this week , he might trample their postseason dreams so coach herb williams s strategy against o'neal is simple we 're going to use everybody we have , he said mike sweetney , the knicks' stout young center , will guard o'neal to start the game , allowing kurt thomas to avoid early foul trouble after sweetney , the knicks will send a chorus line of relative runts at o'neal , who is 7 feet 1 inch and 330 pounds having traded 610 nazr mohammed for rose , the knicks have a rotation littered with big men measuring 67 to 69 , none heavier than 270 pounds \( sweetney \) williams promises to send doubleteam help , as the knicks did in a 116110 overtime loss to miami on feb 9 they held o'neal to 16 points , only to get buried by guard dwyane wade , who scored 10 of his 30 points in overtime but any hope of beating miami begins and ends with defending o'neal , and the knicks now have a new option in san antonio , rose had an unofficial nickname generously listed he is probably 65 , but as countless articles noted , he was generously listed at 67 in his official biography when rose s turn against o'neal comes , he will embrace it with a peculiar enthusiasm hell , yeah , rose said , smiling twice in a week rose is looking for redemption he played perhaps his worst game as a knick in sunday s loss to seattle , committing a late offensive foul and missing a critical free throw every time i used to play against shaq , win or lose , i looked at it as i'm going up against the most dominant post player in the game , rose said if i make him miss a shot or i get a rebound on him , i feel that much better so it kind of boosts my confidence , and i could use a little bit of that right now only a handful of players rose s height have had success against o'neal danny fortson , rotund and powerful , has sometimes flustered o'neal with his aggression charles barkley , perhaps the greatest 66 power player in nba history , used strength and a low center of gravity rose has the low center of gravity , but a modest supply of muscle yet he gained a loyal following in san antonio for his hustle and smart play , and his willingness to sacrifice his wellbeing i used to always call him the most versatile defender in spurs history , seattle s antonio daniels , rose s former spurs teammate , said one day he would guard shaq , and the next day we would play in orlando and he would guard tracy mcgrady but it was o'neal who made rose a hero to spurs fans daniels said rose succeeded by using his quickness and his shrewdness , bumping o'neal from behind on one possession , playing off him on the next it was like he was always feeling for malik and could never find him , daniels said whenever possible , rose simply pinned himself to o'neal i'm like a book bag on him , rose said i hang on his back all night long his low moment against o'neal came in the 2001 western conference finals , a fourgamestonone lakers sweep i would do all my little tricks on him and he was n't having it , rose said i was helpless he would n't let me get any offensive rebounds , he would n't let me push him out that was a nightmare the only one unimpressed with rose s sturdy defense on shaq is shaq he does what everybody else does , o'neal said grab and foul and hope that the ref does n't call it
the edwardians by roy hattersley \( st martin s , 35 \) the edwardian period has long been dismissed as a mere interlude between the victorian era and world war i hattersley , a former deputy leader of the labor party and cabinet minister , will have none of this displaying an a j p taylorlike zest for turning orthodoxy on its head , hattersley argues that the edwardians blazed the path to modernity he traces the emergence of the labor party and the consequences of david lloyd george s famous 1909 people s budget , which levied punitive taxes on the aristocracy his forays into social

demolished the traditional notion of phlogiston an imaginary element supposedly present in combustible objects by identifying oxygen by 1793 , however , lavoisier fell victim to the calumnies circulated by his envious scientific rival , jeanpaul marat , who was also a jacobin pamphleteer as an aristocrat and partner in the reviled general farm , which collected taxes on behalf of the bourbon monarchy , lavoisier was an easy target exhibiting a bit of impatience with lavoisier s imperturbable faith in scientific order and equilibrium , bell suggests that his guillotining may go

mechanical tricks dated back to his childhood , when , among other things , he invented a collapsing outhouse he captures keaton s antic , madcap energy , in which the human body the permutations of the sinews , the shock of the limbs seems infinitely elastic , an unruly instrument to be wielded with a cheeky kind of grace an improvident first marriage and a collapse into alcoholism damaged , but

muddled work than this one hedges , a former reporter for the new york times , seeks to offer a liberal s moral indictment of the united states , but his fevered condemnations are no more persuasive than those shrilly emanating from the right the stories of hardship he has collected seem dated , and his disquisitions about the evils of imperialism and poverty are never convincingly tied to the ten commandments , which he does not really bother to discuss at most hedges engages in anguished lucubrations about his days at harvard divinity school , and his experiences as a war correspondent in central america , which have apparently prompted him to despair of america not untypical are emotional outbursts about the perils posed by consumer goods and the quest for success we believe we need

britain s elites for the breakdown in social comity may not be as obvious as dalrymple would have it , but he astutely shows how the semantic blurring of terms like depression and unhappiness has withered notions of personal responsibility dalrymple s prose style is selfconsciously arch at times , and he goes off the rails in ascribing the vulgarization of british culture to the lifting of

seoul , south korea , thursday , dec 29 hwang woo suk , south korea s disgraced star scientist , could present no evidence to corroborate his landmark claim that he had cloned human embryos and extracted from them stem cells that genetically match patients , a university panel said thursday the announcement by the panel , from seoul national university where dr hwang did his research , suggested that he did not just grossly exaggerate his work in an article published in the journal science in june , but fabricated the entire paper so far we could not find any stem cells regarding dr hwang s 2005 paper that genetically match the dna of patients , said roe jung hye , the university s dean of research affairs , in a statement according to our judgment , dr hwang s team does n't have scientific data to prove that it has produced such stem cells there was no immediate comment from dr hwang , who apologized last week for falsifications in his paper and resigned from the university the latest revelation added more skepticism to his persistent claim that he at least had the technology to clone human embryos and extract stem cells from them , which would be a breakthrough in the quest to help patients with hardtotreat diseases to produce their own , regenerated tissues if his claim proves false , the goal of such treatment , known as therapeutic cloning , may be considerably further off than it seemed a few months ago , when dr hwang s fame was at a peak hopes for therapeutic cloning soared after he published a stunning paper in science in february 2004 , claiming to be the first to clone a human embryo by transferring an adult cell s nucleus into an egg , and extracting a stem cell line from it he further solidified his fame with his june paper , in which he claimed to have not only repeated the process with 11 patients but also did so with a far fewer number of human eggs but the university committee that has been investigating allegations of fabrications said last friday that he had falsified data for 9 of the 11 patientderived embryonic stem cell lines in his june paper of the remaining two lines , the panel had said it did not yet know whether they had been derived from patients or from fertilized human eggs in a followup report thursday , the committee , citing extensive dna tests , said that none of the stem cells dr hwang said he had created for his june paper was produced through cloning all the samples presented for the paper that still exist in his laboratory were stem cells extracted from fertilized human eggs at seoul s mizmedi hospital , which participated in dr hwang s research , dr roe said we have asked three independent labs to conduct dna tests on the samples , and all three came out with the same conclusion , she said none of the stem cells were patientspecific they were all fertilizedegg stem cells from mizmedi apparently anticipating such an outcome , dr hwang had claimed that his authentic stem cells were stolen from his lab and were replaced with mizmedi samples mizmedi scientists accused dr hwang of a coverup the panel is still investigating his 2004 study , and the authenticity of an afghan hound snuppy , which was unveiled by dr hwang in august as the world s first cloned dog verifying the 2004 paper holds the key to the question of whether the fallen south korean researcher had ever cloned a human embryo dr roe said the panel would announce its final findings in midjanuary
philadelphia harriet miers has said that , if confirmed to the supreme court , she intends to strictly apply the law and the constitution president bush says his nominee will not legislate from the bench a new survey in the american bar association journal found that a majority of americans are upset with judicial activism those respondents , like the president and ms miers , appear to accept the view of chief justice john roberts that judges are like umpires umpires do n't make the rules they apply them in fact , judges must routinely interpret the law just as umpires must interpret the rules of the game this is not a sign of activism , but an inherent part of either job what differentiates individuals is how they approach this task of interpretation three decades ago i was behind the plate in a semipro game in which robin roberts , a hall of fame pitcher , was coaching early in the game , roberts asked me why i was n't calling strikes when his pitchers threw just below the batter s knees he used to get those calls from national league umpires i replied that on this i was a strict constructionist since \( at the time \) the rule book defined the strike zone as beginning at the top of the knees , that s what i called later in the same game , the other team s manager , who was also acting as a base coach , stopped between innings at the mound he picked up the ball , handed it to his pitcher , gave him a word of encouragement , and continued to the dugout roberts came out and asked whether i was going to count that exchange as a trip to the mound \( managers are permitted only two such trips to the same pitcher per inning \) i decided that this was n't a time for strict construction surely the rule makers did n't intend to count that kind of interaction as a trip again , roberts nodded at my explanation , and the game continued as a former bigleaguer , roberts understood that the rules of baseball , like most laws , can be interpreted in different ways even though the rule book is clear in its definition of a strike , some umpires presume a pitch to be a strike unless there is a reason to call it a ball others presume the pitch to be a ball unless they deem it to be a strike and some appear to have no regular approach at all to making ballstrike decisions the first group are considered pitchers' umpires the second are praised by batters the third group is often criticized for not having a strike zone , because they , like , say , justice sandra day o'connor , appear to take a casebycase approach to their adjudications nevertheless , they have a methodology what coaches and players want to know is what kind of umpire they have behind the plate that day umpires often have no choice but to use discretion they cannot invoke the infield fly rule unless an infielder can catch the ball with ordinary effort and they must call a balk on a pitcher trying to pick off a runner on first if he does not step directly towards the base umpires spend years learning how to interpret common legislative terms like ordinary and directly so within a certain range , umpires have leeway but baseball does n't tolerate an umpire whose judgment is on the fringe indeed , the umpire who is overly technical in calling balks , or who sees balks when none occur , is too far outside the mainstream to last earlier this year , the supreme court had to decide whether the juvenile death penalty was cruel and unusual punishment the majority and dissents used different methods to decide what those words mean both had to justify their methods of interpretation neither could rely solely on the text of the eighth amendment this nuance , however , seems to be lost on many politicians what our legal system demands , said senator jeff sessions of alabama , is a fair and unbiased umpire , one who calls the game according to the existing rules well , yes , but the best umpires are honest enough to acknowledge that they have an approach to umpiring the myth of the neutral umpire is no more tenable than that of the neutral justice when the senate considers harriet miers , the philosophy behind her decisionmaking is what matters , especially since she does n't have a minorleague record oped contributor robert schwartz , a lawyer and executive director of the juvenile law center , is a former umpire

dog to play to any audience other than himself it s always good to see a writer please himself , but littell s focus on his higher purposes leaves , in its wake , far too much sloppiness , repetition , even overwriting his attention seems to wander for long stretches , as if he does n't care about the narrative s fictional scaffolding and is saving his talents for the denouement he expends , for example , little energy on furnishing his improbable hero with lifelike contours martin odum , a retired cia agent living in brooklyn and working as a private eye , has served in an unlikely variety of operations from the khyber pass to the bekaa in lebanon with endless resources and expertise in tradecraft , he s also served in south america where he first made contact with bin laden and discovered the existence of al qaeda now , on an afternoon in 1997 , martin is drawn back into the game when he is visited by an attractive woman who wants him to locate her missing brotherinlaw , a noir set piece with a twist the brotherinlaw has disappeared from an orthodox community in israel , and the reason he must be found is to oblige him to grant a get \( a religious divorce \) to his abandoned wife so she may marry again martin exists , in other words , in a kind of fantasy thriller a caricature not only of the actual nutsandbolts work of the national security apparatus but of the novelistic representation of that reality , with all its rules of authenticity and believability even a czech interrogator , subjecting martin to torture at one point , finds his credulity stretched by the simple truth of the novel s plot i am familiar with the school of intelligence activities that holds that a good cover story must be made to seem preposterous if it is to be believed but you are pushing this thesis to its limits which seems to be littell s object , revealed by a number of absurdist details his excia boss is named crystal quest but known as fred martin himself is so completely lost in the various legends , or false identities of his operational career , that he no longer knows which is real and which is a product of the legend committee at langley \( the cia , we 're told , once gave a therapist security clearance to help martin remember who he really was \) so martin sets out on an odyssey through a largely jewish world , from crown heights to israel to prague , a quest in which his cia past collides with postsoviet gangsters and the growing islamist threat along the way he discovers a huge bioterrorism operation , and gets involved in a plot to repatriate the bones of a lithuanian saint and another to recover torah scrolls lost during the holocaust bodies fall regularly , and the quarry , the errant brotherinlaw , grows steadily more ambiguous until it is no longer clear who is chasing whom and why most important , a series of flashbacks allows the traumatic secret behind martin s multiple personality disorder to bubble , slowly , frighteningly , to the surface if all this sounds like you 've heard it before , you have there s not much in this odd book that is n't done elsewhere , often by littell himself the serpentine explications of the cia the depictions of postsoviet gangsterism and the detailed recounting of tradecraft but littell seems unconcerned with originality or even verisimilitude his interest , rather , is in the deeply human motivation behind martin s dogged journey martin is conducting an investigation , sure , and that investigation will yield surprising results , both about its object and about our country his true journey , though , is an interior one as always , remembering a detail from dante s past that is , the past of one of his own false identities reminded martin that he , too , must have had a past , and this gave him a measure of hope that he could one day retrieve it it is in this dimension of legends that littell travels enticingly close to territory largely unexplored in political fiction the symmetry between the macroscopic movements of governments and the microscopic weapons with which the human psyche confronts reality after all , essentially the same plausible deniability that president reagan used to navigate the irancontra scandal is the star player in freud s arsenal of neurotic defense mechanisms littell s investigation of his own dissembling hero helps unite some of the disjointed qualities of this ambitious , curious novel neil gordon is literary editor of boston review , chairman of the writing program at eugene lang college of new school university , and the author , most recently , of the company you keep , a novel
mumbai in july , the director vishal bharadwaj whose latest film , the blue umbrella , is a lyrical meditation on how man s acquisitiveness disrupts harmony pitched a project to a bollywood producer best known for bgrade hindi movies , in which comedy and cleavage can be more important than the plot or the characters mr bharadwaj s proposal was complicated a sophisticated thriller with voiceovers , flashforwards , and some scenes that would begin at the end and work backwards but the producer mulled the idea over for a few minutes and declared that it was hatke hindi for different and that he would bankroll it five years ago , i could n't find one producer , mr bharadwaj said , and now i have to choose among 10 willing to finance anything i want to make i am blessed to be working in these changing times traditionally , there were two schools of hindi cinema the center stage was occupied by bollywood , which enthralled indians globally with songanddance extravaganzas and melodramatic stories big on family values the other was the satyajit rayinspired realistic arthouse films , which flowered in the 1970 s and 80 s like the auteurs of the french new wave , these art filmmakers tried to create a distinct language of film , but their work was relegated to festivals and television , where it wilted in the wings lately , a third type of hindi cinema has emerged it s composed of smaller , offbeat films that are more realistic than bollywood tales and edgier than arthouse ones the films have an urbane , uniquely indian sensibility many , though not all , are in hinglish , the hybrid of hindi and english that is spoken in metropolitan india these films have none of the overt glamour or sunny disposition of mainstream movies emotions are messy , characters have pasts and endings are n't always happy but neither are the movies treatises on social issues far removed from the filmmakers' own experience , like so much arthouse cinema was working with low budgets 450 , 000 to 115 million , as opposed to more than 25 million for a bollywood film they are defying conventions and labels as the director homi adajania , whose first film , being cyrus , is being released in december , put it after all , india is not just bollywood and a punjabi wedding mr adajania s india is most certainly not being cyrus is a dark , unsettling film about the members of a dysfunctional parsi family who let a stranger into their lives , with dire consequences mr adajania , whose characters speak in english with a smattering of gujarati , said he was interested in the stark underbelly of life the film s only crowdpleasing aspect is the lead , saif ali khan , an alist bollywood star who usually plays charming heroes grimness is no longer box office poison , however the first hit of 2005 was page 3 , the director madhur bhandarkar s scathing look at high society in mumbai it featured pedophilia , drugfueled rave parties and unabashed nastiness the film , made for 575 , 000 , grossed 23 million in india a stellar performance , even though it did n't have what bollywood insiders call face value \( like stars or hit songs \) iqbal , another lowbudget film , also emerged a winner the story of a deafmute village boy who yearns to be an international cricket player , it opened to euphoric reviews and recouped its 685 , 000 budget in five weeks seven years ago , iqbal s director , nagesh kukunoor , kickstarted hinglish cinema with hyderabad blues , which was released in one theater in mumbai and went on to become a hit but the current crop of indian independents can count on far wider release , thanks in large part to the arrival of more multiplexes the first indian multiplex , the pvr anupam , opened in new delhi in june 1997 until then most filmgoers patronized cavernous theaters with 1 , 000 to 1 , 500 seats crippled by steep entertainment taxes , enormous operating costs and dwindling audiences , many of these movie houses were in an advanced state of ruin , even in the largest cities , like mumbai and new delhi after the pvr anupam opened , some state governments announced entertainment tax exemptions and prompted a multiplex boom there are 73 multiplexes in india , with 276 screens and about 89 , 470 seats the numbers are expected to increase to 135 multiplexes with more than 160 , 000 seats by the end of 2006 significantly , multiplex viewers are more upscale than the general audience multiplex ticket prices average 225 , compared with 115 for the singlescreen theaters , and the most expensive seats at multiplexes can cost as much as 4 according to a may 2005 report by yes bank and the film and television producers guild of india , multiplexes constitute only 06 percent of about 12 , 000 cinema halls in india , but they account for 28 percent to 34 percent of the box office take for the top 50 films in 2004 the more affluent multiplex viewers have given filmmakers new fiscal and artistic freedom a film is a conversation , said the directorproducer ram gopal varma , head of a production house , the factory , which turns out about six films a year the multiplex gives me flexibility and enables me to have a conversation with my intended target audience without worrying about small towns and villages that is perhaps why even major stars are now willing to do the occasional offbeat film mr bhandarkar s next production is corporate , centered on relationships and rivalries in the indian business world , and on a dusky , statuesque star , bipasha basu , who is mostly famous for her sex appeal she said she hoped that mr bhandarkar would help change her image i want to do a realistic film , she said , to create a balance in me as an actor this film will not present a fantasy bipasha basu so far , mr bhandarkar is the only filmmaker who has created a genuine offbeat blockbuster but his peers say they are glad , finally , to be part of a flourishing independent film culture in films , you have to follow your heart , mr bharadwaj said multiplexes have made it easier for me to do that
to the sports editor re laidback angel fans lose a bit of cool \( oct 15 \) the root of the problem that might have cost the angels game 2 of the alcs was not the mechanics or judgment of the umpire or the inexperience of the thirdstring catcher the problem is a rule that 1 \) fails to respect the real skills of professional catchers , like josh paul 2 \) is inherently difficult for umpires to judge or even see with reasonable accuracy 3 \) often leaves players in an ambiguous situation to run or not , to tag or not and 4 \) confuses at least the casual fan does it not make sense to change this rule and call the batter out on a third strike when the ball ends up firmly and securely \( umpire jargon \) in the catcher s glove whether or not it hits the dirt first \? this would put the play on a par with a forceout at first base , in which the fielder has to catch the ball firmly and securely whether it hits the dirt or not is irrelevant rules , as much as possible , should make the game uncomplicated for umpires to call , for players to play and for fans to watch , and they should reward skill the thirdstrike rule does none of these things daniel hood new york the writer has been a high school and sandlot umpire in michigan , pennsylvania and new york for 40 years
syracuse , march 25 from a hillock on the shore of onondaga lake , brad powless , the newest chief of the onondaga nation , traced the outlines of his community s struggles , both ancient and modern hundreds of years ago , he said , pointing across the water , a peace delegation representing several indian tribes crossed from the east side of the lake to persuade the fierce leader of the onondagas to join a federation of indian nations from that meeting evolved the iroquois confederacy , or the haudenosaunee , as its members prefer this ancestral connection to the lake , which is considered one of the most polluted bodies of water in the country , underpins the onondagas' latest battle , said mr powless , 37 on march 11 , the community filed a federal lawsuit claiming ownership of a 3 , 100squaremile swath of new york state , stretching from lake ontario and the st lawrence seaway to the pennsylvania border the onondagas contend that the state of new york illegally acquired the land in a series of treaties in the late 18th and early 19th centuries and have asked the federal district court in syracuse to declare that they still hold title to the land the lawsuit is the largest indian land claim ever filed in new york their legal action has put a light on a small community that has largely avoided the kind of public attention that the other members of the haudenosaunee have drawn the onondaga nation has about 1 , 500 members , and its federally recognized territory is an 11squaremile parcel in a valley south of syracuse and about eight miles from the southern end of onondaga lake the community maintains its own customs , language and laws and is governed by a council of chiefs , which meets in a traditional longhouse , a large , open room that serves as the spiritual and political center of the community the territory has four churches , a healing center , a cigarette store , an arena for ice hockey and indoor lacrosse , and one school some of the nation s adults work full time in their territory while others work outside , in private firms or government offices the nation s leaders have said that they do not intend to forcibly take away anyone s land in the disputed territory , which is now home to hundreds of thousands of people they also said that unlike other indian tribes that are pursuing land claims against the state , they are not interested in compensation involving money and casinos what they want is influence in major policy discussions affecting the ecosystem in their ancestral lands they also hope to use a favorable judgment to buy land to increase agricultural and housing opportunities , protect ancestors' gravesites and safeguard the environment we came to this point without avarice or any kind of greedy expectation , audrey shenandoah , 78 , one of the community s clan mothers , said in an interview in the onondaga nation territory the onondagas' dream of an expanded taxexempt territory may have been dealt a significant setback by a united states supreme court decision on tuesday involving the oneida indian nation and its property tax dispute with sherrill , a small upstate new york city the court ruled that the oneidas could not buy ancestral land that had been out of their possession for generations and convert it to a taxfree holding joseph j heath , the lawyer for the onondaga nation , said the onondagas were reeling from the decision there may not be a legal solution to this , he said but he said the onondagas would forge ahead with their own claim to determine whether there had been historic violations of federal law and to gain that say in the environmental issues the emotional and environmental focus of their legal action , onondaga officials say , is onondaga lake and its watershed , which is now hemmed in by urban development for decades , the lake , which is in northwest syracuse and is about a mile wide and 4 1 2 miles long , was used as a dumping ground for industrial refuse in 1994 it was added to the federal superfund list of toxic waste sites several other superfund sites are around the lake this is why we 're so upset , mr powless said this is our home , this is where our history is , and it was treated as a trash dump the hillock on which mr powless spoke was formed by tons of industrial waste that came from a local factory , according to mr heath you ca n't use the lake , you ca n't fish , you ca n't swim in the water , you ca n't collect medicines , said sid hill , 53 , another of the onondagas' 14 chiefs and the community s spiritual leader the onondaga elders tell stories about how trout used to fill their territory s creeks and run north through the lake and the oswego river to lake ontario now the onondagas generally avoid eating fish from their area , fearing contamination mr hill said the state s announcement in november of a 448 million proposal to clean the lake was part of the reason the nation decided to file its suit this month the onondagas believe the plan is insufficient and say they were not adequately consulted about it , as required under the superfund law state officials have defended the plan , calling it comprehensive and saying the onondagas were given sufficient opportunity to comment while the onondagas' lawsuit did not surprise state and county officials , its environmental thrust apparently did officials from onondaga county said the nation had not been prominent among the region s environmental advocates they 've always spoken a lot of words centered around the earth and the water , said nicholas j pirro , the onondaga county executive , but to say that they 're activists , i do n't know if i 've seen that the public response to the lawsuit has been surprisingly subdued onondaga nation officials were bracing for negative reactions from homeowners throughout the claim area , but so far , they say , none have emerged mr pirro said his office had not received a single call from a constituent seeking information about the lawsuit the lawsuit involves five land purchases mr heath calls them takings four of the transactions , which pertain to a 108squaremile parcel that includes syracuse , are similar to deals that have been successfully challenged in other indian land claims , legal scholars say the fifth transaction , executed under a 1788 treaty , covers the remainder of the claim area and is being challenged using an untested argument , mr heath said the onondagas contend that the 1788 treaty was not authorized by official representatives of the onondaga nation and was ratified by the new york legislature only after the passage of the united states constitution and federal laws that placed indian treaties under federal jurisdiction onondaga representatives have started to make the rounds of public forums and newspaper editorial boards to respond to questions and solicit support for their cause they speak of reconciliation and healing between them and the other residents of central new york , and steer the conversation toward discussions about the environment mr heath often points to the first paragraph of the lawsuit , saying he has never written anything like it in his legal career it reads , in part the people are one with the land and consider themselves stewards of it it is the duty of the nation s leaders to work for a healing of this land , to protect it and to pass it on to future generations
when he was asked yesterday if the signing of larry brown to coach the knicks , the end of the national hockey league lockout and the disappearance of the west side stadium fight offered evidence of brighter times at madison square garden , james l dolan offered a oneword response yes he uttered it with a selfsatisfied smile but with none of the zip of marv albert , his least favorite former knicks announcer dolan , the chief executive of cablevision and the chairman of the garden , must view brown as cash flow larry sure , dolan will pay brown a lot \( from 8 million to 10 million annually , for four or five years , depending on which report you trust \) , but he is counting on brown as any needy , listing company would regard a turnaround artist with the 64yearold brown s successful , if peripatetic , past dolan wants brown to teach his underachieving knicks to win , get them into the playoffs \( to snare those 15 millionplus home game payoffs \) , increase ticket sales \( so he can raise ticket prices commensurate with what a titlist should get \) and increase knicks ratings on msg network and fox sports new york \( which sagged by 39 percent last season to 105 , or 76 , 650 households a game \) brown is too politically astute to acknowledge any pressure to be the corporate savior instead , he made the knicks' job sound like any other he had encountered from the clippers to the 76ers to the nets to the pacers everywhere i 've been , there s been a big challenge , he said he promised that the start would be rocky it will be ugly early , he said that s my mo whether you believe that brown will be fairly compensated or grossly overpaid , it is market value for a championshipwinning coach and a positive investment of cablevision s cash as long as his health and his interest hold out brown s services will cost less than half the 221 million the new york public interest research group reported that cablevision paid in 2004 in lobbying and advertising to defeat the jets' proposal to build a 2 billionplus stadium on the far west side of manhattan killing the jets' dream might have been the best victory for the garden s owners since the rangers won the stanley cup 11 years ago , but it was a bruising game of civic murderball that benefited only the dolan family brown only flashed his winner s smile and laughed heartily when asked if he was pleased that there would be no stadium on the west side the garden can pay for brown with the 398 million it will save if it waives shooting guard allan houston this summer a provision of the new collectivebargaining agreement allows each team to waive one player without paying the luxury tax on his salary , although each player must get the cash coming to him by parting with houston with two years left on his deal , and getting brown , who is 30 years older , the knicks would retain a more useful corporate asset as such an asset , he will be more popular than dolan his father , charles or anyone in the company s hierarchy so why not pay him the same , or more , than dolan , whose compensation totaled 83 million in 2004 \? brown becomes the immediate face of the garden , a more marketable , credible commodity than anyone on the knicks' or the rangers' roster knicks telecasts will be full of brown s visage as viewers watch him try to recast the misfiring team brown is a symbol of hope in a garden that has lately been devoid of promise msg network lost the yankees' and the nets' cable tv rights to yes network and will lose the mets to the team s new channel after this season a 63day dispute in the spring kept msg and fsny and thus , the mets off time warner s local systems until may 9 more crucial , the knicks and the rangers have lacked strong pulses the rangers missed the playoffs for seven straight years before the lockout , and the knicks have reached the playoffs twice since 2000 , each time losing in the first round having the rangers back may be a mixed blessing , if past performance is prologue certainly , it is better for the garden s psyche to have people passing through the turnstiles rather than sitting at home but cablevision s quarterly report for the three months that ended march 31 showed that while the garden did not book 408 million in rangers revenues , it saved 52 million in costs , a neat lockout windfall but yesterday was not about the rangers it was about cash flow larry brown and what he will do to fill the garden , sell its luxury suites and keep wavering knicks fans from defecting to the brooklyn nets if he stays that long sports business email sportsbiz nytimescom
paris , may 19 of all the luxury food emporiums of paris , none is better known than fauchon founded in 1886 at the place de la madeleine by a pushcart grocer named auguste f lix fauchon , the company has built its reputation on signature products like its champagne mustard , marrons glac s and strawberry and rose water preserves tiny pink fauchon purses serve as boxes for two fauchon chocolates about 120 teas , 50 vinegars , 131 jams , 30 forms of foie gras and 50 honeys are offered by fauchon but h las , fauchon is in trouble michel ducros , its president and chief , announced earlier this week that he was selling 9 of fauchon s 12 satellite shops in paris to the rival gourmet food chain len tre the sale price is being kept confidential a 10th store is being sold to another buyer the two other stores in paris were sold last year you won the battle of paris , mr ducros told patrick scicard , the president of len tre , at a news conference in the tearoom of fauchon s flagship place de la madeleine shop and we will reorganize ourselves as a result fauchon is not going out of business , despite some reports last year that it was skirting bankruptcy it will keep its restaurant , renovate its flagship store and focus more energy on developing its overseas markets , including its 10 stores outside france \( among them its park avenue store in midtown manhattan \) i'm a man of conquests , not one of retreat , and it s never easy to pull back , mr ducros said in a phone interview thursday but i believe that a retreat in an intelligent way is better than a jolting advance it s back to basics the company estimates that it had a net loss of 101 million to 114 million for the fiscal year ended march 2005 , despite pledges that it would turn a profit the company lost 139 million in the year ended march 2004 for len tre , the restaurant , catering , retail and cooking school empire , the purchase adds to its already thriving business it has eight shops in paris len tre is the caterer for president jacques chirac s annual bastille day garden party at the elys e palace and many of the receptions and dinners at versailles len tre , which belongs to the accor group , last year had 115 million in sales its paris stores generated 354 million of that , and the company predicts the acquisition of the fauchon stores will add 331 million the fauchon stores will be renovated in july and august and open for business by september i do n't want to be pretentious , but we 're going to try to make the clientele of fauchon faithful to us , mr scicard of len tre said in a phone interview we must be innovative , but to find the right dose of tradition and innovations requires subtlety fauchon bought the dozen stores in paris with much fanfare in 2002 from the flo prestige catering and restaurant group for 39 million , hoping to build a presence throughout the city in january 2004 , a private equitybacked consortium led by mr ducros acquired a 51 percent stake in fauchon for an undisclosed sum but to its faithful customers , the satellite stores never had the cachet of the madeleine address the clientele of flo prestige , a middlemarket catering and dry goods chain , seemed intimidated by the fauchon name the quality of the produce and freshly prepared foods was uneven in addition , all small luxury food shops have faced increased competition from department stores that have expanded their own outlets , including the lafayette gourmet shop in galeries lafayette and the grande epicerie in the bon march department store the luxury market has to keep thinking of ways to keep people interested , and maybe fauchon was n't innovative enough , said caroline taylor , a senior retail analyst at mintel , a market research firm based in london genuine luxury buyers want something different , and maybe the classic fauchon logo tins were n't enough she added that on a trip to paris just a few weeks ago , i noticed fauchon was empty , while the department stores were booming mr scicard of len tre had a different explanation fauchon was too focused on its madeleine store , and it called on other outside providers to make products for its other stores , he said mr ducros acknowledged mistakes we expanded too quickly , he said we had too much ambition but he says he is confident the company will endure we are unique , he said
in the dark before dawn , when madison avenue was all but deserted and its pricey boutiques were still locked up tight , several mexicans slipped quietly into 3 guys , a restaurant that the zagat guide once called the most expensive coffee shop in new york for the next 10 hours they would fry eggs , grill burgers , pour coffee and wash dishes for a stream of customers from the upper east side of manhattan by 7 35 am , eliot spitzer , attorney general of new york , was holding a power breakfast back near the polished granite counter in the same burgundy booth a few hours later , michael a wiener , cofounder of the multibilliondollar infinity broadcasting , grabbed a bite with his wife , zena just the day before , uma thurman slipped in for a quiet lunch with her children , but the paparazzi found her and she left more mexicans filed in to begin their shifts throughout the morning , and by the time john zannikos , one of the restaurant s three greek owners , drove in from the north jersey suburbs to work the lunch crowd , madison avenue was buzzing so was 3 guys you got to wait a little bit , mr zannikos said to a pride of elegant women who had spent the morning at the whitney museum of american art , across madison avenue at 75th street for an illiterate immigrant who came to new york years ago with nothing but 100 in his pocket and a willingness to work etched on his heart , could any words have been sweeter to say \? with its wealthy clientele , middleclass owners and lowincome work force , 3 guys is a template of the class divisions in america but it is also the setting for two starkly different tales about breaching those divides the familiar story is mr zannikos s for him , the restaurant do n't dare call it a diner with its 20 salads and elegant d cor represents the american promise of upward mobility , one that has been fulfilled countless times for generations of hardworking immigrants but for juan manuel peralta , a 34yearold illegal immigrant who worked there for five years until he was fired last may , and for many of the other illegal mexican immigrants in the back , restaurant work today is more like a dead end they are finding the american dream of moving up far more elusive than it was for mr zannikos despite his efforts to help them , they risk becoming stuck in a permanent underclass of the poor , the unskilled and the uneducated that is not to suggest that the nearly five million mexicans who , like mr peralta , are living in the united states illegally will never emerge from the shadows many have , and undoubtedly many more will but the sheer size of the influx over 400 , 000 a year , with no end in sight creates a problem all its own it means there is an evergrowing pool of interchangeable workers , many of them shunting from one lowpaying job to another if one moves on , another one or maybe two or three is there to take his place although mr peralta arrived in new york almost 40 years after mr zannikos , the two share a remarkably similar beginning they came at the same age to the same section of new york city , without legal papers or more than a few words of english each dreamed of a better life but monumental changes in the economy and in attitudes toward immigrants have made it far less likely that mr peralta and his children will experience the same upward mobility as mr zannikos and his family of course , there is a chance that mr peralta may yet take his place among the mexicanamericans who have succeeded here he realizes that he will probably not do as well as the few who have risen to high office or who were able to buy the vineyards where their grandfathers once picked grapes but he still dreams that his children will someday join the millions who have lost their accents , gotten good educations and firmly achieved the american dream political scientists are divided over whether the 25 million people of mexican ancestry in the united states represent an exception to the classic immigrant success story some , like john h mollenkopf at the city university of new york , are convinced that mexicans will eventually do as well as the greeks , italians and other europeans of the last century who were usually well assimilated after two or three generations others , including mexicanamericans like rodolfo o de la garza , a professor at columbia , have done studies showing that mexicanamericans face so many obstacles that even the fourth generation trails other americans in education , home ownership and household income the situation is even worse for the millions more who have illegally entered the united states since 1990 spread out in scores of cities far beyond the southwest , they find jobs plentiful but advancement difficult president vicente fox of mexico was forced to apologize this month for declaring publicly what many mexicans say they feel , that the illegal immigrants are doing the work that not even blacks want to do in the united states resentment and race subtly stand in their way , as does a lingering attachment to mexico , which is so close that many immigrants do not put down deep roots here they say they plan to stay only long enough to make some money and then go back home few ever do but the biggest obstacle is their illegal status with few routes open to become legal , they remain , like mr peralta , without rights , without security and without a clear path to a better future it s worrisome , said richard alba , a sociologist at the state university of new york , albany , who studies the assimilation and class mobility of contemporary immigrants , and i do n't see much reason to believe this will change little has changed for mr peralta , a cook who has worked at menial jobs in the united states for the last 15 years though he makes more than he ever dreamed of in mexico , his life is anything but middle class and setbacks are routine still , he has not given up hope querer es poder , he sometimes says want something badly enough and you will get it but desire may not be enough anymore that is what concerns arturo sarukhan , mexico s consul general in new york mr sarukhan recently took an urgent call from new york s police commissioner about an increase in gang activity among young mexican men , a sign that they were moving into the underside of american life of all immigrants in new york city , officials say , mexicans are the poorest , least educated and least likely to speak english the failure or success of this generation of mexicans in the united states will determine the place that mexicans will hold here in years to come , mr sarukhan said , and the outlook is not encouraging they will be better off than they could ever have been in mexico , he said , but i do n't think that s going to be enough to prevent them from becoming an underclass in new york different results there is a break in the middle of the day at 3 guys , after the lunchtime limousines leave and before the private schools let out that was when mr zannikos asked the mexican cook who replaced mr peralta to prepare some lunch for him then mr zannikos carried the chicken breast on pita to the last table in the restaurant my life story is a good story , a lot of success , he said , his accent still heavy he was just a teenager when he left the greek island of chios , a few miles off the coast of turkey world war ii had just ended , and greece was in ruins there was only rich and poor , that s it , mr zannikos said there was no middle class like you have here he is 70 now , with short gray hair and soft eyes that can water at a mention of the past because of the war , he said , he never got past the second grade , never learned to read or write he signed on as a merchant seaman , and in 1953 , when he was 19 , his ship docked at norfolk , va he went ashore one saturday with no intention of ever returning to greece he left behind everything , including his travel documents all he had in his pockets was 100 and the address of his mother s cousin in the jackson heightscorona section of queens almost four decades later , mr peralta underwent a similar rite of passage out of mexico he had finished the eighth grade in the poor southern state of guerrero and saw nothing in his future there but fixing flat tires his father , inocencio , had once dreamed of going to the united states , but never had the money in 1990 , he borrowed enough to give his firstborn son a chance mr peralta was 19 when he boarded a smoky bus that carried him through the deserted hills of guerrero and kept going until it reached the edge of mexico with eight other mexicans he did not know , he crawled through a sewer tunnel that started in tijuana and ended on the other side of the border , in what mexicans call el norte he had carried no documents , no photographs and no money , except what his father gave him to pay his shifty guide and to buy an airline ticket to new york deep in a pocket was the address of an uncle in the same section of queens where mr zannikos had gotten his start by 1990 , the area had gone from largely greek to mostly latino starting over in the same workingclass neighborhood , mr peralta and mr zannikos quickly learned that new york was full of opportunities and obstacles , often in equal measure on his first day there , mr zannikos , scared and feeling lost , found the building he was looking for , but his mother s cousin had moved he had no idea what to do until a greek man passed by walk five blocks to the deluxe diner , the man said he did the diner was full of greek housepainters , including one who knew mr zannikos s father on the spot , they offered him a job painting closets , where his mistakes would be hidden he painted until the weather turned cold another greek hired him as a dishwasher at his coffee shop in the bronx it was not easy , but mr zannikos worked his way up to shortorder cook , learning english as he went along in 1956 , immigration officials raided the coffee shop he was deported , but after a short while he managed to sneak back into the country three years later he married a puerto rican from the bronx the marriage lasted only a year , but it put him on the road to becoming a citizen now he could buy his own restaurant , a greasy spoon in the south bronx that catered to a latenight clientele of prostitutes and undercover police officers since then , he has bought and sold more than a dozen new york diners , but none have been more successful than the original 3 guys , which opened in 1978 he and his partners own two other restaurants with the same name farther up madison avenue , but they have never replicated the highend appeal of the original when employees come in i teach them , 'hey , this is a different neighborhood , ' mr zannikos said what may be standard in some other diners is not tolerated here there are no greek flags or tourism posters there is no television or twirling tower of cakes with cream pompadours waiters are forbidden to chew gum no customer is ever called honey they know their place and i know my place , mr zannikos said of his customers it s as simple as that his place in society now is a far cry from his days in the bronx he and his second wife , june , live in wyckoff , a new jersey suburb where he pampers fig trees and dutifully looks after a bird feeder shaped like the parthenon they own a condominium in florida his three children all went far beyond his secondgrade education , finishing high school or attending college they have all done well , as has mr zannikos , who says he makes about 130 , 000 a year he says he is not sensitive to class distinctions , but he admits he was bothered when some people mistook him for the caterer at fundraising dinners for the local greek church he helped build all in all , he thinks immigrants today have a better chance of moving up the class ladder than he did 50 years ago at that time , no bank would give us any money , but today they give you credit cards in the mail , he said new york still gives you more opportunity that any other place if you want to do things , you will he says he has done well , and he is content with his station in life i'm in the middle and i'm happy a divisive issue mr peralta cannot guess what class mr zannikos belongs to but he is certain that it is much tougher for an immigrant to get ahead today than 50 years ago and he has no doubt about his own class la pobreza , he says poverty it was not what he expected when he boarded the bus to the border , but it did not take long for him to realize that success in the united states required more than hard work a lot of it has to do with luck , he said during a lunch break on a stoop around the corner from the queens diner where he went to work after 3 guys people come here , and in no more than a year or two they can buy their own house and have a car , mr peralta said me , i 've been here 15 years , and if i die tomorrow , there would n't even be enough money to bury me in 1990 , mr peralta was in the vanguard of mexican immigrants who bypassed the traditional barrios in border states to work in farflung cities like denver and new york the 2000 census counted 186 , 872 mexicans in new york , triple the 1990 figure , and there are undoubtedly many more today the mexican consulate , which serves the metropolitan region , has issued more than 500 , 000 id cards just since 2001 fifty years ago , illegal immigration was a minor problem now it is a divisive national issue , pitting those who welcome cheap labor against those with concerns about border security and the cost of providing social services though newly arrived mexicans often work in industries that rely on cheap labor , like restaurants and construction , they rarely organize most are desperate to stay out of sight mr peralta hooked up with his uncle the morning he arrived in new york he did not work for weeks until the bakery where the uncle worked had an opening , a parttime job making muffins he took it , though he did n't know muffins from crumb cake when he saw that he would not make enough to repay his father , he took a second job making night deliveries for a manhattan diner by the end of his first day he was so lost he had to spend all his tip money on a cab ride home he quit the diner , but working there even briefly opened his eyes to how easy it could be to make money in new york diners were everywhere , and so were jobs making deliveries , washing dishes or busing tables in six months , mr peralta had paid back the money his father gave him he bounced from job to job and in 1995 , eager to show off his newfound success , he went back to mexico with his pockets full of money , and he married he was 25 then , the same age at which mr zannikos married but the similarities end there when mr zannikos jumped ship , he left greece behind for good though he himself had no documents , the compatriots he encountered on his first days were here legally , like most other greek immigrants , and could help him greeks had never come to the united states in large numbers the 2000 census counted only 29 , 805 new yorkers born in greece but they tended to settle in just a few areas , like the astoria section of queens , which became cohesive communities ready to help new arrivals mr peralta , like many other mexicans , is trying to make it on his own and has never severed his emotional or financial ties to home after five years in new york s latino community , he spoke little english and owned little more than the clothes on his back he decided to return to huamuxtitl n \( pronounced wamooshteetlahn \) , the dusty village beneath a flattopped mountain where he was born people thought that since i was coming back from el norte , i would be so rich that i could spread money around , he said still , he felt privileged his new york wages dwarfed the 1 , 000 a year he might have made in mexico he met a shy , pretty girl named matilde in huamuxtitl n , married her and returned with her to new york , again illegally , all in a matter of weeks their first child was born in 1996 mr peralta soon found that supporting a family made it harder to save money then , in 1999 , he got the job at 3 guys barba yanni helped me learn how to prepare things the way customers like them , mr peralta said , referring to mr zannikos with a greek title of respect that means uncle john the restaurant became his school he learned how to saut a fish so that it looked like a work of art the three partners lent him money and said they would help him get immigration documents the pay was good but there were tensions with the other workers instead of hanging their orders on a rack , the waiters shouted them out , in greek , spanish and a kind of fractured english sometimes mr peralta did not understand , and they argued soon he was known as a hothead still , he worked hard , and every night he returned to his growing family matilde , now 27 , cleaned houses until the second child , heidi , was born three years ago now she tries to sell mary kay products to other mothers at public school 12 , which their son , antony , 8 , attends most weeks , mr peralta could make as much as 600 over the course of a year that could come to over 30 , 000 , enough to approach the lower middle class but the life he leads is far from that and uncertainty hovers over everything about his life , starting with his paycheck to earn 600 , he has to work at least 10 hours a day , six days a week , and that does not happen every week sometimes he is paid overtime for the extra hours , sometimes not and , as he found out in may , he can be fired at any time and bring in nothing , not even unemployment , until he lands another job in 2004 , he made about 24 , 000 because he is here illegally , mr peralta can easily be exploited he cannot file a complaint against his landlord for charging him 500 a month for a 9footby9foot room in a queens apartment that he shares with nine other mexicans in three families who pay the remainder of the 2 , 000amonth rent all 13 share one bathroom , and the established pecking order means the peraltas rarely get to use the kitchen eating out can be expensive because they were born in new york , mr peralta s children are united states citizens , and their health care is generally covered by medicaid but he has to pay out of his pocket whenever he or his wife sees a doctor and forget about going to the dentist as many other mexicans do , he wires money home , and it costs him 7 for every 100 he sends when his uncle , his nephew and his sister asked him for money , he was expected to lend it no one has paid him back he has middleclass ornaments , like a cellphone and a dvd player , but no driver s license or social security card he is the first to admit that he has vices that have held him back nothing criminal , but he tends to lose his temper and there are nights when he likes to have a drink or two his greatest weakness is instant lottery tickets , what he calls los scratch , and he sheepishly confesses that he can squander as much as 75 a week on them it is a way of preserving hope , he said once he won 100 he bought a blender years ago , he and matilde were so confident they would make it in america that when their son was born they used the american spelling of his name , anthony , figuring it would help pave his passage into the mainstream but even that effort failed look at this , his wife said one afternoon as she sat on the floor of their room near a picture of the virgin of guadalupe mr peralta sat on a small plastic stool in the doorway , listening his mattress was stacked against the wall a roll of toilet paper was stashed nearby because they dared not leave it in the shared bathroom for someone else to use she took her pocketbook and pulled out a clear plastic case holding her son s baptismal certificate , on which his name is spelled with an h but then she unfolded his birth certificate , where the h is missing the teachers wo n't teach him to spell his name the right way until the certificate is legally changed , she said but how can we do that if we 're not legal \? progress , but not success an elevated subway train thundered overhead , making the afternoon light along roosevelt avenue blink like a failing fluorescent bulb mr peralta s daughter and son grabbed his fat hands as they ran some errands he had just finished a 10hour shift , eggs over easy and cheeseburgers since 5 am it had been especially hard to stand the monotony that day he kept thinking about what was going on in mexico , where it was the feast day of our lady of the rosary and , oh , what a feast there was sweets and handmade tamales , a parade , even a bullfight at night , fireworks , bursting loud and bright against the green folds of the mountains paid for , in part , by the money he sends home but instead of partying , he was walking his children to the arab supermarket on roosevelt avenue to buy packages of chicken and spare ribs , and hoping to get to use the kitchen and though he knew better , he grabbed a package of pink and white marshmallows for the children he needed to buy tortillas , too , but not there a korean convenience store a few blocks away sells la maizteca tortillas , made in new york the swirl of immigrants in mr peralta s neighborhood is part of the fabric of new york , just as it was in 1953 , when mr zannikos arrived but most immigrants then were europeans , and though they spoke different languages , their caucasian features helped them blend into new york s middle class experts remain divided over whether mexicans can follow the same route samuel p huntington , a harvard professor of government , takes the extreme view that mexicans will not assimilate and that the separate culture they are developing threatens the united states most others believe that recent mexican immigrants will eventually take their place in society , and perhaps someday muster political clout commensurate with their numbers , though significant impediments are slowing their progress francisco riverabatiz , a columbia university economics professor , says that prejudice remains a problem , that factory jobs have all but disappeared , and that there is a growing gap between the educational demands of the economy and the limited schooling that the newest mexicans have when they arrive but the biggest obstacle by far , and the one that separates newly arrived mexicans from greeks , italians and most other immigrants including earlier generations of mexicans is their illegal status professor riverabatiz studied what happened to illegal mexican immigrants who became legal after the last national amnesty in 1986 within a few years , their incomes rose 20 percent and their english improved greatly legalization , he said , helped them tremendously although the bush administration is again talking about legalizing some mexicans with a guest worker program , there is opposition to another amnesty , and the number of mexicans illegally living in the united states continues to soar desperate to get their papers any way they can , many turn to shady storefront legal offices like mr peralta , they sign on to illusory schemes that cost hundreds of dollars but almost never produce the promised green cards until the 1980 s , mexican immigration was largely seasonal and mostly limited to agricultural workers but then economic chaos in mexico sent a flood of immigrants northward , many of them poorly educated farmers from the impoverished countryside tighter security on the border made it harder for mexicans to move back and forth in the traditional way , so they tended to stay here , searching for lowpaying unskilled jobs and concentrating in barrios where spanish , constantly replenished , never loses its immediacy cuidado ! mr peralta shouted when antony carelessly stepped into roosevelt avenue without looking although the boy is taught in english at school , he rarely uses anything but spanish at home even now , after 15 years in new york , mr peralta speaks little english he tried english classes once , but could not get his mind to accept the new sounds so he dropped it , and has stuck with only spanish , which he concedes is the language of busboys in new york but as long as he stays in his neighborhood , it is all he needs it was late afternoon by the time mr peralta and his children headed home the rundown house , the overheated room , the stacked mattress and the hoarded toilet paper all remind him how far he would have to go to achieve a success like mr zannikos s still , he says , he has done far better than he could ever have done in mexico he realizes that the money he sends to his family there is not enough to satisfy his father , who built stairs for a second floor of his house made of concrete blocks in huamuxtitl n , even though there is no second floor he believes manuel has made it big in new york and he is waiting for money from america to complete the upstairs manuel has never told him the truth about his life up north he said his father s images of america came from another era the older man does not know how tough it is to be a mexican immigrant in the united states now , tougher than any young man who ever left huamuxtitl n would admit everything built up over 15 years here can come apart as easily as an adobe house in an earthquake and then it is time to start over , again a conflict erupts it was the end of another busy lunch at 3 guys in late spring 2003 mr peralta made himself a turkey sandwich and took a seat at a rear table the mexican countermen , dishwashers and busboys also started their breaks , while the greek waiters took care of the last few diners it is not clear how the argument started but a cross word passed between a greek waiter and a mexican busboy voices were raised the waiter swung at the busboy , catching him behind the ear mr peralta froze so did the other mexicans even from the front of the restaurant , where he was watching the cash register , mr zannikos realized something was wrong and rushed back to break it up i stood between them , held one and pushed the other away , he said i told them 'you do n't do that here never do that here ' mr zannikos said he did not care who started it he ordered both the busboy and the waiter , a partner s nephew , to get out but several mexicans , including mr peralta , said that they saw mr zannikos grab the busboy by the head and that they believed he would have hit him if another mexican had not stepped between them that infuriated them because they felt he had sided with the greek without knowing who was at fault mr zannikos said that was not true , but in the end it did not matter the easygoing atmosphere at the restaurant changed everybody was a little cool , mr zannikos recalled what he did not know then was that the mexicans had reached out to the restaurant opportunities center , a workers' rights group eventually six of them , including mr peralta , cooperated with the group he did so reluctantly , he said , because he was afraid that if the owners found out , they would no longer help him get his immigration papers the labor group promised that the owners would never know the owners saw it as an effort to shake them down , but for the mexicans it became a class struggle pitting powerless workers against hardhearted owners their grievances went beyond the scuffle they complained that with just one exception , only greeks became waiters at 3 guys they challenged the sole mexican waiter , salomon paniagua , a former mexican army officer who , everyone agreed , looked greek , to stand with them but on the day the labor group picketed the restaurant , mr paniagua refused to put down his order pad a handful of demonstrators carried signs on madison avenue for a short while before mr zannikos and his partners reluctantly agreed to settle mr zannikos said he felt betrayed when i see these guys , i see myself when i started , and i always try to help them , he said i did n't do anything wrong the busboy and the mexican who intervened were paid several thousand dollars and the owners promised to promote a current mexican employee to waiter within a month but that did not end the turmoil fearing that the other mexicans might try to get back at him , mr paniagua decided to strike out on his own after asking mr zannikos for advice , he bought a onethird share of a greek diner in jamaica , queens he said he put it in his father s name because the older man had become a legal resident after the 1986 amnesty after mr paniagua left , 3 guys went without a single mexican waiter for 10 months , despite the terms of the settlement in march , an eager mexican busboy with a heavy accent who had worked there for four years got a chance to wear a waiter s tie mr peralta ended up having to leave 3 guys around the same time as mr paniagua mr zannikos s partners suspected he had sided with the labor group , he said , and started to criticize his work unfairly then they cut back his schedule to five days a week after he hurt his ankle playing soccer , they told him to go home until he was better when mr peralta came back to work about two weeks later , he was fired mr zannikos confirms part of the account but says the firing had nothing to do with the scuffle or the ensuing dispute if he was good , believe me , he would n't get fired , he said of mr peralta mr peralta shrugged when told what mr zannikos said i know my own work and i know what i can do , he said there are a lot of restaurants in new york , and a lot of workers when 3 guys fired mr peralta , another mexican replaced him , just as mr peralta replaced a mexican at the greek diner in queens where he went to work next this time , though , there was no madison avenue address , no elaborate menu of new zealand mussels or designer mushrooms in the queens diner a bowl of soup with a buttered roll cost 2 , all day if he fried burgers and scraped fat off the big grill for 10 hours a day , six days a week , he might earn about as much as he did on madison avenue , at least for a week his schedule kept changing sometimes he worked the lunch and dinner shift , and by the end of the night he was worn out , especially since he often found himself arguing with the greek owner but he did not look forward to going home so after the night manager lowered the security gate , mr peralta would wander the streets one of those nights he stopped at a phone center off roosevelt avenue to call his mother everything s ok , he told her he asked how she had spent the last 100 he sent , and whether she needed anything else there is always need in huamuxtitl n still restless , he went to the scorpion , a shotandbeer joint open till 4 am he sat at the long bar nursing vodkas with cranberry juice , glancing at the soccer match on tv and the busty brazilian bartender who spoke only a little spanish when it was nearly 11 pm , he called it a night back home , he quietly opened the door to his room the lights were off , the television murmuring his family was asleep in the bunk bed that the store had now threatened to repossess antony was curled up on the top , matilde and heidi cuddled in the bottom mr peralta moved the plastic stool out of the way and dropped his mattress to the floor the children did not stir his wife s eyes fluttered , but she said nothing mr peralta looked over his family , his home this , he said , is my life in new york not the life he imagined , but his life in early march , just after heidi s third birthday , he quit his job at the queens diner after yet another heated argument with the owner in his mind , preserving his dignity is one of the few liberties he has left i 'll get another job , he said while babysitting heidi at home a few days later the rent is already paid till the end of the month and he has friends , he said people know him to him , jobs are interchangeable just as he is to the jobs if he cannot find work as a grillman , he will bus tables or wash dishes if not at one diner , then at another it s all the same , he said it took about three weeks , but mr peralta did find a new job as a grillman at another greek diner in a different part of new york his salary is roughly the same , the menu is roughly the same \( one new item , greek burritos , was a natural \) , and he sees his chance for a better future as being roughly the same as it has been since he got to america a long day closes it was now dark again outside 3 guys about 9 pm mr zannikos asked his mexican cook for a small salmon steak , a little rare it had been another busy 10hour day for him , but a good one receipts from the morning alone exceeded what he needed to take in every day just to cover the 23 , 000 a month rent he finished the salmon quickly , left final instructions with the lone greek waiter still on duty and said good night to everyone else he put on his light tan corduroy jacket and the baseball cap he picked up in florida night , he said to the lone table of diners outside , as mr zannikos walked slowly down madison avenue , a selfmade man comfortable with his own hardwon success , the bulkhead doors in front of 3 guys clanked open faint voices speaking spanish came from below a young mexican who started his shift 10 hours earlier climbed out with a bag of garbage and heaved it onto the sidewalk new zealand mussel shells uneaten bits of portobello mushrooms the fine grounds of decaf cappuccino one black plastic bag after another came out until madison avenue in front of 3 guys was piled high with trash hurry up ! the young man shouted to the other mexicans i want to go home , too about the

michael r bloomberg is enjoying the highest approval rating of his term as mayor , receiving more credit for his education policies and drawing increased support from hispanics , liberals , moderates , and residents of manhattan , a new york times poll has found as he gears up his reelection campaign , mr bloomberg s jobapproval rating stands at 50 percent , double where it was in july 2003 , and a seven percentage point increase from february the rise comes after a concerted effort by the bloomberg camp to make voters more comfortable with the mayor , a democratic businessman turned republican politician , and with his performance on the three top concerns for new yorkers polled schools , housing and jobs on critical issues , from ground zero redevelopment and the proposed west side stadium to jobs and taxes , mr bloomberg also appears relatively unscathed by months of criticism from his democratic opponents in the mayor s race according to the poll , mr bloomberg leads his closest challenger , fernando ferrer , the former bronx borough president , 48 percent to 35 percent the citywide poll of 901 adults , conducted between june 21 and sunday , found that mr ferrer had the widest backing of the four democrats running for mayor , with support from 34 percent of registered democrats c virginia fields , the manhattan borough president , received 20 percent , up from 12 percent in the february poll representative anthony weiner drew 10 percent and city council speaker gifford miller 7 percent none of mr bloomberg s democratic opponents have begun any advertising to even begin to match the multimilliondollar ad purchases of the bloomberg campaign , which have promoted his record on education , an issue that partly drove the surge in his approval rating more than half of voters have seen a bloomberg ad , with 17 percent thinking better of him afterward and 10 percent thinking worse yet it is also clear that many new yorkers are not paying attention to the mayoral race just yet a quarter of democrats remain undecided about their party s primary , and most voters have not formed an opinion of the democratic candidates perhaps the most significant finding was that new yorkers have begun to credit mr bloomberg with what he considers his signature policies as mayor asked how much credit he deserved for rising test scores in the schools , 66 percent said a lot or some mr bloomberg has said that voters should judge him principally on education of the 901 adults surveyed , 665 said they were registered to vote in turn , 48 percent of the voters say mr bloomberg deserves reelection , up from 27 percent last august the poll has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points , and four percentage points for registered voters he was better than i thought i underrated him , james upton , 65 , a democrat and retired security officer who lives in the east 20 s in manhattan , said in a followup interview the other guy says he s going to do this , that , and the other thing , but actions prove louder than words i just feel he s doing a pretty good job and i do n't want to upset the apple cart of the 48 percent who have a favorable opinion of mr bloomberg , half said that at some time during his term in office they did not like him in interviews , several of these voters said they had changed their minds because they liked or appreciated mr bloomberg s approach to the most pressing urban challenges and grew to see him as focused on their concerns , even though he is a billionaire i had originally thought , this is a person with no political experience , this is a business leader , and he s only going to have the interests of the upper class and corporate interests in mind , said jessica kesselman , 35 , a democrat from morningside heights who is a former city schoolteacher and is now a fulltime mother i have to say i was pleasantly surprised when not only was education such a central focus early on , but it has stayed a central focus all the way through the new poll suggested that the mayor was having significant success in getting the message that he deserved a second term out to new yorkers the last mayor , rudolph w giuliani , had a 56 percent approval rating during a similar period in his 1997 reelection campaign but the new poll also indicated some possible trouble spots for the mayor , although his democratic rivals have had little success in exploiting them on the most important issues , 64 percent of those polled said they were not satisfied with the quality of public schools in new york city , compared with 24 percent who said they were fortyfive percent said they believed that the amount of affordable housing had decreased under mr bloomberg , while 27 said the stock of such housing had grown the public school system is in bad shape , said anthony lee , a bronx democrat and a youth counselor with children in public school for one , they 're overcrowded , he said , adding , teachers are n't paid what they should be paid , so they do n't do the best jobs that they should be doing the mayor s opponents have also chided him as preoccupied with manhattan at the expense of the other boroughs , a view that 67 percent of voters shared and 24 percent did not fiftysix percent believed that mr bloomberg had not visited their neighborhood since becoming mayor albeit at an early stage of the race , the poll had mixed news for the electoral strategy of mr ferrer
port st lucie , fla , april 1 there is a patch of grass deep in any rightcenterfield alley that has been littered over the years with triples and broken bones for the 2005 mets , this treacherous stretch of turf will serve either as the starting point for a seasonlong collision course or the place where two new teammates yield to each other in the interest of covering greater ground there will come a moment this season , perhaps as early as opening day in cincinnati on monday afternoon , when a fly ball will rise toward rightcenter players on 29 major league teams would probably not even pause between sunflower seeds players on the mets are more likely to hold their breath in suspense carlos beltran , this year s starting center fielder , will dash to his left mike cameron , last year s starting center fielder , will dart to his right beltran is the free agent who signed a 119 million contract over the winter and coined the new mets slogan cameron , in his second season with the team , is already among the old mets they will meet in the middle , in what the mets hope to be a neutral zone how their paths cross could reveal whether the new mets can coexist with the old ones , or if past and present are destined to collide and go down because beltran is the center fielder , he has the mandate to call anyone else off but because cameron is a twotime gold glovewinning center fielder who was moved to right this year , his instinct is still to chase any ball in his line of vision one of them will have to defer for the sake of the team s longterm health , particularly with cameron still bothered by his surgically repaired left wrist , which could keep him out opening day the center fielder has priority , beltran said if the center fielder calls , you 've got to get out of the way cameron said i'm not going to change my game i have to play the same style i always have all the mets are being asked to adapt in some way this season to a new general manager , a new manager , two new superstars and a new organizational philosophy the transition , for the outfielders , the pitching staff , the batting order and the front office , figures to take more time than fans might hope it is hard to imagine a club that lost more than 90 games in each of the past three seasons rebuilding its roster quickly and smoothly the dynamic between beltran and cameron , which includes the potential for highlightcaliber catches as well as collisions , is emblematic of other areas on the team the mets must orient themselves to the antics of their new ace , pedro mart nez the rules of their new manager , willie randolph and the expectations of their new general manager , omar minaya the lineup is improved , but it seems mismatched , with the possibility of david wright batting eighth the defense is better , particularly with jos reyes and kazuo matsui switching positions , but they , too , must learn how to merge rightcenter field can be an example or a booby trap beltran and cameron could compose the best defensive outfield in baseball , or they could battle for the more prominent position having basically two great center fielders out there is going to be interesting , said jerry manuel , the mets' firstbase coach , who works with the outfielders it will take an adjustment , but there s a huge upside to keep beltran and cameron from breaking each other s collarbones and to take advantage of their combined range , the mets have been pushing beltran a few steps over to left field and shading cameron a bit toward the rightfield line this way , they have added responsibility and increased personal space beltran has been alerting cameron to where he is positioned before pitches and leaving him to handle most flies to right this is easier for me , because he can get to so many balls , beltran said if i see him camped underneath a ball , i'm not going to call him off i want him to take it cameron said he did not think collisions would be a problem because they had the same instincts but , you know , there are times that you ca n't avoid it , he said when beltran was a minor leaguer in the kansas city organization , he was involved in a collision so violent that it resulted in surgery on his right knee cameron helped supply one of the scarier memories of last season when he and left fielder cliff floyd plowed into each other at florida neither was seriously injured , but each said he learned the importance of communication you 've always got to be loud , floyd said and you 've got to understand that the center fielder always has the right of way what makes this situation a little different is that the right fielder has been a center fielder because beltran and cameron have the speed to reach many of those wouldbe triples in rightcenter , they will have to take slightly different angles to the ball sometimes , cameron will cut in front and beltran will glide behind him other times , beltran will have a bead on the ball and cameron will have to back him up if we can keep communicating on that , we 'll be all right , beltran said they played catch between innings of exhibition games , and coaches kept them side by side during outfield drills beltran said he told cameron that he would call for a ball when he wanted it and say nothing when he did not , except perhaps to inform cameron of how much room he had in front of the fence none of this can completely prepare them for the first high drive hit into the rightcenterfield gap beltran and cameron are natural center fielders , of similar height and weight , in constant pursuit of the same prize to reach it , they are going to have to come together while still keeping a healthy distance
in creating the lower manhattan development corporation , gov george e pataki promised it would be the entity that drives the train of lower manhattan development the question on its fourth anniversary is where the track ends we look forward to working ourselves out of business , said stefan pryor , the president of the corporation , which was never envisioned as a permanent agency but we do n't think we 've accomplished that goal yet it is not clear how the corporation will fit with mayor michael r bloomberg s plan to become more involved at ground zero he is entitled to appoint eight of the corporation s 16 directors but now has only three appointees on the board , though he pledged to fill the vacancies after the election deputy mayor daniel l doctoroff , who is not a director but represents the mayor at board meetings , said , with the exception of what s going to happen with the commercial buildings , the truth is the vast , vast majority of decisions have basically been made so naturally , he added , the role of the lmdc declines as the responsibility for actually building things devolves to the respective agencies governor pataki still views the corporation as central to the rebuilding efforts , a spokeswoman said last month , citing its responsibility for designing the 9 11 memorial and memorial museum , championing a performing arts center on the world trade center site and allocating the remaining federal redevelopment grants on sept 28 , the governor seemed to undermine the corporation when he declared while the board was reviewing the matter that the international freedom center museum could not be placed in the memorial area \( state officials note that mr pataki told the corporation to look for an alternative place for the museum , a search that might have succeeded had the freedom center executives not pulled the plug on their own project \) as a result , roland w betts , one of mr pataki s original appointees and a business partner of a freedom center cofounder , tom a bernstein , resigned from the board , saying the corporation s ongoing role has been severely marginalized other directors also considered resigning , though none are known to have done so that is not the only way in which influence and power have shifted recently john p cahill , the governor s chief of staff not the corporation chairman or president has emerged as the top downtown development official the world trade center memorial foundation has asserted itself in the construction process and the alliance for downtown new york and community board 1 have lost representation on the board supporters still see the corporation as a vital intermediary among the many groups with a stake at ground zero they contend that it is reaching a critical point in designing the memorial and they point out that it must oversee demolition of the former deutsche bank building , which it owns , a process that will last until 2007 they envision the corporation as the defender of daniel libeskind s master site plan as the advocate of a performing arts center , for which the board committed 50 million , and of cultural institutions generally downtown and as the partner in redevelopment projects in chinatown , at the hudson river park , on fulton and greenwich streets and along the east river waterfront robert p balachandran , the former president and chief executive of the hudson river park trust , whom mr pataki appointed to the board in 2004 , said , our role is even more crystalline and important now than it ever was before the lower manhattan redevelopment corporation , as it was first called , was created nov 5 , 2001 , as a subsidiary of the state s urban development corporation charles a gargano , the chairman of the parent corporation , said it would oversee all aspects of revitalizing and rebuilding lower manhattan faced with the possibility that mark green , a democrat , would be elected mayor , the republican administration in albany allocated six of nine board seats to the governor and three to the mayor in april 2002 , with a republican mayor in office , the board was expanded to 16 members the mayor and governor were each given eight appointees that sounds like citystate parity , but the urban development corporation owns all the shares in the lower manhattan development corporation , which was incorporated in december 2001 it was granted all purposes , powers and functions entrusted to the udc , including property condemnation , and charged with the implementation and management of redevelopment south of houston street what gave the fledgling corporation real power was its designation in january 2002 , by federal law , as the conduit of a 2 billion community development grant from the department of housing and urban development it was designated eight months later to distribute an additional 783 million grant there is still roughly 400 million to be distributed , almost guaranteeing that the corporation will operate for some time so does its role , established by executive order in 2003 , as the state s lead agency for environmental reviews of redevelopment plans financed by the hud grants in other words , no one will be turning off the lights any time soon but recent events have taken a toll the corporation which worked with relatives of 9 11 victims , revised the master plan with public input and handled federal grants without scandal was mortally wounded in the freedom center case , said a former director , who asked not to be identified so as not to be publicly critical of officials and former colleagues i think it was a grand experiment and it had some very important successes and it was the right thing to do at the time , the former director said but that time is passed billie tsien , a principal in tod williams billie tsien architects , who was a bloomberg appointee from 2002 to 2003 , said the governor had made the corporation peripheral as long as he s running it , she said , it s hard to imagine they have a reason for being i went on the board because i thought it was a chance to make a positive contribution and a difference in new york city , ms tsien said and in the end , that did n't happen i would n't have said this until recently i 've tried essentially to be discreet but i feel like now it seems like an incredibly empty exercise after four years on the board , madelyn wils said she still saw a future for the corporation , which always served the really strong purpose of bringing together agencies in an effective manner whether the governor and the mayor have the wherewithal to have lmdc continue that work , she said , is not entirely clear
baghdad , iraq nearly two years after american troops captured baghdad , haifa street is like an arrow at the city s heart a little more than two miles long , it runs south through a canyon of mostly abandoned highrises and majestic date palms almost to the assassin s gate , the imperialstyle arch that is the main portal to the green zone compound , the principal seat of american power when most roads in central baghdad are choked with traffic , there is rarely more than a trickle of vehicles on haifa street at the day s height , a handful of pedestrians scurry down empty sidewalks , ducking into covered walkways that serve as sanctuaries from gunfire and as blinds for insurgent attacks in one of iraq s most bitterly contested battle zones american soldiers call the street purple heart boulevard the first battalion of the ninth cavalry , patrolling here for the past year before its recent rotation back to base at fort hood , tex , received more than 160 purple hearts many patrols were on foot , to gather intelligence on neighborhoods that american officers say have been the base for brutal car bombings , kidnappings and assassinations across baghdad in the first 18 months of the fighting , the insurgents mostly outmaneuvered the americans along haifa street , showing they could carry the war to the capital s core with something approaching impunity but american officers say there have been signs that the tide may be shifting on haifa street , at least , , insurgents are attacking in smaller numbers , and with less intensity mortar attacks into the green zone have diminished sharply major raids have uncovered large weapons caches and some rebel leaders have been arrested or killed american military engineers , frustrated elsewhere by insurgent attacks , are moving ahead along haifa street with a 20 million program to improve electricity , sewer and other utilities so far , none of the work sites have been attacked , although a local shiite leader who vocally supported the american projects was assassinated on his doorstep in january but the change american commanders see as more promising than any other here is the deployment of large numbers of iraqi troops american commanders are eager to shift the fighting in iraq to the country s own troops , allowing american units to pull back from the cities and , eventually , to begin drawing down their 150 , 000 troops haifa street has become an early test of that strategy last month , an iraqi brigade with two battalions garrisoned along haifa street became the first homegrown unit to take operational responsibility for any combat zone in iraq the two battalions can muster more than 2 , 000 soldiers , twice the size of the american cavalry battalion that has led most fighting along the street so far , american officers say , the iraqis have done well , withstanding insurgent attacks and conducting aggressive patrols and raids , without deserting in large numbers or hunkering down in their garrisons if haifa street is brought under control , it will be a major step toward restoring order in this city of five million , and will send a wider message that the insurgents can be matched , and beaten back still , american commanders are wary , saying the changes are a long way from a victory they note that the insurgents match each tactical change by the americans and iraqi government forces with their own we know that we face a learning enemy , just as we learn from him , said maj gen peter w chiarelli , who left baghdad recently after a year commanding the first cavalry division , responsible for overall security in baghdad and for the 800member task force dedicated to haifa street but i believe we are gaining the upper hand , he said a downturn in rebel fire for now , the days when rebels could gather in groups as large as 150 , pinning down american troops for as long as six hours at a time , have tapered off american officers say only three haifa street mortars have hit the green zone in the past six months in the last two weeks of september alone , 11 haifa street mortars hit the sprawling zone in recent weeks , with the new iraqi units on hand , the americans have sent up to 1 , 500 men at a time on sweeps , uncovering insurgent weapons caches and arresting insurgent leaders like ali mama , the name taken by a gangster who was once a favored hit man for saddam hussein he is now in abu ghraib others who have become local legends with attacks on the americans have been killed , including one who used the nomdeguerre ra'id the hunter , american intelligence officers say the two iraqi battalions , backed by a new battalion from the third infantry division , will now bear the main burden of establishing order in the sprawling district around haifa street three miles deep and about half as wide , encompassing about 170 , 000 people , the city s main railway yards , current and former government buildings , and the mansour melia hotel , favored by many westerners based in baghdad by any measure , it is a tough patch when mr hussein ordered baghdad s old walled city bulldozed in the 1980 s , he gave the street at its heart a new name , haifa , to honor the israeli port city that many arabs hope will become part of a palestinian state in the forest of new highrises , mr hussein housed thousands of loyalists baath party stalwarts , middleclass professionals from his favored sunni minority , migrants from his hometown , tikrit , and fugitives from other arab countries , including egypt , syria and sudan after baghdad fell on april 9 , 2003 , the area was primed to become an insurgent redoubt mr hussein established his first hideout somewhere along the alleyways of sheik marouf , a neighborhood that is still a rebel stronghold in some ways , haifa street is a microcosm of iraq behind the apartment blocks lie a patchwork of shiite communities where residents , repressed like other shiites under mr hussein , are mostly friendly to the americans interlaced with these are predominantly sunni neighborhoods that have been insurgent bases , like al sadr fahama sheik ali , a district of sheik marouf and the area along the tigris that mr hussein named for himself , saddamiya , where he attended school in the 1950 s the sunni neighborhoods , along with the area s arab migrants , proved a bountiful recruiting pool for the two principal groups that form the resistance prohussein loyalists who believe they can somehow restore baath party rule and militants loyal to abu musab alzarqawi , the jordanianborn militant who has spawned a web of terrorist groups and attracted a 25 million bounty as america s mostwanted man in iraq from their haifa street hideouts , the rebels have been remorseless american units report having found headless bodies in garbage dumps and floating in the river twelveyearold boys have thrown grenades sixyearolds have approached american patrols with whispers of insurgent hideouts , then lured them into ambushes a missing iraqi soldier s bloodied uniform turned up hanging from a wire near the river , with a sign in arabic pinned to it saying , let this be a warning for spies a year ago , the american cavalry division took a major risk in shifting to foot patrols from drivethroughs in bradley armored troop carriers the change took its toll the division s haifa street force lost five soldiers , and 25 were seriously wounded , the core of a wider group of injured men who received those purple hearts but the unit estimates that it killed 100 to 200 enemy fighters , and the yield in intelligence was rich with the foot patrols , the americans made friends in the shiite communities , particularly in showaka , a poor area where back streets are dotted with carved , ottomanera balconies ties improved with a special 2 million reconstruction program part of the wider reconstruction in the district that has brought 12 , 500 showaka families their first indoor toilets , buried sewage pipes and modernized the electricity grid gone , for these people , are the centuries when sewage ran down open channels in the alleys into the tigris american morale , for the moment , is high lt col thomas d macdonald , the cavalry division officer who commanded the haifa street task force , believes that the iraqis , with an affinity for their own people , can push the rebels farther back i 've got the enemy to the point where he ca n't do largescale operations anymore , only the smallscale stuff , he said recently , during one of his last patrols , at the head of a company of 120 soldiers if we put in more iraqi garrisons like this , that will be the final nail in the coffin iraqi units with 'heart' when iraqi units began to serve in combat zones , desertion rates were high during the first offensive in falluja , last april , some soldiers refused to fight but over the past nine months , a 5 billion americanfinanced effort has bought iraqi units more than 100 , 000 kalashnikov rifles , 100 , 000 flak jackets , 110 , 000 pistols , 6 , 000 cars and pickup trucks , and 230 million rounds of ammunition in place of the single iraqi battalion trained last june , there are more than 90 battalions now , totaling about 60 , 000 army and special police troops no one is certain how many insurgents they face the number , including foot soldiers , safehouse operators , organizers and financiers , is estimated to be 12 , 000 to 20 , 000 iraqi units still complain about unequal equipment , particularly the lack of the heavy armor the americans use , like bradley fighting vehicles and abrams tanks but the complaints among american officers about tiny heart syndrome a caustic reference to some iraqi units' unwillingness to expose themselves to combat have diminished now , they 're ready to fight , said lt gen david h petraeus , the american officer overseeing the retraining effort , in a recent interview at his green zone headquarters lethal intimidation of recruits the suicide bombing of army barracks , police stations and recruiting lines , with scores of volunteers killed remains the single biggest problem in building the iraqi forces , the general acknowledged but an overwhelming majority of new recruits have refused to buckle , he said , and they understand that they are fighting , not for the americans , but for their own country guys who get blown up in the morning get themselves bandaged up , and they 're back in the afternoon , he said the uncompromising image is one that gen muhammad alsamraa , 39 , the commander of the iraqi 303rd battalion , based on haifa street , is eager to push my aim is 100 percent clear all the terrorists living here , they go now , he said , in halting english he was a major in mr hussein s air defense force , and spent a year as a bodyguard and driver for a shiite tribal leader in baghdad before signing up for the new army a shiite himself , commanding a unit composed mostly of shiites , general samraa has made his headquarters in the old sajida palace , on the riverbank at haifa street s northern end , a sad , looted , sandbagged relic of the pleasure dome it was for mr hussein s first wife , sajida but the general insisted the new iraqi forces had history on their side saddam , we 've seen the movie , and it s finished , he said he s broken now is the new iraq among shiites , good will in the shiite neighborhoods of haifa street , the good will for americans is pervasive a fruit seller , majid hussein hassan , 40 , rose from his stall to ask colonel macdonald for help getting hospital treatment for an infant nephew with a heart deformity from a balcony , an old woman appealed for better garbage removal we 're counting on you americans , she said iraqi officials do nothing ! in showaka and other shiite neighborhoods , residents clustered around the americans , offering slivers of information about insurgents a man in the black cloak of a shiite religious student gave the names of a brother and sister from a sunni street who had left in haste after a bombing on the eve of the jan 30 elections that killed 17 people , including 6 children , in a shiite district of sheik marouf the sunni neighborhoods are another matter there , american and iraqi troops face continuing attacks from a mix of insurgents the hussein loyalists , baath party irreconcilables dreaming of restoring sunni rule , islamic militants under mr zarqawi , and criminal gangs that thrived under mr hussein for an overview of the area , colonel macdonald led a platoon to the roof of an apartment block roof overlooking tala'i square , notorious for a dec 19 attack when masked insurgents ambushed iraqi election officials , hauling them from their car and shooting them in the head with helicopters armed with missiles circling overhead , the colonel offered what sounded like a valedictory for the haifa street insurgents we 've gotten to the point where the bad guys really are n't fighting us here anymore , he said the battle is all in the back alleys now still , on the streets of sheik ali , the insurgents leave plenty of traces when an american patrol of 120 men passed through the nearly deserted streets at noon , the few residents who glanced through halfopened doors and curtains offered furtive smiles and waves but on the walls , the message was one of defiance death to the americans ! the slogans said , freshly painted after older ones were spray painted over by iraqi troops victory to the mujahedeen !
the mysteries of this mets season how jos reyes has stayed healthy , how kazuhisa ishii has stayed in the starting rotation , why david wright bats sixth have been trumped by one potentially historic curiosity carlos beltran spent the first half hitting home runs for pedro mart nez and practically no one else according to the elias sports bureau , beltran is on pace to become the first bigleague slugger to finish a season with doubledigit home runs and have more than 70 percent of them be hit in games pitched by the same starter as mart nez makes his first start of the second half today against the atlanta braves , he can count on beltran for a continuing pledge of support coming out of the allstar game break , beltran had 10 home runs , 9 of which were in games mart nez pitched beltran was batting 322 with 22 runs batted in on mart nez s start dates and 250 with 22 rbi in every other game combined he was basically mart nez s designated hitter , an allstar only every fifth day coaches called it all a coincidence statisticians called it a quirk asked about the preferential treatment he has received , mart nez giggled asked about the lopsided nature of his numbers , beltran shrugged his shoulders i ca n't explain it , he said i just think it s the grace of god beltran has indeed attributed his bond with mart nez to their group prayer sessions none of the experts have any more plausible explanations the odds are so far against this sort of thing , it s ridiculous , said randy robles , an elias statistician it s got to be an anomaly , a blip on the radar does beltran try harder because one guy s pitching \? i doubt it it s just very weird and very rare mart nez and beltran are truly in this cause together they joined the mets within a month of each other last offseason and beltran signed his contract in part because mart nez signed first on days mart nez pitches , beltran can hide in center field and hit in relative peace but when mart nez is n't on the mound , all of the attention shifts to beltran he has been much more effective when mart nez is out there with him , another superstar sharing the limelight and the diamond there may be something to that , but i think it s more simple , said dr allan lans , the psychologist who used to work with the mets when you have a pitcher the team has confidence in , everybody relaxes they think they 'll be in the ballgame and they 'll do better when pedro pitches , it s like , 'we 've got a chance to win' it s just easier to play on those days beltran might feel more comfortable when pedro is out there i certainly would the mets' offense has actually been more generous with starting pitcher kris benson but beltran has become a oneman support system for mart nez , almost like another member of his oversized entourage even though beltran is quieter and more polished than mart nez , they have built a connection that carries over from the clubhouse to the field putting mart nez on the mound and beltran at the plate has been an almost unbeatable combination when beltran hit a home run in the first half , the mets were 81 beltran s first homer came when mart nez pitched against the cincinnati reds on opening day his second came when the mets were 05 and mart nez was working on a completegame victory in atlanta beltran s first seven home runs of the season were all for mart nez , prompting laughter and confusion in the mets' clubhouse if you study this sort of data , you 'll find just about anything you want to see , said edward melnick , a statistics professor at new york university when you look at random events , like flipping a coin , you 'll get patterns and runs on the data i do n't think there s anything unusual going on at all still , mets starting pitcher tom glavine joked that he would wear mart nez s no 45 so beltran would hit for him manager willie randolph said he wished mart nez could pitch every day for beltran s benefit when beltran finally hit a home run for a different mets pitcher , mart nez playfully insisted that he was not jealous or angry the mets believe beltran is due for a breakthrough second half , and they are going to need him to muscle up for a variety of different starters in the first game of the second half , with benson pitching against the braves , beltran had four hits but no home runs in his final atbat , he sent a long drive to deep rightcenter field , and his teammates raced to the top step of the dugout to chart the course of the ball inevitably , it hit off the top of the fence and bounced back for a double i would have liked that one to go out , beltran said when it was suggested to him that the ball might have carried another couple of feet if only mart nez had been pitching , beltran rolled his eyes probably , he said
boston , oct 6 adam hyzdu returned to the clubhouse from a workout in fenway park on thursday and plopped onto the chair in front of his locker kicking off his size14 s , he found , to his surprise , a hole in one of his kneehigh red socks wide enough for four toes to pop out i knew they were thin , hyzdu said , laughing but i did n't know they were that thin that would also be a fitting assessment of his team s chances of repeating as world series champions after a heartrending 54 loss to the white sox on wednesday in game 2 of their american league division series , a game seemingly in their grasp , the tattered red sox will be hard pressed to stave off elimination against the team with the al s best record they must win their next three , starting with game 3 on friday at fenway park but despite their depleted pitching staff and a lineup that has scored in only 3 of 18 innings , there may be some elasticity left the red sox , quite simply , do not panic it is not in their current circuitry , nor in their heritage , to do so in 1999 , they clawed back from a twogamestonone deficit to defeat cleveland in the american league division series in 2003 , they overcame a 20 deficit to defeat oakland in the division series last season , they increased their degree of difficulty when they fell three games behind the yankees and were three outs from elimination in the championship series but they won four straight on their way to capturing their first world series title since 1918 all of those seriesclinching victories came on the road in their last nine postseason games facing elimination , red sox teams have won eight times there s always fight left in the sox , man , always , first baseman kevin millar said we do n't want to make a living like this , but for some reason we do the red sox are wobbling this time because of a devastatingly poor performance by their game 1 starter , matt clement , and partially because of a bucknerian gaffe in game 2 by second baseman tony graffanino , who let a likely doubleplay grounder roll through his legs two batters later , tadahito iguchi slammed a goahead threerun homer considering the circumstances , the plane ride late wednesday night to boston was an upbeat one , several red sox said , filled with players talking baseball , playing cards and laughing then again , this is a famously loose group , the selfanointed idiots it is a clubhouse where the hirsute center fielder johnny damon has a magnet reading mullets get chicks above his locker and david ortiz can conduct television interviews with his daughter alexandra using him as her personal jungle gym it is also a clubhouse crammed with regulars who have proved they can thrive in the most challenging situations the plane ride from oakland was a little more quiet , pitcher bronson arroyo said of that 2003 series with the athletics , and last year it was crazy because we had to win four but i think most of the guys here have been there and know what it takes to get the job done still , there is a creeping sense that this could be the last hurrah for their core group there are 11 holdovers from the 2003 team \( 12 if you count the injured gabe kapler \) , which kindled the flames of the current redsoxyankees saga and went on to lose in the championship series in seven games the feared slugger ortiz is certain to return , as is the captain and catcher , jason varitek but after that \? every winter , it seems , the red sox discuss unloading the mercurial cleanup hitter manny ramirez this may be the time it happens the red sox would love to keep damon , a free agent , but the asking price from his agent , scott boras , may be too high millar and the steady third baseman bill mueller are free agents , too , and the red sox may try to upgrade at their positions we do n't even think about that , millar said right now it s just baseball there will be plenty of time later on to think about business tomorrow we play , tomorrow we win , and then we get right back out there rain is in the forecast for the east coast this weekend it could disrupt playoff games here and in new york boston has a much better chance of getting in game 3 on friday afternoon than a possible game 4 on saturday afternoon , according to the penn state department of meteorology a rainout on saturday would benefit the red sox because their starting staff is so thin , down essentially to three reliable pitchers tim wakefield , who will go in game 3 curt schilling , who will start if there is a game 4 and david wells , who will pitch on four days' rest if a game 5 were played on monday instead of sunday if all that were to happen , the red sox would have the white sox right where they want them when your enemy s down , you got to keep him down , white sox manager ozzie guillen said you make some noise , you wake up the monster a green one , naturally
it was a lively and provocative thanksgiving gathering chez wine panel , where we recently sat down to an early feast and spirited debate over which were the best wines to serve with the bird and its table mates florence fabricant and i were joined by our colleagues frank bruni and julia moskin and by our tasting coordinator , bernard kirsch the assignment was for each of us to bring two wines , a red and a white the price limit was 30 a bottle then , with a meal of turkey , stuffing and the sort of sweet and savory side dishes typical of many holiday meals , we would sample the wines blind and decide which ones best deserved a place at the table simple , right \? yet , as with any group of family and friends , disagreements abounded consensus was rare , except in one unfortunate circumstance the others agreed that the wines i brought were pitiful now , that s a harsh word , but i think it accurately depicts their attitude of dismissal i bring this up not to be defensive , but because , if you want to know the truth , my wines were fabulous ! first of all , i jettisoned the 30 limit , which might be fine for an intimate gathering but is way too expensive for dinners of 30 to 35 people , the numbers at my family s thanksgiving i held the line at 20 , selecting a dry 2003 austrian riesling from hirsch , whose wines i love , for 19 , and a lightly fruity 2004 juli \? s , also 19 , from michel t \? , one of my favorite beaujolais producers even though the tasting was blind , i could identify my wines right away the minerally , almost gravelly riesling was unmistakable the flavors were persistent , the texture lovely , and at 12 percent alcohol , it s a wine you can drink throughout a long meal the juli \? s was just delicious lively and balanced with flavors that kept bringing me back at 13 percent alcohol , it too would not go to the head too quickly and yet the others jeered well , they were too polite to be rude , but i could tell what they were thinking i believe it was julia who first used the word watery in regard to the riesling , but the others quickly piled on too thin , not enough body , they said at one point the term banal came up the snobs ! moving on to the juli \? s , the theme was sour and astringent talk about a thanksgiving smackdown , frank chortled thanks , frank , we 'll get to your wines soon but first , why such discord \? is it possible that the riesling and the beaujolais were not able to stand up to a dish as unassertive as turkey \? i do n't think so we did have a sweet potato concoction as cloying as cotton candy , but a dish like that probably goes best with a coke i think my wines were lighter bodied and less sweet than some of the others on the table compared with those , whose higher alcohol and bigger body at least gave more of an impression of sweetness , drinking my wines was a little like tasting orange juice after brushing your teeth at least , that was my interpretation yet with wine , it always bears repeating that every palate is different even among the most venerated experts , tenaciously held opinions collide though wines often achieve greatness only insofar as they are distinctive , with a large gathering , as with politics and bureaucracies , an inoffensive middle road is sometimes the surest route to success not that our top wines were insipid they were rather excellent examples of widely popular styles julia and florence both adhere to the belief that the wines on the thanksgiving table ought to be american i have no problem with that , especially when the white is a sauvignon blanc as fine as julia s 2004 merry edwards from the russian river valley we all loved the complexity of this wine it combined a sort of full , musky aroma with a classic , lean and piercing sauvignon blanc character at 139 percent , it was the highest in alcohol of the whites , yet not too bad at all , though at 27 it is a little expensive for a crowd unfortunately , julia obtained this bottle directly from the winery on a recent trip to california , and merry edwards is now sold out of the 2004 still , the bottle demonstrates the versatility of sauvignon blanc at the table luckily there are many good , inexpensive examples available from california , france , new zealand , south africa and south america for her red , julia chose a 2004 siduri pinot noir from sonoma county she loved its smoothness and what she described as a tobacco flavor for the rest of us , it seemed like a safe choice that would please a crowd superficial , but with a little too much oak and sweetness or , as frank put it , it s like a piece of velvet that was meant to be a throw pillow but was never stuffed indeed while i hate to make a fetish of alcohol content , at 147 percent this wine was on the high side to be served at a long and sometimes fatiguing meal that often requires a long car trip this is the chief reason i do n't consider zinfandel , once a reflexive choice far too often its alcohol level is above 15 percent florence also chose a pinot noir , a wellbalanced 2003 from j vineyards in the russian river valley we all agreed that it had a presence and complexity that the siduri lacked , and was juicy without being sweet it had a slightly lower alcohol content than the siduri , but was more expensive , 27 to 20 for her white , florence made a bold choice , a dry 2004 central coast gew \? raminer from claiborne churchill a good gew \? is a singularly exotic thing , and california gew \? raminers are often underrated yet you have to pick your spots with them while we all enjoyed this wine , we agreed that it would be hard to drink throughout the meal all litchi , all the time , julia said even florence , as much as she liked the wine , felt it could be overpowering
washington , march 8 federal investigators examining the fatal crash of a staten island ferry in 2003 issued a damning assessment tuesday of the new york city department of transportation , saying its oversight of the second busiest ferry system in the country was compromised by inadequate training and the nearly nonexistent enforcement of basic safety rules the national transportation safety board , which took 16 months to investigate the crash , was unsparing in its criticism of the city s management of the ferries , and depicted its operation as beset by an almost reckless lack of proper procedures where risk can lead to catastrophic loss of life , there is little room for such complacency , the safety board s chairwoman , ellen engleman conners , said after a threehour board meeting no matter your safety record , no matter how many years of operations , safety must be job no 1 the board also criticized the united states coast guard , which oversees the licensing of the ferry pilots who operate in new york harbor , saying it failed to ensure that the pilot in the new york crash was medically fit to perform his duties , and that its broader effort to monitor the health and ability of ferry pilots in new york and elsewhere was inadequate on oct 15 , 2003 , the ferry andrew j barberi , cruising at full speed , struck a maintenance pier near the st george terminal on staten island , killing 11 passengers and injuring 70 others it was the first deadly accident in the history of the ferry operation , which began in 1905 and has an annual ridership of 19 million , second only to the washington state ferry system the crash set off a criminal investigation that led to charges against four city employees , including manslaughter charges against the assistant captain who lost control of the ferry and the city s director of ferry operations it also resulted in 191 civil lawsuits , totaling more than 33 billion in claims the city comptroller , william c thompson jr , announced tuesday that 66 of the cases have been settled for a total of 24 million none of the settlements involved the 11 fatalities the report by the safety board , an independent federal panel , echoed many of the findings of an independent report on the city s ferry operation by the global maritime and transportation school the city hired the school , part of the united states merchant marine academy , to review the operations of the ferry system , and it has adopted many of the school s recommendations for improving safety , made in february 2004 oct 15 , 2003 , was one of the darkest and saddest days of my tenure as the commissioner of the new york city department of transportation , commissioner iris weinshall said after the meeting tuesday though , like any mass transit system , we are not immune to safety problems , we have a safety record of which i am very proud but this history cannot undo the tragedy that occurred nearly 17 months ago by october , she said , the department will have hired 95 additional ferry employees and installed new navigational and communications devices on all vessels the board s report acknowledged the city s steps toward improvement , but was stinging nonetheless it faulted everything from the lack of firstaid training among ferry workers to the absence of a formal , comprehensive safety management system additionally , the board said that ferry officials had not made sure that the eight pages of established procedures for ferry employees were distributed or even read , and that training for workers was provided other than on the job the board formally expanded the scope of its criticism to include the coast guard , which had not come under serious scrutiny in the aftermath of the accident the report found fault with the coast guard s less than rigorous system for screening and overseeing the health of the pilots it licensed , and used the case of the barberi s pilot to underscore its shortcomings the board , which said the 2003 crash was caused by the unexplained incapacitation of the pilot , richard j smith , noted that he had suffered from a variety of ailments hypertension , insomnia and back pain among them and was taking medication for some or all of them little if any of this was known to the coast guard , which had granted mr smith his license the coast guard , the board found , had not required mr smith to notify it of changes in his physical condition or drug regimen the coast guard requires annual physical examinations of each mariner , but the board said that its program allowed for doctor shopping by mariners with health problems who might want to keep their ailments secret mr smith , who attempted suicide immediately after the crash , pleaded guilty to manslaughter last august but has not been sentenced his physician , william tursi , is to be tried in june for lying to officials about mr smith s medical condition dr mitchell a garber , the medical officer in the safety board s investigation , said that even if mr smith s health problems had been disclosed , they might not have prevented him from serving as a ferry pilot because the coast guard leaves the certification of mariners to regional evaluation centers that have widely varying standards , he said , we have some concern that had these things been revealed , the individual might have received certification nonetheless dr garber was critical as well of the coast guard s haphazard system of recording information about mariners , saying it lacked anything as formal as a searchable database a spokeswoman for the coast guard said it could not comment on any of the board s findings and recommendations until its commanders had read the full report we 're reviewing the recommendations right now , the spokeswoman , jolie shifflet , said she said the coast guard , which is responsible for granting credentials to hundreds of ferry pilots across the country , had records on 220 , 000 mariners , although many of them might not be active the investigation did make one finding that could play a role in the federal prosecution of the director of ferry operations , patrick ryan , who is to be tried next month on manslaughter charges the government has asserted that the city neglected for decades to enforce a rule requiring two people to be in a ferry s pilothouse at all times only mr smith , the assistant captain , was at the controls at the time of the crash the safety board found that the captain , michael j gansas , had contributed to the accident when he failed to exercise his command responsibilities but the board concluded in its report that the twopilot rule was not clear the particular procedure was open to a variety of interpretations on the part of ferry supervisors and on the part of ferry crew members themselves , said barry strauch , an official in the safety board s office of marine safety ms conners , the board s chairwoman , said , there was great interpretation of what the rule was or was not , how it was implemented and how it was disseminated a spokesman for the united states attorney in brooklyn , who is prosecuting the case , said he could not comment on the findings the board even criticized the ferry crew s response after the crash rob jones , a board employee , described the response to the crash as chaotic at no time during the accident did anyone take overall command , he said and the board s vice chairman , mark v rosenker , said , i am still kind of surprised about the lack of training in any way , shape or form in basic first aid for crew members
when billy beane , the general manager of the oakland a s , traded the team s two most popular pitchers last december , fans howled in disgust a month later , mr beane gave a lengthy interview to athletics nation , a web log devoted to the team , explaining the deals afterward , the site s moderator , tyler bleszinski , polled his readers , asking if they now approved of mr beane s trades fully 93 percent said yes mr beane , the central figure in michael lewis s 2004 book moneyball , had given interviews to the site before the reason why i would opt to go do the interviews with them is that it s been a great forum to get the actual message across rather than having it filtered through someone else , mr beane said there may be seven newspaper reporters covering one team , and they may be more interested in covering something first than covering something right athletics nation \( www athleticsnation com \) is the flagship property of sportsblogs , a series of sports web sites that is the brainchild of markos moulitsas zuniga , the founder of the leftleaning political blog daily kos \( www dailykos com \) daily kos , which mr moulitsas began in 2002 , has succeeded in part because the site allows readers not only to respond to postings but also to start their own interactive diaries after achieving enough success with kos that he says he is able to live in costly berkeley , calif , entirely off its ad revenue , mr moulitsas , 33 , began to think about how the structure of the site could easily extend beyond politics i realized that blogs were really effective for partisan audiences one of them is sports sports is huge where you 've got your red sox and yankees situation and religion is another , said mr moulitsas but in religion , people kill each other , so i decided i 'd rather stay away from religion sportsblogs is not the first case of an individual trying to branch out into ownership of a series of blogs over the last couple of years , nick denton has been gradually constructing his gawker media network , making waves every few months by starting new blogs tackling issues like new york gossip , pornography , tech gadgets , cars and more but mr moulitsas said he thought sportsblogs was a different kind of blog network there are some parallels to other blog series , he said but none of them are building community at the end of the day , our company is going to sink or swim on how well we can build community in late 2003 , mr moulitsas convinced mr bleszinski , who also works in public relations but who had long wanted to write about the a s , to start athletics nation to see if a baseball blog modeled on the structure of daily kos would click the site soon attracted an audience of more than 10 , 000 unique visitors daily when i saw how successful athletics nation had become , it confirmed that there really was a market out there , mr moulitsas said tyler had no idea he was my guinea pig the two men , along with three partners , began scouting for writers they felt could create and maintain respectable sports blogs before long , they had recruited 17 writers , each of whom entered into an agreement under which sportsblogs own the 17 sites but splits the ad revenue right now , they are all baseball , but we 're eager to expand to all the big sports , said mr moulitsas we want to do stuff like nascar , tennis and cycling but these things do n't grow on trees you have to build them getting sportsblogs started took an investment of about 20 , 000 , most of which came from daily kos profits and because each new site has low setup costs , pressure on the writers to reach specific traffic or revenue milestones is minimal still , sportsblogs sites such as minor league ball , lookout landing \( for seattle mariners fans \) , mccovey chronicles \( san francisco giants \) , pinstripe alley \( yankees \) and amazin' avenue \( mets \) are thriving minor league ball , for example , gets about 3 , 000 unique visitors daily according to mr moulitsas , the sportsblogs sites are currently bringing in just under 3 , 000 in revenue a month in total but the sites are only a couple of months old , and he said that no significant revenue was projected until summer the fact that we have any income right now is shocking to me , he said and while some newspaper sportswriters might worry that those blog visitors come at their expense , others said that they felt there was nothing to fear i think they 're coming at it from a completely different point of view , which i think is great , said susan slusser , who writes about the a s for the san francisco chronicle they 've got the fan viewpoint , first and foremost , and they can be slanted , and they can be emotional , which is not what the beat writers are doing of course , some might argue that such blogs are essentially mouthpieces for teams like the a s , but mr bleszinski argues there s nothing wrong with that i'm a fan , he said i never claimed to be anything more than a fan anybody who comes there to read an unbiased opinion , they 're at the wrong site
los alamos , nm , nov 11 rushing to evacuate her home as a forest fire lapped at the edges of this highdesert town in may 2000 , kathryn gursky took with her just one book , a british edition of the world of pooh , by a a milne , bought when she and her husband were vacationing in dorset some 11 years earlier when she returned to los alamos after the fire , ms gursky , a 49yearold former librarian , found that the rest of her 2 , 300volume personal library had burned , along with her house and everything in it thousands of scorched tree trunks still range up the hillside across the street from ms gursky s new home here , but inside the house , her library is well on the way to recovery in september , ms gursky received a birthday gift from her husband that earned her the envy of her bookloving friends the complete collection of the penguin classics library , 1 , 082 books sold only by amazoncom for nearly 8 , 000 penguin classics , the paperback volumes with the familiar black spine and the orange and black penguin logo , are known to generations of former students who struggled through dickens and dozed through henry james in school while plenty of competitors also sell collections of classics , including random house \( modern library , everyman s library and bantam classics \) , oxford university press \( world classics \) , the library of america and barnes noble , arguably none is as instantly recognizable or as renowned as the penguin classics it s hard to think of a rival , said harold bloom , the author , professor and literary critic who extolled his love of literature in the western canon and how to read and why the penguin collection has enormous range and comprehensiveness not since penguin started the collection in 1946 , however , has anyone been able to easily compile or purchase a complete set of the books , which range from ancient greek poetry to the novels of thomas pynchon and include the complete works of shakespeare , four translations of the iliad , 20 volumes each of the works of henry james and dickens \( the complete list can be found at www amazon com by searching for penguin classics library \) we 'd always wanted to sell them together , but it was always an issue of how could we sell all of the books in a single bookstore , said tim mccall , penguin s director of online sales and marketing , noting that most bookstores carry only a few hundred titles in the series finally the internet became mature enough to give us the ability to display all the books and to reach an audience out there that might want them ms gursky s collection arrived in midseptember packed in 25 boxes , shrinkwrapped on a pallet and weighing nearly 700 pounds since then , ms gursky has spent countless hours unpacking , shelving , categorizing , alphabetizing and rearranging the books oh , yes and reading she said she had completed more than 30 of the books in the last eight weeks even at that rather remarkable pace , it would take her about six years to make her way through the entire collection so where did she start \? i ran my finger along the shelves , closed my eyes and stopped on one , ms gursky said , sitting in an overstuffed chair in her new library , 31 rows of great literature looming behind her she picked herland , a feminist utopian novel by charlotte perkins gilman , a greatniece of harriet beecher stowe , combined in one penguin volume with gilman s short fiction and poetry i had never heard of her before , ms gursky said but that is one of the joys of this collection it takes you places where you would n't have otherwise gone since then , by similarly traipsing along the edge of her bookshelves or by following a reference to one classic made in the introduction to another , ms gursky has wound her way through the adventures and memoirs of sherlock holmes and three other books by sir arthur conan doyle soon to follow were vineland by thomas pynchon \( boy , that was weird , she said \) and the virginian by owen wister she picked up the riddle of the sands , by erskine childers , which she said she had listened to hundreds of times on tape but had never seen in print , but noticed that near childers on the shelf were four books by kate chopin , who was unfamiliar , so ms gursky started on chopin s bayou folk and a night in acadie despite its daunting scope , the penguin classics complete collection is not actually complete penguin lists some 1 , 300 titles in its catalog but included only 1 , 082 in the amazon collection we included every title in stock at sufficient levels to ensure the continued availability of the collection , mr mccall explained in the final analysis , there were approximately 200 titles that did not make the cut due to limited availability , most often because they were on our schedule to be completely revised amazon will not say how many sets have been sold so far or who has bought them , citing the need to protect the buyers' privacy penguin seems not to know who the buyers are other than ms gursky , who acknowledged her ownership in a review of the collection on amazon s web site mr mccall said that penguin has shipped one to two sets a week to amazon since it began selling the collection in midjune assuming that amazon has been shipping those copies to customers , rather than piling them up in its warehouse , that would put sales at more than two dozen for mr bloom , the classics scholar , the idea that anyone whether committed readers or libraries would pony up for such a collection is admirable especially at this time , he added , when serious reading is an ebbing current in the englishspeaking world put ms gursky in the seriousreading camp i probably had already read 20 to 25 percent of the books on the list at some point , ms gursky said but i like to reread books , and i like to own books i can go back and reread ms gursky earned a master s degree in library science at the university of chicago before returning to los alamos , her hometown , and shortly thereafter got a job as a librarian at the los alamos national laboratory , where her husband , richard bolton , is a physicist she now works in database support for the laboratory we do n't own a tv set , ms gursky said , by way of explaining how she has had time to read a new book roughly every two days since the collection arrived with four cats but no children , we do n't have anything better to do than read , she said the penguin collection has evoked much discussion online , including on amazon s site , where some people have opined that it is hardly worth the expense for paperback books , whose pages will yellow and whose bindings are less sturdy than those of hardcovers the collection also has detractors who cite its literary shortcomings plenty of henry james and other books in the public domain , but none of the greatest works of faulkner or hemingway , for example , to which penguin does not own the copyright ms gursky discounts those arguments , particularly the paperback one , noting that a collection of 1 , 082 hardcovers would have been prohibitively expensive as it is , amazon s price of 7 , 98950 for the collection is discounted by 40 percent \( plus free shipping \) from a list price of 13 , 31584 i do n't sneer at paperbacks , she said they 'll outlast me , and that s really all i care about
matt bai s article \( nov 13 \) was crackling smart , just what i have come to expect regularly from this refreshingly original political writer he comes the closest i 've yet seen to pointing out the true limitation of hollywood liberalism that none of these wealthy , charismatic people are actually willing to do the dirty work of running for and holding political office while their conservative counterparts are from fred grandy to sonny bono to schwarzenegger to reagan , it s always the rightwing entertainers who decide they want to make policy instead of just complaining about it that s why , although i happen to share his political bent , i'm disgusted when rob reiner tries to compare senatorial responsibilities with his own making a hard decision about film locations is not the same as making a hard decision about social security politics may be show business for ugly people , as the old saying goes , but that s because politics is much uglier and riskier than show business joan hilty brooklyn photos \( left dan winters right collier schorr \)
los angeles shortly before the first onstage rehearsal for the los angeles opera s production of jacques offenbach s grand duchess , its director handed out thick packets labeled revisions the singers groaned the opera had been good enough for 138 years did it really need lastminute changes \? but when they opened the handouts , the performers brightened on page 2 , in oneinch type , were the words just kidding the other pages were blank i was totally fooled , said the mezzosoprano frederica von stade , who is singing the title role it was a great gag which , after all , is what you would expect when the director of your opera is the guy best known for creating laverne and shirley yes , the grand duchess \( la grandeduchesse de g rolstein \) is being brought to life by none other than garry marshall , who also directed the films pretty woman and the princess diaries this is his first foray into opera , and it is quite a grand debut , the kickoff of the company s lavish 20thanniversary celebration mr marshall s penchant for punch lines emerged long before rehearsals got under way he created nonsinging parts for four actoracrobats trained in clown school , and invented a canine sidekick for ms von stade named morrie , whose costume changes are as numerous and elaborate as the star s during auditions for the part of wanda , mr marshall asked singers if they could perform with a lisp why would i want to \? one outraged soprano demanded she did not get the part constance hauman , who has sung leading roles at covent garden and the new york city opera , was more resourceful lateral lisp or frontal lisp \? she asked , then she demonstrated her proficiency at both she was swiftly welcomed into the cast and though the music will be sung in french , as written , mr marshall has recast all the spoken passages in english , in a tone that closely resembles a sitcom but the results may have made the operetta about a jaded , mancrazy duchess who starts a war to relieve her boredom more faithful to the composer s original satiric intent offenbach was criticizing the very society he entertained , for its vanities , its frivolities and for the way that its leaders abused their power , said emmanuel villaume , the conductor and because it is an operetta , he said , if the spoken dialogue does n't work if it is n't funny then the musical numbers do n't work mr marshall is far from the first entertainment industry veteran to try his hand at opera , though he may be the first mork and mindy writer to do so since the 1990 s , the tenor pl cido domingo , the general director of the los angeles opera , has sought , he said , to take advantage of our proximity to the film industry s great creative minds he and mr marshall , whose wife has supported the company for years , first met at a performance against a backdrop of galas and fundraisers , their friendship deepened , until one day mr domingo asked him an unexpected question would he like to direct \? mr domingo had a specific opera in mind i knew 'la grandeduchesse' would be the perfect vehicle for garry s comic talents , he said , especially if he agreed to adapt and update the english dialogue mr domingo had also lined up ms von stade for the title role as mr marshall left that night , he told his wife about the offer you should absolutely do it , she urged you 'll appreciate opera more but mr marshall was not yet convinced as a child in the bronx , he did n't grow up humming che gelida manina from la boh me his italian grandmother his family name was originally masciarelli loved opera , but he heard only the occasional radio broadcast in the late 1960 s , however , when he wanted to persuade tony randall , a famous opera lover , to appear in the television series the odd couple , he boned up on the subject and after mr randall accepted the part , mr marshall wrote episodes for guest stars from the opera world , including marilyn horne and martina arroyo he furthered his education while working on frankie and johnny , which the playwright terrence mcnally adapted for the screen himself in fact it was through mr mcnally that he met ms von stade \( or flicka , as friends call her \) , backstage at the san francisco opera premiere of jake heggie s dead man walking , for which mr mcnally wrote the libretto the meeting was a mutual admiration fest do n't move , mr marshall recalls ms von stade saying then she got her two daughters and said , they love you ultimately , it was ms von stade , mr marshall says , who inspired him to accept mr domingo s invitation when you 're considering doing an opera , the process is the same as when you 're thinking about doing a movie , he said you meet the star and sit around and see if you can possibly get along and she s funny , flicka to do a comedy opera , you have to have a star who s willing to be funny but in one big way , movies and opera are not alike the budget for 'the grand duchess' was 2 million , mr marshall said the budget for 'runaway bride' was 72 million mr marshall reads neither french nor music , so he studied english translations of the libretto , biographies of offenbach \( who , like mr marshall , enjoyed enormous success through comedy but yearned to be taken seriously \) and histories of europe on the eve of the francoprussian war offenbach , he learned , had written a happy ending to the work , but after his death , interpreters added a malicious twist mr marshall , who has virtually trademarked the fairytale finish , promptly restored the original yet this was not enough , he felt , to make the work his own we did n't want to make it 'modern' or do something with puppets , he said so we took an 'our town' narrator approach this meant introducing offenbach as a character one who interacts with the cast , grumbles about his inept interpreters and at one point ascends the podium to wrestle with mr villaume for control of the orchestra rehearsals began the second week in august on day 2 , the grand duchess looked more like a circus than an opera , spread out in two practice rooms on the fourth floor of the dorothy chandler pavilion in the bigger room , which resembled a basketball court , mr marshall , mr villaume , a piano accompanist and assorted cast members struggled to make their way through act i , while messengers , assistants and the members of mr marshall s design team drifted in and out but when ms von stade , casually turned out in a denim skirt , delivered her first aria , the sound of her voice froze everyone in place ms von stade is famous for not behaving like a diva , but she did bring her tiny west highland terrier , hannah , to rehearsal when she tenderly serenaded a stuffed standin for morrie , hannah , locked in a case , stared in outrage each day , as the singers' comic timing improved and their blocking shaped up , mr marshall got to know his cast he took them out to lunch or dinner , one by one with the tenor paul groves , who plays fritz , he discussed louisiana , where mr groves grew up and still maintains a house with ms hauman he discussed their shared alma mater everybody at northwestern knows garry marshall , ms hauman said he donated , like , the entire campus it wasstrategy , of course any time you 're the new kid in town , mr marshall said , you have to win people over in mr marshall s view , opera s biggest challenges are pace and logistics , which , given the size of a typical chorus , might better be termed crowd control pace involves ensuring that the performance does n't drag but it also means refining a long script in a short time five weeks , far less than the time allotted to rehearse a broadway play yet mr marshall was so organized , he stayed ahead of schedule that won him some leeway with the cast when he proposed trims in a profoundly undivalike gesture , ms von stade herself suggested losing a verse from her big solo , known as the meditation but mr marshall was careful not to excise too much the audience , he said , is paying to see flicka because mr marshall does not speak french , he relies on mr villaume , who is french , and his assistant director , michael phillips , also fluent , to advise singers on pronunciation and timing this is important , ms von stade said , because a lot of the alliance between word and music is very specific to the language mr marshall does , however , tell performers what to do when they 're singing , and he has been known to highlight mistakes with a joke but never a cruel one if anything really needs improvement , ms hauman said , he will make the suggestion in private mr villaume said garry is incredibly good at using the unique possibilities of singers and altering his staging and dialogue to accommodate them and there are quite a few to accommodate the cast alone is 80 people 16 dancers , 4 actoracrobats , 12 principals and a 48member chorus the opera motto is , it will be done in time to open , mr marshall said but that does n't work in comedy you have to test the jokes in front of an audience to see if they are funny so he decided to have a dry run but aside from the fact that opera does not usually use focus groups , union rules forbid unofficial performances in front of more than 50 people to obtain permission , mr marshall had to petition the local chapter , which had to petition its national leadership , which had to vote mr marshall won on aug 24 , the curtain rose on the runthrough or as mr marshall put it , stumblethrough he stood before an audience of cast members' families , friends and other guests , chatting them up as a professional comic warms up the crowd before a sitcom taping everybody please turn off your cellphones , he concluded , except those who have sprint they do n't work anyway his timing was so good that marc stern , the chairman of the los angeles opera , wondered aloud , do you think we could get him to do a monologue opening night \? ms hauman s lisp got a big guffaw when she talked about the myth of sisyphus , cast members shielded themselves with an umbrella the audience also chortled at ms von stade she is a kind of stately , elegant woman in real life , mr marshall said to be funny , she had to play against that in act i , she apes the baby talk spoken by a campfollowing trollop and despite its lavishness , her sedan chair confers no dignity she makes her entrance in it snoozing when tapped awake , she sputters , quickly , hide ! as if she needed to conceal an illicit lover the actors are not hard of hearing , mr marshall said they heard where they got laughs so they know i'm not cutting the parts where they were great the stumblethrough also marked the first time mr marshall had dealt in person with the 48member chorus , a challenge , he realized , he had not adequately met all those people on the stage are bunched up , his wife told him honey , he assured her i'm unbunching them but most of the audience did not seem to notice they walked out smiling , quoting lines mr marshall is not superstitious he was born on nov 13 , and for him , the number has been lucky on opening night , he plans to watch the show standing near portal 13 of course , i'm anxious , i'm nervous , he said of his impending opening but he s hopeful in july , mr marshall said his thoughts on opera could be summed up in words richard gere spoke to julia roberts in pretty woman people s reaction to opera the first time they hear it is extreme , mr gere says they either love it or they hate it if they love , they will always love it if they do n't , they may learn to love it , but it will never become part of their soul but after working on the grand duchess , he has reconsidered the jury is still out on soul , ' he said i would n't choose

with less than two weeks before the democratic mayoral primary , al sharpton and dennis rivera , leader of the influential health care workers' union , 1199 seiu , are weighing whether to endorse fernando ferrer or skip an endorsement in the primary altogether they are set to discuss the issue early next week , associates of both men say , noting that a lateinning joint endorsement could significantly alter the dynamics of the contest the associates , who spoke on condition of anonymity because the endorsement process is private , emphasized that mr rivera and mr sharpton have spoken only informally about endorsing mr ferrer and that they were still concerned that he has not proved he has a political message that can oust mayor michael r bloomberg in 2001 , mr sharpton endorsed mr ferrer s candidacy at the end of august , after a complex and sometimes testy monthslong dance at the time , mr sharpton brought a rush of excitement to the campaign along with a coalition of black leaders who have now split their support mainly between mr ferrer and c virginia fields , the only africanamerican in the race that momentum helped set the stage for mr rivera , who held out his endorsement until a week before the primary , when mr ferrer s standing in polls had begun to rise , indicating that he could win this time around , the men are weighing a joint endorsement amid questions of if , rather than when , they would make the announcement , a sign that they may be uncertain that either one alone can push mr ferrer over the top it also raises the possibility that mr ferrer , after appearing stuck with insufficient support to reach the critical 40 percent needed to avoid a runoff , could again have an 11thhour surge just yesterday , he received the endorsement of acorn , an advocacy group for lowincome families , amid cheering and chants of fernando and si , se puede \( yes , we can \) and throughout the day , he displayed a fiery new energy reminiscent of his 2001 campaign , putting aside his carefully designed role as an advocate for the middle class and speaking more forcefully on behalf of the city s poorer residents we had a mayor who said he did n't know anybody who made the minimum wage or did n't think too many people made it , he said of mayor bloomberg in accepting acorn s endorsement in front of city hall well , he does n't know the people we know , and he does n't see the people we see answering a reporter s question , he said , a crisis of affordability that squeezes the middle class is not only bad news for the middle class , it s even worse news for the working class and the poor who only want to work their way into the middle class c virginia fields received a boost yesterday in the form of a frontpage endorsement from the amsterdam news , which said she has been a hardworking , articulate spokesperson for the people of manhattan the endorsement also said she has done much to bring the black and jewish communities of her borough together , often withstanding anger and criticism from both sides of that divide ms fields also received the backing yesterday of religious leaders at a news conference near 1 police plaza the rev timothy i mitchell , associate pastor of the 500member ebenezer baptist church in flushing , praised ms fields s compassion , ideas and strong faith calling the other candidates honorable , mr mitchell added none of them can compare to the genuineness of virginia fields she does n't talk about it , she s about it gifford miller , the city council speaker , spent the morning campaigning at several bronx centers for the elderly he also appeared at the kingsbridge armory site in the bronx to call for construction of more public schools there to relieve overcrowding in that school district
i am saying that if anyone was involved in that type of activity which i referred to , they would not be working here ron ziegler , press secretary to richard nixon , defending the presidential aide dwight chapin on oct18 , 1972 chapin was convicted in april 1974 of perjury in connection with his relationship to the political saboteur donald segretti any individual who works here at the white house has the confidence of the president they would n't be working here at the white house if they did n't have the president s confidence scott mcclellan , press secretary to george w bush , defending karl rove on tuesday well , of course , karl rove did it he may not have violated the intelligence identities protection act of 1982 , with its high threshold of criminality for outing a covert agent , but there s no doubt he trashed joseph wilson and valerie plame we know this not only because of matt cooper s email , but also because of mr rove s own history trashing is in his nature , and bad things happen , usually through undertheradar whispers , to decent people \( and their wives \) who get in his way in the 2000 south carolina primary , john mccain s wife , cindy , was rumored to be a drug addict \( and senator mccain was rumored to be mentally unstable \) in the 1994 texas governor s race , ann richards found herself rumored to be a lesbian the implication that mr wilson was a john kerryish girlie man beholden to his wife for his meal ticket is of a thematic piece with previous mud splattered on rove political adversaries the difference is that this time mr rove got caught even so , we should n't get hung up on him or on most of the other supposed leading figures in this scandal thus far not matt cooper or judy miller or the wilsons or the bad guy everyone loves to hate , the former cnn star robert novak this scandal is not about them in the end , any more than watergate was about dwight chapin and donald segretti or woodward and bernstein it is about the president of the united states it is about a plot that was hatched at the top of the administration and in which everyone else , mr rove included , are at most secondary players to see the main plot , you must sweep away the subplots , starting with the cooper email it has been brandished as a smoking gun by bush bashers and as exculpatory evidence by bush backers \( mr rove , you see , was just trying to ensure that time had its facts straight \) but no one knows what this email means unless it s set against the avalanche of other evidence , most of it secret , including what mr rove said in three appearances before the grand jury therein lies the rub , or at least whatever case might be made for perjury another bogus subplot , long popular on the left , has it that patrick fitzgerald , the special prosecutor , gave mr novak a free pass out of ideological comradeship but mr fitzgerald , both young \( 44 \) and ambitious , has no record of starr or ashcroftstyle partisanship \( his contempt for the press notwithstanding \) or known proclivity for committing career suicide what s most likely is that mr novak , more of a common coward than the prince of darkness he fashions himself to be , found a way to spill some beans and avoid judy miller s fate that the investigation has dragged on so long anyway is another indication of the expanded reach of the prosecutorial web apparently this is finally beginning to dawn on mr bush s fiercest defenders and on mr bush himself hence , last week s erection of the stonewall manned by the almost poignantly clownish mr mcclellan , who abruptly rendered inoperative his previous statements that any suspicions about mr rove are totally ridiculous the morning after mr mcclellan went mano a mano with his tormentors in the white house press room we 've secretly replaced the white house press corps with actual reporters , observed jon stewart the ardently probush new york post ran only five paragraphs of a wireservice story on page 12 that conspicuous burial of what was frontpage news beyond murdochland speaks loudly about the rising anxiety on the right since then , white house surrogates have been desperately babbling talking points attacking joseph wilson as a partisan and a liar these attacks , too , are red herrings let me reiterate this case is not about joseph wilson he is , in alfred hitchcock s parlance , a macguffin , which , to quote the oxford english dictionary , is a particular event , object , factor , etc , initially presented as being of great significance to the story , but often having little actual importance for the plot as it develops mr wilson , his mission to niger to check out saddam s supposed attempts to secure uranium that might be used in nuclear weapons and even his wife s outing have as much to do with the real story here as janet leigh s theft of office cash has to do with the mayhem that ensues at the bates motel in psycho this case is about iraq , not niger the real victims are the american people , not the wilsons the real culprit the big enchilada , to borrow a 1973 john ehrlichman phrase from the nixon tapes is not mr rove but the gang that sent american sons and daughters to war on trumpedup grounds and in so doing diverted finite resources , human and otherwise , from fighting the terrorists who attacked us on 9 11 that s why the stakes are so high this scandal is about the unmasking of an illconceived war , not the unmasking of a cia operative who posed for vanity fair so put aside mr wilson s february 2002 trip to africa the plot that matters starts a month later , in march , and its omniscient author is dick cheney it was mr cheney \( on cnn \) who planted the idea that saddam was actively pursuing nuclear weapons at this time the vice president went on to repeat this charge in may on meet the press , in three speeches in august and on meet the press yet again in september along the way the frightening word uranium was thrown into the mix by september the president was bandying about the uword too at the united nations and elsewhere , speaking of how saddam needed only a softballsize helping of uranium to wreak armageddon on america but hardly had mr bush done so than , offstage , out of view of us civilian spectators , the whole premise of this propaganda campaign was being challenged by forces with more official weight than joseph wilson in october , the national intelligence estimate , distributed to congress as it deliberated authorizing war , included the state department s caveat that claims of iraqi pursuit of natural uranium in africa , made public in a british dossier , were highly dubious a cia assessment , sent to the white house that month , determined that the evidence is weak and the africa story is overblown as if this were n't enough , a state department intelligence analyst questioned the legitimacy of some mysterious documents that had surfaced in italy that fall and were supposed proof of the iraqniger uranium transaction in fact , they were blatant forgeries when mohamed elbaradei , the director general of the international atomic energy agency , said as much publicly in the days just before shock and awe , his announcement made none of the three evening newscasts the administration s apocalyptic uranium rhetoric , sprinkled with mushroom clouds , had been hammered incessantly for more than five months by then not merely in the state of the union address and could not be dislodged as scenarios go , this one was about as subtle as independence day and just as unstoppable a crowdpleaser once we were locked into the war , and no wmd s could be found , the original plot line was dropped with an alacrity that recalled the never mind ! with which gilda radner s emily litella used to end her misinformed weekend update commentaries on saturday night live the administration began its dogatemyhomework coverup , asserting that the various warning signs about the uranium claims were lost in the bowels of the bureaucracy or that it was all the cia s fault or that it did n't matter anyway , because there were new , retroactive rationales to justify the war but the administration knows how guilty it is that s why it has so quickly trashed any insider who contradicts its story line about how we got to iraq , starting with the former treasury secretary paul o'neill and the former counterterrorism czar richard clarke next to white house courtiers of their rank , mr wilson is at most a rosencrantz or guildenstern the brief against the administration s drumbeat for war would be just as damning if he 'd never gone to africa but by overreacting in panic to his single oped piece of two years ago , the white house has opened a pandora s box it ca n't slam shut seasoned audiences of presidential scandal know that there s only one certainty ahead the timing of a karl rove resignation as always in this genre , the knight takes the fall at exactly that moment when it s essential to protect the king
irvington , nj , oct 3 the residential motel where three people died in a fire on sunday morning was cited twice in the past year for illegally chaining its exit doors shut , the authorities said monday fire officials were investigating reports from residents that some of those doors were chained at the time of the fire at least 14 people were injured in the fire at the 80room irvington motor lodge , and one remained in critical condition on monday at beth israel medical center in newark guests said they had to break through glass windows to escape the blaze sunday morning , and some said that firefighters trying to rescue people had to cut through a padlocked chain that held a pair of glass exit doors closed the irvington fire chief , donald m huber , would not say on monday whether any of the exit doors had been chained , saying the fire and its cause were still under investigation but an owner of the motel , randy maisuria , said that none of the doors were chained shut on sunday , and that none had been chained since april , when the motel was fined 2 , 000 for chaining its exits we were keeping the door chained at night because people would go in the side doors , he said but on sunday , he said , i know 100 percent we never had a chain here residents of the area complained that the motel attracted drug users and prostitutes edward hilliard , 26 , who had lived in the motel for 11 months , and whose grandmother is believed to have died in the fire , said on monday that he frequently encountered drug users in the motel i 've had to run crackheads out of the hallways , he said they would sleep in the hallways and smoke in the hallways , and whatever they could , they would do it mr maisuria acknowledged that some customers had used drugs but said he had been powerless to keep them out or kick them out as long as they paid their rent room rates were 65 to 95 a night problems at the motel led the american red cross of metropolitan new jersey several

third victim also was found in a room on the third floor gary shumlich , the assistant chief of the irvington fire department , said the motel was cited for two fire code violations this year , on feb 17 and april 14 , for chaining doors closed firefighters removed the chains both times since then , fire officials have inspected the motel 8 to 10 times but found no chains , according to capt joe giamella the fire department has been called to the motel frequently , nearly invariably for false alarms , sometimes set off by people smoking crack in the hallways , according to captain giamella after responding to 100 false alarms between november 2004 and april 2005 , the irvington fire department ordered the motel to install a new alarm system , which was added three weeks ago in the neighborhood on monday , mourners recalled the victims gertrude day , 62 , mr day s mother , who lives half a block from the motel , said he had been a fashion model in new york years ago , and he loved shopping and imitating the singers in destiny s child i'm going to really miss todd , because todd kept me happy , she said he 'd come in and crack a joke he s been like that since he was a baby his cousin anita adams , 38 , said mr day had been visiting his friend , ms jones , early sunday morning spencer edwards , 40 , said he had known ms jones for two years he recalled the way she used to

there are about 10 million blogs out there , give or take , including one belonging to niall kennedy , an employee at technorati , a small san franciscobased company that , yes , tracks blogs like many employees at many companies , mr kennedy has opinions , even when he is not working one evening last month , he channeled one of those offduty opinions into a satiric bit of artwork an appropriation of a loose lips sink ships world war iiera propaganda poster altered to provide a harsh comment on the growing fears among corporations over the blogging activities of their employees he then posted it on his personal web log but in a paradoxical turn , mr kennedy s employer , having received some complaints about the artwork , stepped in and asked him to reconsider the posting and mr kennedy complied , taking the image down the past day has been a huge wakeup call , mr kennedy wrote soon afterward i see now that the voice of a company is not limited to toplevel executives , vice presidents and public relations officers as the practice of blogging has spread , employees like mr kennedy are coming to the realization that corporations , which spend millions of dollars protecting their brands , are under no particular obligation to tolerate threats , real or perceived , from the activities of people who become identified with those brands , even if it is on their personal web sites they are also learning that the law offers no special protections for blogging certainly no more than for any other offduty activity as annalee newitz , a policy analyst with the electronic frontier foundation , a digital rights advocacy group in washington , put it , what we found is there really is quite a bit of diversity in how employers are responding to blogging a rising tide of employees have recently been reprimanded or let go for running afoul of their employers' taste or temperament on personal blogs , including a flight attendant for delta air lines who learned the hard way that the carrier frowns on cheeky photos while in uniform and a google employee who mused on the company s financial condition and was fired some interpreted these actions as meaning that even in their living rooms , even in their private basement computer caves , employees are required to be at least a little bit worried about losing their jobs if they write or post the wrong thing on their personal web logs i would have expected that some of the louder , more strident voices on the internet would have risen up in a frenzy over this , said stowe boyd , the president of corante , a daily online news digest on the technology sector but that did n't happen in mr boyd s opinion , everything about what mr kennedy did was protected speech the use of trademarks was fair use in a satirical work , mr boyd said , and it seemed unlikely that the company would be somehow liable for the offduty actions of an employee , as technorati executives argued it was , in mr boyd s eyes , an indication that corporate interests were eclipsing individual rights i do n't know what else to say , he declared i'm astonished but ms newitz and others have cautioned that employees must be careful not to confuse freedom of speech with a freedom from consequences that might follow from what they say indeed , the vast majority of states are considered at will states meaning that employees can quit , and employers can fire them , at will without evident reason \( barring statutory exceptions like race or religion , where discrimination would have to be proved \) there really are no laws that protect you , ms newitz said martin h malin , a professor of law and director of the institute for law and the workplace at the chicagokent college of law , said there were only a few exceptions it depends on what the blog is , he said , what the content is , and whether there s any contractual protection for the employee those who work for the united states postal service , for instance , or a local sanitation department may have some special blogging privileges that is because , depending on the circumstances , the online speech of public employees can be considered of public concern , and enjoys a measure of protection , professor malin explained employees protected under some union contracts may also be shielded from summary dismissal for offduty activities , at least without some sort of arbitration lifestyle law trends of the late 1980 s and early 90 s sometimes driven by tobacco and alcohol lobbies created state laws that protected employees from being fired for engaging in legal , offduty activities , though no one is likely to be fired simply for blogging , but rather for violating some policy or practice in a blog and bloggers who are neither supervisors nor managers and who can demonstrate that they are communicating with other workers about wages , hours or working conditions may warrant some protection under the national labor relations act , professor malin said even in nonunion enterprises none of this , of course , answers the question of where the status of employee ends and that of private citizen begins some companies , like sun microsystems , have wrapped both arms around blogging sun provides space for employees to blog \( blogssuncom \) , and while their darker impulses are presumably kept at bay by the arrangement , there are hundreds of freewheeling and largely unmonitored diaries supported by the company microsoft , too , has benefited from the organic growth of online journaling by celebrity geeks now in its employ , like robert scoble , whose frank and uncensored musings about the company have developed a loyal following and given microsoft some street credibility but other companies are seeing a need for formalized blogging policies mark jen , who was fired from google in january after just two weeks , having made some illadvised comments about the company on his blog \( google would not comment on mr jen s dismissal , but confirmed that he no longer works for it \) , is now busy helping to draft a blogging policy for his new employer , plaxo , an electronic address book updating service in mountain view , calif it was a very quick education for me at google , mr jen said i learned very quickly the complexities of a corporate environment with plaxo s blessing , mr jen is soliciting public comment on the new blogging policy at blogplaxoedcom most of the points are the kinds of commonsense items that employees would do well to remember , particularly if they plan on identifying themselves as employees in their blogs , or discussing office matters online do n't post material that is obscene , defamatory , profane or libelous , and make sure that you indicate that the opinions expressed are your own the policy also encourages employee bloggers to use their real names , rather than attempting anonymity or writing under a pseudonym bad idea , according to the electronic frontier foundation two weeks ago , the group published a tutorial on how to blog safely , which included tips on avoiding getting fired chief among its recommendations blog anonymously basically , we just want to caution people about how easy it is to find them online , ms newitz said , and that they are not just talking to their friends on their blogs they 're talking to everyone but does that means that mr kennedy , a shorttimer , a product manager and by no means an executive at technorati , carries the burden of representing the company into his personal blog \? technorati s vice president for engineering , adam hertz , responded it would be antithetical to our corporate values to force niall to do anything in his blog it s his blog yet with the spread of the internet and of blogging , mr hertz said , it would be foolish for companies to not spend some time discussing the art of public communications with their employees , and even train and prepare lowerlevel staff for these kinds of public relations situations that said , mr hertz stressed that the company had no interest in formalizing any complicated policies regarding an employee s activities outside the office i had a high school teacher , he recalled , who used to say 'i have only two rules do n't rollerskate in the hallway and do n't be a damn fool' we really value a company where people can think for themselves correction june 3 , 2005

the hummingbird s daughter by luis alberto urrea 499 pp little , brown company 2495 in his essay the parable of the tapeworm , mario vargas llosa argues that at the heart of the writer s will to write is rebellion , a rejection and criticism of life as it is moreover , he speculates , it is even possible that good literature may inspire actual acts of rebellion when the reader compares the better world of the book to the relative junk heap of real life whether or not this is universally true \( charles bukowski , anyone \? \) , it s an attractive idea , and , in its way , a comforting one language is a lever that might move the enormous weight of the fickle , wartorn world we live in it s free , universal and highly portable better than plastique and difficult to govern vargas llosa s idea is also , of course , a writerly sort of realpolitik , a wish that a good novel or story or poem can literally remake history when luis alberto urrea began his epic novel , the hummingbird s daughter , 20 years ago , the united states was in the first phase of a conservative backlash , the culture wars were gathering steam , and the left felt itself to be under a dark cloud two decades later , the situation seems even graver the culture wars are more intense and the left feels under not a cloud but an anvil with the election of a new , deeply conservative pope , urrea s timing could n't be better his main character , teresita , is a saint as envisioned not in the marble reaches of the vatican but in the populist pueblos of liberation theology , a mexican saint of dust and blood , with lice in her hair and dirt under her fingernails poor , illegitimate , illiterate and despised , teresita is the embodiment of the dictum that the last shall be first , and her ascension over the course of 500 pages is a myth that is also a charmingly written manifesto urrea , who was born in tijuana to an american mother and a mexican father , is the author of 10 previous books of nonfiction , fiction and poetry the best known of these are probably the devil s highway and across the wire , nonfiction accounts of hardscrabble lives on the mexicanunited states border for the hummingbird s daughter , he reached back into his own family history , or what he calls a family folk tale teresa urrea , known in the novel as teresita , was a distant relative and , as urrea discovered , the subject of some earlier scholarship , an influential series of newspaper articles in the 1930 s and at least one other novel urrea s book reimagines her story on a grand scale , as a mix of leftist hagiography , mystical bildungsroman and melancholic national anthem the halfindian child of a wealthy mexican landowner , teresita , born in 1873 with a red triangle on her forehead , is also possessed of a supernatural gift for healing that becomes much stronger as she grows up , and stronger still after suffering a terrible assault that kills her she rises from the dead and begins to perform miracles the sick , the halt and the dying gather around her , and so do mexican revolutionaries everything the government does , teresita preaches to them , is morally wrong this democratic groundswell inevitably results in a showdown with the mexican authorities teresita s endurance and survival are literally and spiritually linked to the struggles of mexico itself , a struggle that urrea sees firmly from the bottom up god is a worker , like us , huila , an aged curandera , instructs the young teresita he made the world he did n't hire poor indios to build it for him ! god has worker s hands just remember angels carry no harps angels carry hammers the style that urrea has adopted to tell teresita s and mexico s story partakes of this politics as well , being simultaneously dreamy , telegraphic and quietly lyrical like a vast mural , the book displays a huge cast of workers , whores , cowboys , rich men , bandits and saints while simultaneously making them seem to float on the page urrea s sentences are simple , short and muscular he mixes low humor with metaphysics , bodily functions with deep and mysterious stirrings of the soul these 500 pages though they could have been fewer slip past effortlessly , with the amber glow of slides in a magic lantern , each one a tableau of the progress of earthy grace teresita crouched in the dirt praying over the souls of ants , teresita having a vision of god s messenger not as the fabled white dove but as an indigenous hummingbird , teresita plucking lice from the hair of a battered indian orphan in a pusshellacked jacket ferociously female though curiously asexual , teresita has a particular ability to deliver babies while soothing the pains of laboring mothers this , urrea is saying , is what matters miracles , teresita realizes as she learns midwifery , are bloody and sometimes come with mud sticking to them the salty cradle of life is the true church urrea s love for teresita , the mexican joan of arc , and for the world she helps bring into existence is one of the strongest elements of the book he is unstintingly , unironically and unselfconsciously tender he is a partisan with such passion and care in abundant evidence , one wishes to believe teresita is a saint we could really use right now , and i fervently hope she can be summoned to save the galaxy but there is a quality to urrea s novel that , for all the salt and blood and childbirth , is somehow a bit distant the hummingbird s daughter has the woodcut feeling of a bedtime story , or of family legends that have been told so many times they 've gone smooth , like the lettering on old gravestones teresita is the motherland and the mother of us all , an emissary from the time before , permanently encircled by butterflies and hummingbirds and the upraised rifles of revolutionaries she is , according to the precepts of a certain perspective , entirely perfect her flaws her love of the lowly and the sick , her unladylike strength , her uncouth habits are clearly marks of virtue to anyone but the most bloodless capitalist even after she s declared dead , she manages to win myths , of course , both defy and rebuke this sort of quibbling the gods always arise from a time much larger and deeper than the present moment , and we invent them because we need to believe in someone or something greater than ourselves in vargas llosa s scheme of things , is n't teresita the invention we need to ignite a better world \? but it is exactly this aspect of the hummingbird s daughter that makes it seem sealed off from the kaleidoscopic , indeterminate , lossriven borderlands of modernity that urrea has written about in earlier books with such depth toward the end of the novel , as some of the main characters flee to great , dark north america , they feel as if the country they 've left is a strange dream as beautiful as that dream that notion of the unbroken whole may be , at this late date none of us live there we 're all citizens of a haunted , mongrel terrain where nothing , not even the most appealing saint , is that simple stacey d'erasmo is the author of the novels tea and a seahorse year
somewhere between a 25point pledge and a 12step program , the portland trail blazers are officially lost , exactly like their season after firing the likable maurice cheeks as coach last week , the blazers must confront their poor choices and reinvent themselves yet again who are they now \? theirs is a cautionary tale for teams operating with a sense of urgency to change but proceeding without an identity over the past four seasons , and especially the last two , the blazers took the fun out of dysfunction because of player arrests , intrasquad fights and dog fights the portland fans practically cried when cheeks was fired last wednesday , and the city council passed a resolution the next day to thank him for his good character cheeks s 6374 record over the past two seasons prompted blazers executives to act , their questionable record of trades \( remember the deal last year that sent rasheed wallace to atlanta on his way to detroit \? \) and draft picks for dubious characters having done little to support him so now it is up to kevin pritchard , promoted to interim coach after serving as director of player personnel for less than a year , to evaluate the current and future team some veterans might have to make some sacrifices , and we 're going to take a look at our young guys , pritchard said wednesday at a news conference so , sebastian telfair , the 5foot11 rookie point guard from brooklyn , who has not found his shot yet in the pros , will have a chance to show his stuff the veteran point guard damon stoudamire will most likely go because his contract expires this summer nick van exel has a 12 million team option , which the blazers will most likely not pick up forward shareef abdurrahim could be packaged in a signandtrade deal because his contract will also expire general manager john nash signed zach randolph \( the no 19 pick in the 2001 draft \) to a sixyear , 84 million extension this came after a season in which randolph was charged with driving under the influence of intoxicants the previous season , he punched ruben patterson in practice and broke his eye socket in the offseason , nash also gave a sixyear extension \( for 48 million \) to darius miles , whose insubordination foreshadowed cheeks s departure nash could be next the blazers have an option on his contract if they let their free agents walk after this season , the blazers will have a payroll of about 36 million next season , about 10 million under the salary cap the freeagent crop will be slim , highlighted by ray allen of seattle and michael redd of milwaukee if there is any bright spot , nash said , it is the recent play of joel przybilla , a 71 center although przybilla has led the team or shared the lead in rebounding in 18 of the last 28 games , he is not a player around whom to build a franchise the blazers also failed to forge a team identity through the draft in 2002 , they took qyntel woods at no 21 \( the pistons took tayshaun prince two spots later \) portland waived woods last fall , after he was investigated for animal abuse because he trained his dogs to fight , a felony in oregon a year earlier , he was charged with marijuana possession in 2003 , the blazers drafted the 69 high school player travis outlaw no 23 over all he has yet to bloom this past summer , the blazers , by virtue of missing the playoffs for the first time in 22 years , had two firstround picks at no 13 they chose telfair and at no 22 they drafted 69 viktor khryapa of russia , who never had a strong international reputation during his threeplus seasons as coach , cheeks also dealt with stoudamire s and wallace s arrests on charges of marijuana possession the blazers shipped out wallace and the confrontational bonzi wells to rid themselves of image problems , but little has changed when nash and steve patterson , the team president , took over in 2003 , they made a big production of their 25point pledge to fans to change the franchise no 1 to evaluate character as well as basketball talent when selecting players no 21 to provide affordable inarena food options for special game nights at least the fans are getting fries with that silver lining for cheeks getting out of portland might turn out to be the best thing for maurice cheeks , whose 15year nba playing career earned him friends throughout the league and respect among most players if pistons coach larry brown decides to retire or to pursue another job , detroit will consider hiring cheeks , an eastern conference executive said given brown s history , that is not improbable , despite his recent assurances that detroit would be his last job and given cheeks s strong relationships with players including rasheed wallace it figures that the pistons will keep him in mind with the known coaching openings \( knicks , lakers , timberwolves \) and the possibilities \( orlando \) , cheeks may have a busy interviewing schedule many happy returns note to equipment managers never throw out uniforms when players leave the team some players feel they can , indeed , go home again boston pulled off the ultimate twofornone deal in the past two weeks danny ainge , the celtics' executive director for basketball operations , traded gary payton to atlanta for antoine walker , a former celtics allstar but after the hawks bought out payton s contract last week , the celtics reacquired him for the remainder of the 14 million veterans' minimum that was more than phoenix was able to offer payton , who opted to stay on the east coast even though he has a house in las vegas league executives and owners contacted in the past week wondered whether ainge had an existing deal with payton , an intimation ainge vehemently denied tim frank , an nba spokesman , said friday that the league did not intend to investigate the matter in another happy return , elden campbell went back to detroit on friday after the nets bought out his contract for 500 , 000 half of what they would have paid him to sit on the bench the nets felt that campbell was not in adequate shape , and they were able to make a deal for clifford robinson also last week , new orleans waived dale davis , who then signed with indiana , where he played the first nine seasons of his career donnie walsh , the pacers' president , offered part of the team s midlevel exception to lure davis and outbid other interested teams , including detroit davis returned at the right time for the pacers , who on thursday lost their leader , jermaine o'neal , to a sprained right shoulder up and down the nuggets entered last night s game against the clippers on a fivegame winning streak after winning eight straight , the pistons lost in phoenix on thursday and in seattle on friday carmelo anthony , flush from his most valuable player performance in the sophomorerookie game during allstar weekend in denver , was averaging 226 points and 68 rebounds in the nuggets' run detroit is narrowing its championship focus , with all five starters playing to their potential tayshaun prince has been the xfactor on both ends of the court he averaged 193 points and 73 rebounds during the pistons' recent winning streak since making tradingdeadline deals , atlantic division rivals have had divergent results the celtics won four straight after reacquiring antoine walker chris webber struggled in his first three games with philadelphia , and the 76ers won only one but he broke out friday night with a 24point , 12rebound effort in a victory over cleveland
a team of scientists at the university of utah has proposed that the unusual pattern of genetic diseases seen among jews of central or northern european origin , or ashkenazim , is the result of natural selection for enhanced intellectual ability the selective force was the restriction of ashkenazim in medieval europe to occupations that required more than usual mental agility , the researchers say in a paper that has been accepted by the journal of biosocial science , published by cambridge university press in england the hypothesis advanced by the utah researchers has drawn a mixed reaction among scientists , some of whom dismissed it as extremely implausible , while others said they had made an interesting case , although one liable to raise many hackles it would be hard to overstate how politically incorrect this paper is , said steven pinker , a cognitive scientist at harvard , noting that it argues for an inherited difference in intelligence between groups still , he said , it s certainly a thorough and wellargued paper , not one that can easily be dismissed outright absolutely anything in human biology that is interesting is going to be controversial , said one of the report s authors , dr henry harpending , an anthropologist and a member of the national academy of sciences he and two colleagues at the university of utah , gregory cochran and jason hardy , see the pattern of genetic disease among the ashkenazi jewish population as reminiscent of blood disorders like sickle cell anemia that occur in populations exposed to malaria , a disease that is only 5 , 000 years old in both cases , the utah researchers argue , evolution has had to counter a sudden threat by favoring any mutation that protected against it , whatever the side effects ashkenazic diseases like taysachs , they say , are a side effect of genes that promote intelligence the explanation that the ashkenazic disease genes must have some hidden value has long been accepted by other researchers , but no one could find a convincing infectious disease or other threat to which the ashkenazic genetic ailments might confer protection a second suggestion , wrote dr jared diamond of the university of california , los angeles , in a 1994 article , is selection in jews for the intelligence putatively required to survive recurrent persecution , and also to make a living by commerce , because jews were barred from the agricultural jobs available to the nonjewish population the utah researchers have built on this idea , arguing that for some 900 years jews in europe were restricted to managerial occupations , which were intellectually demanding , that those who were more successful also left more offspring , and that there was time in this period for the intelligence of the ashkenazi population as a whole to become appreciably enhanced but the utah researchers' analysis comes at a time when some geneticists have suggested natural selection is not the reason for the ashkenazic diseases after all two years ago , dr neil risch , a geneticist now at the university of california , san francisco , proposed a different genetic mechanism known as a founder effect , which occurs when a population is reduced for a time he found that all the ashkenazic diseases had similar properties , including having arisen within the last 1 , 100 years therefore they had all arisen through the same cause , he argued , which must be founder effects , because it was unlikely that all could be due to natural selection last year , dr montgomery slatkin of the university of california , berkeley , came to much the same conclusion for different reasons the utah team agrees with dr risch that the diseases all arose in historical times from the same cause but say natural selection is more likely because none of the nondisease ashkenazic genes they tested showed any sign of a founder effect they say the clustering of four of the diseases in the same biochemical pathway could only have arisen under the influence of natural selection , and calculate that the odds of a founder effect producing such a cluster are vanishingly low the four diseases , all of which are caused by mutations that affect the cell s management of chemicals known as sphingolipids , are taysachs , niemannpick , gaucher , and mucolipidosis type iv a second cluster of diseases affects repair of dna turning to the possibility that some infection was the cause of the selective effect , the utah researchers noted that ashkenazim and europeans lived together in the same cities and were exposed to the same microbes if disease were the agent of selection , the utah team argues , the european population would have developed a similar genetic response ashkenazi jews occupied a different social niche from their european hosts , and that is where any selective effect must have operated , the utah researchers say from ad 800 , when the ashkenazi presence in europe is first recorded , to about 1700 , ashkenazi jews held a restricted range of occupations , which required considerable intellectual acumen in france , most were moneylenders by ad 1100 expelled from france in 1394 , and from parts of germany in the 15th century , they moved eastward and were employed by polish rulers first as moneylenders and then as agents who paid a large tax to a noble and then tried to collect the amount , at a profit , from the peasantry after 1700 , the occupational restrictions on jews were eased as to how the disease mutations might affect intelligence , the utah researchers cite evidence that the sphingolipid disorders promote the growth and interconnection of brain cells mutations in the dna repair genes , involved in second cluster of ashkenazic diseases , may also unleash growth of neurons in describing what they see as the result of the ashkenazic mutations , the researchers cite the fact that ashkenazi jews make up 3 percent of the american population but won 27 percent of its nobel prizes , and account for more than half of world chess champions they say that the reason for this unusual record may be that differences in ashkenazic and northern european iq are not large at the average , where most people fall , but become more noticeable at the extremes for people with an iq over 140 , the proportion is 4 per 1 , 000 among northern europeans but 23 per 1 , 000 with ashkenazim the utah researchers describe their proposal as a hypothesis unlike many speculations , it makes a testable prediction that people who carry one of the sphingolipid or other ashkenazic disease mutations should do better than average on iq tests the researchers have identified two reasonably well accepted issues , the puzzling pattern of diseases inherited by the ashkenazi population and the population s general intellectual achievement but in trying to draw a link between them they have crossed some fiercely disputed academic territories , including whether iq scores are a true measure of intelligence and the extent to which intelligence can be inherited the authors make pretty much all of the classic mistakes in interpreting heritability , said dr andrew clark , a population geneticist at cornell university , and the argument that the sphingolipid gene variants are associated with intelligence , he said , is farfetched in addition , the genetic issue of natural selection versus founder effects is far from settled dr risch , whose research supports founder effects , said he was not persuaded by the utah team s arguments dr david goldstein , a geneticist at duke university who was not connected with either dr risch s or the utah study , was more open on the issue , saying dr risch had made quite a strong case that founder effects could be the cause , but had not ruled out the possibility of selection dr slatkin , though favoring a founder effect over all , said he agreed with the utah team that this would not account for the cluster of sphingolipid diseases as for the utah researchers' interpretation of jewish medieval history , paul rose , professor of jewish studies at pennsylvania state university , said , i think that some of their conclusions may be right though they still need a lot of work to be persuasive to historians and others dr gregory cochran , the first author on the utah team s paper and a physicist who took up biology , said he became interested in the subject upon learning that patients with a particular ashkenazic disease known as torsion dystonia were told by their physicians that the positive thing is that this makes you smart when you 're in a hurry and have strong selection , you have a lot of genes with bad side effects , he said the ashkenazi jewish population seemed to fit this pattern , he said , since they married only inside the community , making selection possible , and they had an urgent need for greater intelligence evolution had therefore selected every possible mutation that worked in this direction , despite their harmful side effects when inherited from both parents in a sense , i consider this a very boring paper since it raises no new principles of genetics , dr cochran said
miami , april 30 with a bill on a broad new crackdown on sex offenders awaiting gov jeb bush s signature , florida will soon begin the nation s most aggressive monitoring of child molesters at a time when dozens of states and localities are reexamining their policies in sharpening their statutes , many jurisdictions are deciding that federal mandates , approved after highly publicized sex crimes against children in the 1990 s , are not enough florida s renewed focus comes 12 years after congress voted to require every state to establish a registry of sex offenders and nearly a decade after it passed megan s law , which orders law enforcement officials to notify communities about sex offenders in their midst as lawmakers contemplate just how far they can go to close loopholes that present themselves as new crimes are committed , tough questions abound on money , privacy and practicality as roxanne lieb , director of the washington state institute for public policy , which tracks sex offender laws around the country , put it the issue is , what can you do short of putting them all in prison for the rest of their lives \? states and counties are increasingly turning to electronic monitoring of freed sex offenders to try to make sure they stay away from schools , playgrounds and other places where children congregate while the norm is to monitor only the most violent offenders , florida s new law , which takes effect in september and will cost 13 million in the first year , will require those who molest children younger than 12 to wear satellite tracking devices for life once they leave prison the law , which governor bush plans to sign monday , will also force those offenders to stay in prison longer , establishing minimum sentences of 25 years for anyone convicted of lewd and lascivious acts against a child that is roughly three times the average sentence currently imposed on child molesters in the state , according to the florida department of corrections other states are also considering increased supervision of child sex offenders , including more frequent visits from parole officers and limits on where offenders can live and work legislation pending in illinois would require lifetime supervision of some serious offenders instead of the current three years ohio now lets local prosecutors evict sex offenders who move within 1 , 000 feet of a school , and new mexico requires sex offenders to submit dna samples laura a ahearn , executive director of parents for megan s law , a national organization based in new york , said the best measures , such as longer sentences and lifetime supervision , are often dismissed as too expensive it s a lot easier for lawmakers to say we 're going to solve the problem by putting a bracelet on their ankle , ms ahearn said they 're stepping up to the mike and making political promises , but they want to get reelected and they wo n't raise taxes ms ahearn praised florida s move toward longer sentencing for child molesters , though , and said that even before the new crackdown , the state had some of the harshest policies against sex offenders there are more registered offenders here , about 35 , 000 , than in any state but california and texas the legislature , which originally required sex offenders to remain on the registry for 10 years , increased it to 30 years under the new law in new york , more than 3 , 000 offenders are scheduled to come off the registry next year , though gov george e pataki recently proposed keeping every offender on it for life florida also has a costly law , enacted after a 9yearold boy was raped and killed in homestead in 1995 , authorizing the indefinite confinement of offenders after their sentences expire if they have been defined as sexually violent predators though some 20 states have similar laws , florida keeps among the most offenders , about 475 , in confinement the offenders are supposed to be treated until they are deemed fit to rejoin society , but the law has been met with criticism because few of those detained accept treatment and few are ever released though every new sanction is meant to stop sex crimes against children , critics say many are largely symbolic efforts electronic monitoring , for example , is not failsafe because an offender can remove the device longer sentences are also no guarantee because children are often too young to testify accurately , allowing many offenders to plead guilty to lesser crimes if they think it s going to help that much , they 're ripe for a fall , john skye , an assistant public defender in hillsborough county in florida , said of the legislature and the new law instead of creating new laws , i think we should be focusing on how to prevent these people from becoming the way they are the legislation was spurred by two recent cases in florida because the men charged in the murders of jessica lunsford , 9 , and sarah lunde , 13 , were already registered as sex offenders , there is also renewed national interest in tightening registration compliance ms ahearn s group estimates that of more than 500 , 000 registered offenders nationwide , up to a quarter are missing john e couey , the man charged with killing jessica , did not inform the state when he moved to her neighborhood north of tampa under florida s new law , offenders will have to check in at their local county jail twice a year or face felony charges other places have begun requiring offenders to provide exact home addresses instead of proximate ones , as well as workplace addresses , ms ahearn said there is little consistency from state to state some put photos and highly specific details about every offender on the internet , while others provide information about only the most serious offenders or none at all in norfolk county , mass , residents can sign up to receive email messages alerting them when a sex offender moves nearby in florida , curiosity about the registry and community notification rules has grown markedly since the deaths of jessica and sarah , state officials said people searched the online registry more than two million times this month , up from 450 , 000 times in february , according to the florida department of law enforcement in miami beach , officials want to ban sex offenders from living within 2 , 500 feet of schools or parks , instead of the 1 , 000 feet required by state law , making it nearly impossible for offenders to reside there in some states , civil libertarians have tried to limit the posting of personal information on public registries and have fought the aggressive notification of communities about offenders howard simon , executive director of the american civil liberties union of florida , said lifetime satellite tracking of every child molester was too much it ought to be decided on a casebycase basis by a judge , mr simon said though some experts say that safeguards like electronic monitoring are pointless without treatment , research on its effectiveness remains spotty state senator gary siplin , a democrat from orlando , said he would push for florida to provide more treatment for convicted molesters but now , he said , was not the time their judgment is clouded right now , mr siplin said of his colleagues , which i understand , because it just does n't make sense what happened to the little girls still , mr siplin said , if people are in jail for however many years and get out and still have those desires and urges , they are going to harm someone else
san francisco , sept 23 microsoft will achieve one of its longestheld ambitions on monday when its rival palm computing plans to announce that it will use microsoft s windows mobile software in a new version of its popular cellphoneorganizer , the treo verizon wireless , which will market the phone , will join in the announcement at an event here , according to several people involved emphasizing the significance of the alliance for microsoft , bill gates , its chairman , will be present executives at the companies would not comment friday on the substance of the announcement one feature not immediately available in the windows software , however , will be the ability to push email to users as it arrives , rather than forcing them to fetch it , according to an industry specialist with detailed knowledge of the announcement such a feature would be necessary to make the system a direct competitor to the blackberry , made by research in motion the microsoftpalm alliance marks an end of an era palm produced the first successful handheld computer in the mid1990 s in 2003 , when palm inc acquired handspring , a company created by palm s founders , it used the handspring treo to build its position in the market for cellphones with personalorganizer capabilities palm has struggled to find a compelling software direction and to replace its aging and fragile palm operating system at different times the company has shifted strategies , acquiring the be operating system , experimenting with linux alternatives and even contracting with steve capps , an apple and microsoft programming wizard , to develop software technology none of those efforts were successfully commercialized , and in the end palm s chief executive , ed colligan , apparently decided that it was more expedient to join microsoft than fight on as an alternative microsoft has led a long , costly and often frustrating campaign to gain an opening in the handheld software world indeed , only in its nextgeneration mobile software , expected by the end of this year , is it reported to reach the industrial strength standards demanded by the consumer electronics industry , according to a range of industry executives at the end of the day , ed colligan made the call that he would be getting more value out of windows mobile than the palm os , said greg galanos , a silicon valley venture capitalist who is a board member of danger inc , a palm competitor indeed , a crucial factor in the alliance may have been palm s ability to get a sweet deal from microsoft , according to an industry insider with detailed knowledge of microsoft s pricing arrangements microsoft has set the price of windows mobile at 13 per handset , said the executive , who spoke on the condition that he not be identified because he is a competitor in the handheld computing market but microsoft has also discounted its software to as little as 3 per cellphone in highly competitive situations , the executive said the price range makes microsoft an expensive alternative compared to competitors like symbian and qualcomm s brew , as well as linux alternatives , according to an industry executive a microsoft spokesman said the company would not comment on the pricing arrangements one significant question raised by the microsoftpalm alliance is the future of palm software developers in the past , palm has pointed to the large library of programs available to users of palm devices as an advantage over microsoft silicon valley software developers say palm may move its programming environment to the new windows mobile operating system
turin , italy looming over the piazza castello , a vast square in turin s heart where elaborate nightly medal presentations will be staged during the 2006 winter olympics , is a 100foothigh castle incorporating roman , renaissance and baroque architecture across nearly eight centuries of the city s history , layer upon layer was added to the palazzo madama , a simultaneous tribute to change and tradition a short walk from piazza castello , in another city square , two futuristic structures and a skating rink were recently built around a 130yearold statue exhibits inside the structures educate local residents about the reformation of their graying olympic city , while the rink , packed from lunchtime to midevening , enables the postindustrial populace to learn how to skate on the outskirts of the city , a jagged facade of a soccer stadium commissioned by benito mussolini in 1932 is being restored under watchful eyes the new plate glass windows , by city mandate , had to match the original design , but the rooftop superstructure enveloping the old crumbling stone walls contains 44 skyboxes on feb 10 , 2006 , stadio olimpic , site of the opening ceremony , will be the first showpiece of the 20th winter olympiad the winter games , smaller and less urbane than its summer sister , will arrive in this outoftheway city in western italy and its surrounding mountains in a little more than a year after the agita of the athens olympics , and the judging and bribery scandals of the 2002 winter games in salt lake city , the olympics will turn to turin for an odd mix of old world solace and dynamism the olympic movement needs something old a simple , scandalfree olympic games and it needs something new an olympic games with soldout arenas and a modern buzz turin , steeped in the layers of its 2 , 000year history and attempting to transform itself once again , aims to be the place it is the essence of turin s olympic mission we have something to offer the identity and image of the olympics , and that is an olympic games imbedded in the italian culture , valentino castellani , president of the turin organizing committee , said past olympics may have been too focused on the athletic competition and not enough on a cultural olympics we want these games to concentrate on participation and passion we gather in our piazzas , our town squares , for events and we 've tried to replicate the feel of an italian piazza in our competition venues our medal ceremony will be in a piazza the lesson of the athens games is that there was no place for people to socialize most of the local people were on vacation at our olympics , we want the holiday going on in the city in turin , they have taken to calling these the piazza olympics , a tribute to speed skating , ski jumping , snowboarding and a certain elegant italian silk style if all goes as planned , these olympics are supposed to make winter sports fans pause in the village and city squares to appreciate the mountains and the marble as much as the olympic medals to host fans from around the world , you have to make them feel welcome , said silvia tracchi , manager of the olympic stadium , which is adjacent to the new 12 , 000seat ice hockey arena the area surrounding these arenas is designed to be parkland , laid out like a japanese garden , which it will become in the spring inside the main stadium , there will be no fence , railing or barrier separating the first row of 30 , 000 seats and the infield , the setting of the opening and closing ceremonies everyone should feel part of the celebration , tracchi said that the construction of the main stadium , and virtually every olympic arena , appears on schedule may be more a cause for celebration , especially within the offices of the international olympic committee the stadium will be done , as scheduled , by the end of september , remo mendolicchio , the head engineer of the project , said , standing in the rows of the refurbished grandstand for sure there is no doubt whatsoever none massimo pianotti , the manager of the nearby ice hockey arena , supervised the bustle of two and three shifts of workers laboring on the same day and gave a similarly firm prediction with the same construction timetable several arenas have already been the site of competitions the european figure skating championships will be held in the new figure skating arena on jan 24 a world cup slalom was held in the mountain village of sestriere last month and a world cup ski jumping event will be staged in the adjacent town of pragelato in midfebruary some construction , like the speed skating oval and olympic village , will not be completed until the summer but the construction does not have to be finalized right now , because the olympics are not this year , they are next year , gilbert felli , the ioc s executive director of the olympic games , said we do n't foresee any problems with the construction we are pleased with the progress they are on schedule of course , as long as there is construction going on anywhere , we have to watch the pace like the systemic renovation efforts going on throughout turin construction workers are busy in every sector the creation of the olympic competition sites has frequently recast existing structures for new uses it is part of the turin olympic plan to use the city s historical resources , both for the local flavor they will provide and to keep the scope of the olympic infrastructure understated they did this so there would be fewer large , empty buildings in the postolympic period , and not coincidentally , fewer large buildings with swaths of empty seats during the olympic games 13 months from now for example , the palavela , the arena that will be host of the figure skating and newly popular shorttrack speed skating competitions , has a capacity of fewer than 9 , 000 , which should not be hard to fill for any of the prime attractions the decision on the arena s size was made before the 2004 games , but when television cameras caught the unoccupied seats at many events in athens , turin officials felt especially satisfied with their choice of a smaller , cozier facility for the marquee event of the winter games the palavela is likely to be one of the landmarks of the turin games its outer shell , a giant castconcrete structure weighing 35 , 000 tons and shaped like a threepoint sail attached to the ground , was built in 1961 to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the unification of italy the new figure skating arena was built up beneath the immense sail the olympic village , the huge media and broadcast center , and the speed skating oval will take up part of the more than 21 million square feet of former industrial space being overhauled for olympic use most of that space comes from buildings that were once factories for fiat , the auto company that in its heyday employed 130 , 000 people in the region and brought turin a nickname the detroit of italy fiat s presence in the city has waned in the last 20 years , and construction for the 2006 games has helped bring new life to abandoned industrial wastelands but for all their efforts to use space economically in the city , the turin olympic organizers could not bridge one significant geographic gap that will certainly define the 2006 games they could not move the mountains closer to the city it is likely the turin olympics will be , in effect , two olympics city and mountain peaks the alpine and freestyle skiing , snowboarding , bobsled , luge , skeleton , ski jumping , biathlon and crosscountry skiing will all be contested in six mountain locales ordinarily , these sites are not much more than a 90minute drive from turin but during the olympics next year , some people estimate the trip from turin to sestriere , site of most of the alpine events , could take double the normal time , or more there are highways to the foothills , but the roads from there go through twisting mountain passes and are often perched on narrow cliffs these passageways will likely struggle to handle the high volume of official olympic bus traffic the transportation issue is going to be a difficult one , felli of the ioc said the transportation problem begat another problem accommodations in the mountains once the topography was understood , more of those expecting to participate in or cover the olympics requested lodging in the mountains , outpacing turin organizers' initial projections by several thousand hotel rooms but an additional 2 , 000 rooms have been located and tourism officials say they will find hundreds more this winter in some parts of the mountain region , organizers are going street by street to encourage owners of vacation houses in the various mountain villas to rent their homes during the olympics they have worked very hard to fill all the requests , felli said there may be some need for temporary lodging , but we will know more later this month the ioc has been more focused on a familiar olympic predicament cost overruns there has also been a particularly familiar italian state of affairs , political squabbles in november , turin officials faced a 242 million budget shortfall and police officers arrived in the organizing committee s office to inspect financial records mario pescante , a government undersecretary and an ioc member , was appointed to serve as a new supervisor for the 2006 olympics castellani , a former mayor of turin , threatened to resign some turin officials felt politicians from rome were trying to take over the games after working out a powersharing agreement with pescante , castellani remained in his post we clarified that he is joining our team , not substituting it , castellani said then , in december , the turin olympic committee announced that a combination of aid from the italian government and corporate sponsorships would add as much as 200 million to the budget for the games we had to push on some issues in the fall , but the direction has changed positively , felli said the income in italy will be secure we 're pretty safe there there is some work to do , but they have the money to keep working there remains the question of whether all of italy will support the winter olympics as castellani conceded , sicily is far away and they are not much for snow but this is turin s olympics , its chance to put a new face on the 20th version of the winter games every olympics , like layers of history , remakes the image of the olympic movement in some way the first foundation for the palazzo madama in the piazza castello , which will be home to 50 medal presentations next winter , was laid in 1276 on a recent night , skateboarders mimicking the moves of olympic snowboarders flipped their boards and leapt on the smooth marble in front of the palace spotlights trained on the castle cast the skateboarders' freestyling athletics in long shadows across the square , which was filled with a slowmoving , if animated , beforedinner crowd five blocks away , people from men in their 70 s to toddlers formed a collective gaggle wobbling to skate around the new ceremonial rink standing next to a large official logo of the 2006 turin olympics , a line had formed waiting to test the experience
thomas r suozzi , the nassau county executive , presented what he described as a vision for a new suburbia on tuesday , offering ideas for transit systems and other amenities surrounding a new , midrise office development in and around the nassau coliseum the core development , including new office towers , a revamped nassau coliseum and outdoor greensward plazas above a lowered section of the hempstead turnpike , would become what mr suozzi described as the nassau crossroads the targeted growth would supply highpaying jobs and expand the tax base while still honoring residents' wishes for neighborhoods of singlefamily houses , white picket fences and ball fields , mr suozzi said he warned that unless revenueproducing growth resumed , residents would be overcome by rising property taxes and the county would wither the real problem that needs to be addressed is lack of growth , mr suozzi said we have stopped growing in an address on the 10h floor of the hofstra university library , where windows give a panoramic view of the socalled hub area of central nassau , mr suozzi , in a multifaceted but shortondetails proposal , also discussed a new transportation system providing direct access to the center and linking parks , workplaces , shopping malls and educational institutions in the hub area , which mr suozzi described as disjointed mr suozzi also spoke of transforming hempstead , which has a large black and hispanic population , into a college town with housing for students and teachers from hofstra as well as nearby adelphi university and nassau community college what a boon it would be to downtown hempstead if we could create a college environment in that downtown area , with each of these colleges and institutions being a stone s throw away , he said he said molloy college of rockville centre was already talking to the village about student housing mr suozzi also called for a zoo in eisenhower park and for unspecified new sports and entertainment venues within the hub an emerald ribbon of pedestrian walkways and bicycle paths would link parks , preserves and institutions , allowing , for example , a hofstra student to jog from campus to the eisenhower park zoo the emerald ribbon needs to be connected so that each of these assets are linked with each other , mr suozzi said the new transportation links would connect commercial and retail properties including eab plaza , the marriott hotel , the coliseum , the omni and garden city center office buildings , stewart avenue and the roosevelt field source shopping malls the nassau crossroads , mr suozzi said , would be a regional center easily reachable from manhattan , suffolk county and the north and south shores of nassau by public transportation the idea that you can take the train from manhattan straight to the nassau coliseum , that you can travel without taking your car from suffolk county over to the roosevelt field mall , that you can travel from the north shore or the south shore into this nassau centre , that s the concept behind the hub , he said mr suozzi said the county would use a 27 million federal grant to continue studying transportation alternatives that include rapidtransit buses traveling on dedicated road lanes , a light rail system and an automated guideway transit system a study that will evaluate the alternatives on the basis of environmental impact , cost and ridership estimates will be completed in about a year , he said the study will be needed to qualify for the largescale federal financing the county is relying on mr suozzi offered no estimate of the cost of his proposals nor any promise that anything would happen soon no shovel will be out in the ground because of today s announcement , he said today we begin to try to build a consensus on where we want to go as a community mr suozzi said he continued to support plans announced in september by the new york islanders owner , charles wang , for a 200 million transformation of the countyowned nassau coliseum mr wang s plan also includes development of a 70acre area around the coliseum , most notably with a 60story hotel and office building with a beacon on top the building , to be called the great lighthouse , would be the tallest on long island , but no depiction of it appeared on renderings released by mr suozzi s office peter schmitt , a republican from massapequa and the minority leader of the nassau county legislature , derided the proposal by mr suozzi , a democrat who is running for a second term in november obviously this is the beginning of the campaign , mr schmitt said this is wally world or suozzi land or whatever you want to call it , a very grandiose plan at a time when we have the lowest police count that we 've had in years , a declining infrastructure in our parks , and dumping in our parks he ca n't maintain what we have , and he comes up with this but others said mr suozzi was unusually visionary for a politician and deserved public support it s great to see a politician actually stepping up and saying that this is how we should grow and giving a plan for the future , said kate slevin , the associate director of the tristate transportation campaign in manhattan robert d yaro , the president of the regional plan association in manhattan , estimated that to keep pace with the rest of the new york region , the island will have to add 500 , 000 new residents and 350 , 000 new jobs by 2030 at the moment , if current trends continue , none of those jobs and none of those new residents will come to nassau county and a relatively small share will come to long island , he said we simply do n't have the capacity for growth lisa tyson , the director of the long island progressive coalition in massapequa , said mr suozzi had enunciated a great vision filled with things the group had espoused for years we need a big vision for nassau , ms tyson said this is the big vision we can have a better nassau this is all possible but if people just say no right away and close their eyes it s never going to happen and that s been the history for nassau photo in this rendering released by the nassau county executive , thomas r suozzi , a redeveloped coliseum area would be connected to other attractions in the nassau hub by green corridors and some form of mass transit the rendering of the coliseum complex does not include the 60story tower and other features unveiled last year by the islanders owner , charles wang , but mr suozzi said he still supported the wang proposal \( photo by fox and fowle architects , pc \)
philadelphia , june 23 the mets' front office took a field trip to citizens bank park on thursday afternoon to survey the stadium and see what sort of features they might want to include in their ballpark of the future the mets , still in the embryonic planning stages , do not know about their outfield dimensions , their seating capacity or their dining options they are only certain that the stadium s infrastructure should include jos reyes at shortstop and batting leadoff and david wright at third base , regardless of the construction left to be done amenities will be added sometime before 2009 in a 43 victory over the philadelphia phillies on thursday , the mets' top officials saw the raw materials at their disposal while reyes had three hits and three stolen bases , looking like a quintessential leadoff man , wright committed a gaffe fit for a rookie the way these two young players are going , creating highlights and bloopers on a daily basis , wright will be the one with three hits friday night and reyes will make the mindfreezing mistake anything that can happen right now is happening , wright said reyes and wright , shuffled in the lineup for the past week , played thursday in front of the largest crowd at citizens bank park \( 45 , 449 \) , and they will play together at yankee stadium on friday night for the first time every game brings further proof that this mets season is as much about developing the organizational blueprint as it is about contending in the national league east manager willie randolph , still learning how to handle his young players , found out in this series that reyes might be a leadoff man after all as the leadoff batter twice in the series , reyes went 6 for 10 with four stolen bases and three runs scored , leading to two victories wright , meanwhile , had a hit in every game and a mental lapse in every game , two on the bases and one in the field he was thrown out thursday on a ground ball down the thirdbase line that he assumed was in left field wright did not see philadelphia third baseman david bell make a nifty backhand stop and a high offbalance throw if wright had run through first base , he would have beaten out the play instead , he made a wide turn approaching first as if the ball were in the outfield not only will wright be fined by the mets' kangaroo court , teammates have offered him an instructional video on base running the mets could laugh because they took two of three games in philadelphia and their starting pitcher thursday , kazuhisa ishii , won for only the second time this season when ishii came to citizens bank park in april , he threw 11 consecutive balls and issued six walks in his return , he gave up three runs in six and twothirds innings , keeping himself in the rotation for at least another turn ishii s dramatic and mysterious improvement may be attributed to his new interpreter , whom the mets hired when kazuo matsui s interpreter accompanied him to port st lucie , fla , where he is rehabilitating from a bruised knee when i came here the first time , i was terrible , ishii said through his new interpreter i have not been able to contribute to the team in a while and i 've caused some headaches for willie in the seventh inning , randolph made three pitching changes , but he finally settled on roberto hernandez , who struck out pat burrell with a onerun lead and two men on base even though burrell has 28 career home runs against the mets , ranking fourth among active players , he is 0 for 7 with four strikeouts against hernandez i just went after him like i 've always done , said hernandez , who was let go by the phillies after last season and has become the mets' primary setup man with a 203 earned run average i'm the kind of pitcher who is going to attack but by no means was it easy today after recording the most significant strikeout of the game , hernandez started the eighth inning by catching the first foul ball of his 14year major league career because the mets employ an exaggerated shift against the philadelphia slugger jim thome , none of the infielders could reach a pop fly that thome sent into foul territory on the thirdbase side after hernandez charged off the mound and made the play , it took him a couple of minutes to stop laughing and collect himself the mets were grateful to leave thome behind when they arrived in philadelphia , he had five home runs this season , but he added a homer in each of the past two games thome s counterpart , mets first baseman doug mientkiewicz , responded with two homers in the series , including a solo shot in the seventh that wound up being the gamewinner the mets and mientkiewicz are headed to yankee stadium , where he helped the boston red sox reach the world series last season wright , on the other hand , has never played a game at yankee stadium the mets are banking that he and reyes can follow each other from one ballpark to another inside pitch relief pitcher manny aybar cleared waivers and will report to class aaa norfolk carlos beltran s batting average dropped to 264 after he went 0 for 3 , but he did make a diving catch in center field willie randolph said that catcher mike piazza would be the designated hitter for one or two games against the yankees this weekend
to the editor historically , few topics have provoked as much hostility in the united states as interracial sex of all the possible pairings , none was more taboo than the comingling of a black male and a white female the antipathy was once so extreme that most state laws forbade interracial marriage , and many of the lynchings of africanamerican males in the 19th and early 20th centuries had sexual overtones in spite of these laws and customs , there were tens of thousands of mixedrace offspring on the plantations during slavery i doubt if many black men and white women would have been so reckless as to chance miscegenation amid such hostility so either they were exceedingly clever in hiding their dangerous liaisons , or some other blackwhite pairings produced all those mixedrace children what seems to have existed back then was extreme denial about human nature and a bizarre form of projection , much like what we have in hollywood today david l evans cambridge , mass , april 24 , 2005
camden , nj , june 25 the three missing boys who were found dead on friday after an enormous twoday search died accidentally , suffocating in a car trunk that the police had failed to check , the camden county prosecutor said saturday the police believe that the three boys , ages 5 , 6 and 11 , climbed into the trunk while playing on wednesday night , and that the lid then slammed shut , trapping them inside , said vincent p sarubbi , the prosecutor there were no signs of trauma , no signs of assault , mr sarubbi said this was a horrible accident police officials began an investigation into why none of the 150 officers assigned to the search checked the trunk of the car , a battered toyota camry parked just feet from where the boys were last seen wednesday evening , licking italian ice under a tree beside the oldest boy s home chief edwin j figueroa of the camden police department said that officers did search the car which belonged to the grandmother of one of the boys on the night the boys were reported missing , but added that he did not know why the trunk had been overlooked i ca n't guess what went on in the individual minds of the police officers out there , chief figueroa said the oversight , which the police concede may have led to the boys' deaths , has outraged residents of camden , where outofcontrol drug crime has claimed the lives of many young people the city , one of the poorest and most dangerous in america , always seems to have an image of despair hanging over it , residents said this week , however , they defied that by bonding together to help find the boys now , many feel let down it s so frustrating , because maybe something could have been done sooner , said maria rivera , a camden mother maybe this did n't have to happen according to what investigators have pieced together , the three boys anibal cruz , 11 , daniel agosto , 6 , and jesstin pagan , 5 were playing in the side yard of anibal s home in the cramer hill neighborhood around 5 pm anibal s mother , elba nelly cruz , and jesstin s mother , jessica pagan , were watching the children from ms cruz s front porch and then went inside ms cruz s home to cook dinner when they went back out a halfhour later , the boys were gone one of the boys mr sarubbi would not say who liked to play with the knobs and switches in the car , which had been parked in a bed of weeds next to the house for several weeks because it had a brake problem the car also had a trunk problem according to police , the trunk lid would not stay up after it was opened , and instead slammed shut the police believe that during the few minutes when the mother took her eyes off the children , the boys scampered into the trunk , and it locked behind them either the trunk was ajar or one of the boys pulled the release latch inside the car to open it the family immediately started canvassing the neighborhood , calling out the boys' names in panicky voices three hours later , they contacted the police , who began an extensive hunt the search involved bloodhounds , helicopters , boats , police divers , militarygrade heatseeking equipment and the combined efforts of hundreds of residents and safety personnel many people thought the boys had wandered down to a nearby riverbank , where it was thought they might have slipped into the water and drowned what is curious is how the three could have been trapped in a car in the yard of the house where dozens of relatives had gathered , with no one hearing a thing there s much to this situation that defies explanation , mr sarubbi said mr sarubbi declined to say whether there was any evidence that the boys had struggled to escape from the trunk he also said that the medical examiner could not determine the exact times of death on friday evening , daniel s father , david agosto , went to the car with a relative who was looking for jumper cables as soon as he opened the trunk , he shouted out in horror cousins , aunts , uncles and others ran to him they tried to pull mr agosto away , but he kept screaming the neighborhood soon shook with wails and sobs some people writhed on the sidewalk , pounding the concrete with their hands on saturday , cramer hill was quiet most of the tv news trucks had left down the street from where the bodies were found , mourners left candles , balloons , notes and more than two dozen stuffed animals in a memorial against a chainlink fence jose martinez , 41 , of camden , stopped by the memorial and placed a white teddy bear on the sidewalk i do n't know the family , but i wanted to help them search , to find the kids , he said now , i can just leave this small tribute
edgehill , england , feb 19 in 1642 , the english fought a battle here between royalists and parliamentarians at the beginning of their civil war on saturday they came to contest a newer struggle that , some might say , is not so different in spirit at all for the first time since a ban on fox hunting with dogs came into force in england and wales at midnight on thursday , hundreds of people on horseback and on foot gathered here under bright , cold skies to ride and run with the hounds in defiance , if not of the law then of the government of prime minister tony blair , which enacted the prohibition it s the end of a tradition , that s the important thing , said adam read , a forestry worker who arrived to follow the horses on foot with his two terriers while riding with hounds is not in itself illegal , and foxes may still be shot , the use of hounds to kill is against the new law its enactment has opened complex fissures evoking issues of class , politics , freedom and choice , setting some in the countryside against those in the cities who favor the ban it s the government using the strong arm to do something to a minority , mr read said here , 90 miles northwest of london , the warwickshire hunt , founded in the 17th century , drew more than 200 riders and more than 2 , 000 spectators far more than the usual turnout across england and wales , according to the prohunt countryside alliance , many tens of thousands more turned out at 270 places to protest the ban the government has no clue what it has hit , said rosemary featherstone , who joined the crowd in grassy open fields near this old village they have rather taken it for granted that everyone would take this lying down , but they have n't to show their opposition , they came here on saturday in tweed caps and quilted coats and waxed country jackets shiny with age , on mounts that ranged from modest ponies to sleek , towering hunters , their riders clad in tailored scarlet or black jackets and tightfitting jodhpurs , insisting that they would test the new law without deliberately breaking it technically , the new law does not prevent people from riding horses accompanied by packs of dogs , and even allows the shooting of a fox forced out of cover by a maximum of two dogs hunters may also lay a scented trail for the hounds to follow , as they did saturday at the beaufort hunt in gloucestershire , close to the country home of prince charles but the new law does not allow the same riders to set off with the intention of killing a fox and allowing a pack of hounds to do the killing the ride here in edgehill on saturday , for instance , was defined by participants as nothing more than the legal practice of exercising the hounds mind you , some said , if a fox happened across the path of the dogs , what s to be done \? we do n't intend to hunt a fox , simon jackson , the secretary of the warwickshire hunt , said from the saddle of his horse , but accidents will happen though not if the antihunting lobby had anything to do with it douglas batchelor , the chief executive of the league against cruel sports , said we greatly fear that illegal hunting will take place in the countryside today hunts are recklessly going out with hounds trained to chase foxes and hares they will need to exercise extreme caution if they are to avoid committing a criminal offense opponents call fox hunting with dogs cruel , barbaric and anachronistic no foxes , initially at least , were sighted here on saturday , but witnesses in several other places reported killings from midmorning onward , a huge open field filled up with suv s towing horseboxes and spectators and hunt followers those who accompany the hunt on foot or in cars there was just a handful of police officers in yellow slickers there to observe the hunt for infringements the ban may be difficult to enforce , and , perhaps more significantly for mr blair as elections approach , possibly in may , the prohibition has opened a social rift , pitting a view of personal freedom against the dictates of democracy we believe in the right to choose how we live our lives , said julia hodgkinson , one of the hunt s leaders this government is trying to stop that but none of the divisions are as simple as they might have seemed in 1642 when the troops supporting king charles i fought their opponents at edgehill \( a cautionary example historians have judged that an ultimately indecisive battle \) this whole saga is developing into a crisis of confidence confidence in government , confidence in our national institutions and confidence in our constitution , said john jackson , chairman of the countryside alliance the lines are blurred in other ways many country people like to argue that the fight represents an urbanrural battle , but some people in the countryside do , in fact , support the ban , according to opinion surveys some like to call it class warfare , but people here maintain that the hunt draws people from all levels there s the whole spectrum of british society , said william deakin , a huntsman here who runs a pack of 96 hounds you name a profession , and they 'll be here to some nonhunting outsiders it sounded from their accents key denominators of british class distinctions as if the posher types were on horses and the rest on foot , but even that was challenged this is what i have always done , always believed in , said anthony spencer , 31 , a sheep farmer mounted on a gleaming horse his accent did not sound at all upper crust politically , the ban has energized opponents of mr blair before the expected election many political analysts believe it also helped more radical members of mr blair s party recover from humiliation during the iraq war , when the prime minister brushed aside their opposition to his alliance with president bush for some , of course , the show of defiance on saturday may come to be seen as the beginning of the end with no quarry , there s no point , said mrs featherstone and , said mr spencer , without a steady turnout you are n't going to get the funding it s all a very vicious circle hunt advocates argue that the ban will mean unemployment among people who look after hounds and that it will not save foxes from being shot or poisoned by farmers and they maintain that it will force the hunting types to break the law the most lawabiding people are being turned into criminals , said james forsyth , a 56yearold farmer the government , he said , has turned the countryside against the townspeople as never before
uni o da floresta , brazil as soon as the dry season arrives , the loggers swing into action day after day from june onward , their empty flatbed trucks depart early in the morning from this dusty settlement along the transamazon highway , only to return starting in midafternoon , weighed down with the freshly cut trunks of ipe , jatoba and cedar trees no matter that the brazilian government last year suspended the permits required to chop down trees in this part of the jungle , making timber harvesting illegal for all but a handful of the loggers no matter either that most of the valuable tropical hardwoods being felled with chainsaws and tractors stand on public lands that , at least in theory , are off limits even to the few timber merchants who still have licenses it goes on all night long , with the traffic so intense some nights , 30 or 40 trucks thundering through , that people ca n't even sleep , said milton fernandes coutinho , president of the local farmworkers' association , which represents peasant settlers living along the roads used by the loggers we 've complained over and over again to the government , but nobody does anything to stop them brazilian government statistics suggest that widespread flouting of the law is also occurring elsewhere in the amazon despite regulations that are more rigorous , at least on paper , and repeated pledges by president luiz in cio lula da silva to crack down on those pillaging the world s largest tropical rain forest , shipments of wood from the region are booming as never before according to government figures , brazilian timber exports from the amazon increased in value nearly 50 percent in 2004 over the previous year , to just under 1 billion in the first half of this year , when the rainy season traditionally slows down activities , exports rose an additional 20 percent in value over all , nearly 40 percent of the wood cut in the amazon is now being shipped overseas , compared with only 14 percent in 1999 brazil s main markets are the united states , which accounts for onethird of all timber shipments abroad , followed by china , at 14 percent and growing rapidly , and european countries , which collectively account for 40 percent the problem , though , is that the government s own figures indicate that about 60 percent of those exports are illegal , said paulo adario , who directs the amazon campaign of the environmental group greenpeace so you have to ask yourself how is it possible that even with logging permits suspended since july 2004 , wood exports are continuing to rise so frighteningly \? advocates for peasant settlers , including labor unions and roman catholic church officials , answer by pointing to the traditional reluctance of the federal government s environmental and forestry agency , known as ibama , to act against loggers and sawmill owners the agency is chronically short of staff and money , its employees are often threatened , and neither the army nor the police are willing to provide protection to inspectors on official missions you can have a thousand laws on paper , but they do n't mean anything unless the authorities enforce them , said erwin krautler , the roman catholic bishop of the xingu region ibama officials , however , argue that they are enforcing the law more aggressively now and have begun making progress they note that seizures of illegally cut wood are up , that the volume of timber harvested has begun to drop sharply , and that for the first time ever , a timber merchant was recently jailed for logging on public land as regards issues of monitoring and enforcement , you have to look at the amazon in a broad context , jo o paulo capobianco , the agency s director of forests , said in a telephone interview from bras lia even if we were to shut off all of the exits , there would still be some places where timber would still leave illegally but there is no doubt that our performance this year has infinitely improved compared to previous years in this jungle region , however , timber trucks still roam freely and unchecked on the rutted dirt roads , with no sign of inspectors one afternoon in september , for example , a truck loaded down with logs and workers roared into town to drop off the laborers at their homes is it really necessary to take all these pictures \? one worker asked nervously when a reporter and photographer approached the truck when asked if his work crew had permits to cut timber , he replied no , we do n't have any management plan nobody here does you 're not going to tell ibama , are you \? the truck hurried off , but a few minutes later stopped at a sawmill operated by nilson samuelson , a former mayor here visible through an open gate was a truck laden with timber in a telephone interview , mr samuelson who organized a demonstration here in 2003 against ibama inspectors at which he said that we need to bring bin laden here to teach these people a lesson acknowledged that he was breaking the law and said , my activities are none of your business he also argued that economic necessity justified his actions if you 're going to bust me , you 're going to have to bust everybody , because nobody here has authorizations , he said we 're just trying to survive who is going to give me the money to pay my employees and educate my children \? what are you trying to do , have ibama wipe me out and leave 250 families without jobs \? who cares about the law \? what am i supposed to do , go hungry \? with large parts of the eastern and southern flanks of the amazon already devastated , the principal target of loggers and sawmill owners these days is the socalled terra do meio , or midlands , between the xingu and iriri rivers in fact , the area north of here , between the transamazon highway and the amazon river , is so active that local people have begun calling it iraq because the loggers are bombing the life out of it , mr coutinho of the farmworkers' association explained according to testimony in a parliamentary inquiry into the illegal timber trade , irregularities in another government program have also contributed to the recent lumber boom called legal harvest , the new program was meant to benefit poor peasants , but according to a report of the congressional committee has become an illicit fundraising device for mr da silva s workers' party the program allows thousands of peasant settler families to cut down about 75 acres of forest on their lands yearly and to sell the timber to sawmills but according to the testimony of the president of the state loggers' union , m rio rubens de souza rodrigues , loggers often simply buy certificates from peasants who have already cleared their fields and use the documents to cover up their own illegal harvesting in return , loggers and sawmill operators made large donations during the most recent national municipal elections to candidates of the governing workers' party , which at the national level is already mired in the worst corruption scandal in modern brazilian history among those named in brazilian press reports as having taken part in the timber arrangement are the new mayor here and her husband , who is a congressional deputy , and a federal senator and her former husband , the regional chief of the environmental agency the legal harvest program has been suspended , but we have no indication that indicates these allegations can be verified , said mr capobianco , the agency official in bras lia we think that the plan is the correct way to do things , and it is our intention to continue with this mechanism so long as we can assure conditions that guarantee no fraud is taking place workers' party officials also deny any involvement in improprieties related to the plan but government investigators confirm that they are examining the program and that they have found irregularities
trump tower on fifth avenue is only about 60 blocks from the wagner houses in east harlem , but they might as well be light years apart they epitomize the highest and lowestearning census tracts in manhattan , where the disparity between rich and poor is now greater than in any other county in the country that finding , in an analysis conducted for the new york times , dovetails with other new regional economic research , which identifies the bronx as the poorest urban county in the country and suggests that the middle class in new york state is being depleted the top fifth of earners in manhattan now make 52 times what the lowest fifth make 365 , 826 compared with 7 , 047 which is roughly comparable to the income disparity in namibia , according to the times analysis of 2000 census data put another way , for every dollar made by households in the top fifth of manhattan earners , households in the bottom fifth made about 2 cents that represents a substantial widening of the income gap from previous years in 1980 , the top fifth of earners made 21 times what the bottom fifth made in manhattan , which ranked 17th among the nation s counties in income disparity by 1990 , manhattan ranked second behind kalawao county , hawaii , a former leper colony with which it had little in common except for that signature grove of palm trees at the world financial center the rich in manhattan made 32 times the average of the poor then , or 174 , 486 versus 5 , 435 the analysis was conducted for the times by dr andrew a beveridge , a sociology professor at queens college of the city university of new york the growing disparity in manhattan helped drive new york from 11th among cities with the biggest income disparities in 1980 to fifth in 1990 and fourth in 2000 , behind atlanta berkeley , calif and washington , according to the analysis the gains are all going to the top , dr beveridge said it s a massive class disparity last week , the census bureau reported that even as the economy grew around the nation , incomes stagnated and poverty rates rose the bronx , with a poverty rate of 306 percent , was outranked only by three border counties in texas where living costs are lower swollen , in part , by the earnings of commuters who work in new york city , median household income among the states was highest in new jersey \( 61 , 359 \) and connecticut \( 60 , 528 \) it was 47 , 349 in new york state , also above the national median a separate analysis , being released this weekend by the fiscal policy institute in albany , warns that the middle class is being depleted while the rich are getting richer and the poor are growing in number and barely getting by more so in new york state and particularly upstate the loss of goodpaying jobs , especially in manufacturing , has meant that the 'hollowing out' of the middle of the income distribution continued at a rapid pace , the institute , a unionbacked research group , concluded it said the number of families earning between 35 , 000 and 150 , 000 declined by 50 , 000 from 2000 to 2003 while the number that earned above 150 , 000 and below 35 , 000 increased dr mark levitan , senior policy analyst for the community service society , a liberal research and advocacy group , said he did not believe the city s economy was uniquely weak , but said an increase in the poverty rate from 19 percent to 203 percent , as measured by the census s new american community survey , is fundamentally a story about stagnant wages edward wolff , a new york university economist , attributed the growing disparity to ballooning wall street incomes and declining wages for lower skilled workers though these forces are at work across the country , he said , the heavy preponderance of corporate headquarters , the financial sector and the legal sector in new york city has made the increase in the ratio of income between the top and bottom quintile more extreme than in other parts of the country jared bernstein , senior economist at the liberal economic policy institute , said the income gap , which in manhattan has historically been large , can endure indefinitely the elites , the top sliver of the income scale , can drive consumption and investment forward while the bottom half slogs along , he said if inequality had embedded within it its own seeds of destruction , it would implode sooner than later but that does n't appear to be the case many who have fallen behind have a skewed notion of their prospects for upward mobility manhattan , he said , is an amplified microcosm of conditions elsewhere in the country the income gap in manhattan was far wider than in any other county in tiny clay county , georgia , which has only 1 , 355 households and ranked second , the rich , on average , made about 38 times what the poor made compared with the poorest manhattanites , those in the top fifth are disproportionately male , nonhispanic white and married roughly equal proportions among rich and poor are immigrants , are employed by private profitmaking companies and work in sales the lowestincome census tract in the city is a triangular patch of east harlem east of first avenue and north of east 119th street , where , despite a hint of gentrification in a renovated brownstone or two , the neighborhood is dominated by the mammoth though generally welltended public housing project called the wagner houses the median household income there is 9 , 320 , most of the residents are black or hispanic and do not have high school degrees , 56 percent live below the poverty level and about one in 10 are foreign born darryl powell , a 43yearold automobile mechanic , said that most were struggling just to get by they 're trying to keep a roof over their head , he said people are trying to hold onto what they 've got sheila estep said she was facing eviction because she was working as a fulltime mother raising three sons rather than returning to her earlier jobs as an electrician , plumber and cosmetologist if i fail at my job , they 'll fail at theirs , she said sharon hammond , who sells cosmetics , said she and other tenants wished their neighborhood were better and that she had a working stove instead of a temporary hotplate in her apartment , but added everybody ca n't be rich manhattan s highestincome census tract is a sixsquareblock rectangle bounded by fifth and park avenues and east 56th and 59th streets the median household income in this mostly commercial section of east midtown is 188 , 697 \( average family income is 875 , 267 \) none of the residents identified themselves as black nearly onethird have advanced degrees and more than one in three are foreign born even there , though , the poverty rate is 16 percent the income gap , while supposedly increasing , seems to be a natural phenomenon , said the developer donald j trump , who lives in trump tower times have been good , but times have been good for many people and many classes of people i think there is a very large middle class but not in this section , by the way
a long way down by nick hornby 333 pp riverhead books 2495 one new year s eve , four people with very different reasons but a common purpose find their way to the top of a 15story building in london none of them has calculated that , on a date humans favor for acts of significance , in a place known as a local suicidejumpers' favorite , they might encounter company a long way down is the story of what happens next , and of what does n't this is hornby s fourth novel the two books that established his name fever pitch , a memoir of his obsession with the london soccer team arsenal , and his first novel , high fidelity , about a pop music obsessive named rob who mediates his messy relationship with the world through his record collection were loved for their precise , wry understanding of a certain kind of modestly privileged , emotionally clumsy heterosexual white 30something male the notion that the behavior , thought processes and manners of such people had been previously neglected in contemporary writing appears absurd , but hornby made it seem so he skillfully pinpointed habits and emotional foibles that felt hitherto undescribed but true in no way is it to belittle those insights to note that hornby might not have had to search too far afield for them fever pitch was about him , and though high fidelity was a novel , much of rob s view of the world , and in particular his relationship with music , clearly drew from hornby s \( rob s memorable discourse on the significance of how you order your record collection , for instance , directly echoed a piece of journalism hornby had written on the same subject several years earlier , and it is not a great leap from rob s endless listmaking to songbook , hornby s 2003 volume of essays about 31 beloved songs \) it might have been easy for hornby to continue in this vein , methodically mining his obsessions as fuel for further books documenting the different facets and evolution of hornbyman , but he has been more ambitious than that his second novel , about a boy , was largely from the point of view of the 12yearold referred to in its title the next , how to be good , was narrated by a female doctor whose husband is overtaken by an eccentric spiritual fervor now comes a long way down that rare and unexpected creature , a playful novel about suicide still , as hornby s orbit has widened , perhaps his deeper subject has n't changed so much after all one of hornby s strengths is his sharp sense of how completely the small idiocies and preoccupations of our lives are entwined with the big , serious stuff if his earlier books focused on that equation from one side how the way you feel about the bside of a favorite single , say , or a tepid performance by your sports team , has life and death and love and the rest wrapped up and channeled within it his latest suggest the corollary that it would be absurd to expect , when matters of life and death are in play , that the lame jokes and sloppy thinking and inappropriate cares of everyday living should somehow recede a long way down is narrated by the voices of the four wouldbe suicides martin is the wellknown presenter of a morning tv show , recently disgraced and imprisoned after having sex with a 15yearold girl maureen is an unworldly single mother who feels imprisoned by caring for a son who can neither speak nor walk nor recognize her , the product of her only sexual encounter jess is a snotty , unrestrained 18yearold girl with a politician father and a missing older sister jj is a failed american musician who delivers pizza , quotes raymond carver , oscar wilde and bob dylan to people who wo n't spot the references , claims to be suffering from a fatal disease he names ccr because it s an acronym for the band creedence clearwater revival and entertains the delusion that if he leaps with a copy of richard yates s 1961 novel , revolutionary road , in his arms , his death might bring it a wider readership from the beginning , without shortchanging the seriousness of his characters' predicaments , hornby permits himself to find uncomfortable comedy in their situation suicide is usually a solitary act the way it is typically done , you start with one person and then chip away at the numbers from there maureen and martin are the first to discover they are not alone she taps him on the shoulder \( i only wanted to ask him if he was going to be long , she explains to the reader \) their subsequent conversation , an awkward one , gives a fair sense of the book s tone 'i 'll wait until well , i 'll wait' so you 're just going to stand there and watch \? ' 'no of course not you 'll be wanting to do it on your own , i 'd imagine' 'you 'd imagine right' 'i 'll go over there' she gestured to the other side of the roof 'i 'll give you a shout on the way down' you can imagine this scene getting a good , uneasy laugh if they ever make the movie \( this seems quite likely high fidelity and about a boy were both successfully filmed , and there have already been two movie versions of fever pitch the second transposed almost unrecognizably into a world of the boston red sox , drew barrymore and jimmy fallon came out this year \) i guess some people will be offended at any proximity of humor to the act of suicide , but maybe that is precisely hornby s risky point that suicide is n't always very deep at all , or at least no more or less deep than the living that leads to it that it is just as much the province of shallow motives and poor jokes as the rest of life \( why should this surprise us \? even if suicide is the most serious decision a person can make , is n't it also , in its very essence , a supreme act of taking life lightly \? \) at its heart , a long way down is n't really about suicide itself anyway all four principal characters come down from the rooftop together and alive at least on that first evening it s more about what happens when you do n't kill yourself , and the tale hornby subsequently tells is an unusual and unpredictable one the book begins with an epigraph from the novelist elizabeth mccracken the cure for unhappiness is happiness , i do n't care what anyone says but in what follows hornby does n't confuse the simplicity of this thought with the impossibility of sometimes living it for all his light touches , he is never superficial enough to suggest that these lives that have fallen apart , in four of the millions of ways lives may do so , can easily be patched up and renewed whatever limited consolations the book s survivors find in each other , hornby resists melodramatic resolutions or glorious moments of redemption , and he does n't smuggle away or refute all the reasons his characters took with them to the rooftop where they met , the ones that urged them toward the edge rather than down to the ground the slow way , back into the world if , as a result , there s a sort of aimlessness as the book tapers toward its end , maybe it is the price of hornby s refusal to offer either cheap , grand , sentimental reasons to choose life or a retreat into a lazy bleakness , a wallowing in the pointlessness of it all it s as though he is fairly certain that life is worth living but ca n't quite find the ways to show it , or to prove it but that , i suppose , is not his predicament alone chris heath is a correspondent for gq magazine
companies often go to great lengths to help employees who fall ill on the road but what happens when a business traveler dies \? that was the predicament moog inc faced recently an employee who was attending a business conference in phoenix , hiking in the mountains with a colleague during their off time , got out of breath , had a heart attack and died , said kathy hallzientek , the travel manager for moog , an aerospace manufacturer based in east aurora , ny the typical company response is panic most companies do n't address the death of an employee in their travel policies , said caleb tiller , a spokesman for the national business travel association , a trade group for travel managers a death is something that s usually taken on a casebycase basis because it does not happen frequently as a result , businesses usually do not know what to do when it does happen who notifies the family \? who pays the hotel bill \? who ships the body home \? specialists in corporate travel safety say that more companies have started to address such questions , in part because of lingering concerns about terrorism and events like the asian tsunami i know a lot of companies that have elaborate plans for employees who get sick while they are traveling , said roy welker , the director of travel service at brigham and women s hospital in boston i'm not aware of any companies that have policies about death bruce kirby , president of the medex assistance corporation in baltimore , a provider of emergency travel assistance , says that is because dying is practically a taboo topic they do n't want to think about death , mr kirby said \( indeed , none of the companies contacted for this story would release the names of deceased employees or make their families available for comment \) at moog , only days before the hiking death , the company had signed a contract with international sos assistance inc in london , a risk management unit of aea international , which had helped set up procedures for dealing with the death of a worker we figured out what we would do just before it happened , ms hallzientek said thus , after the colleague in phoenix called moog s chief executive to report the death , ms hallzientek spoke to a doctor and a medical examiner there , made sure the employee s hotel and car rental bills were paid , and arranged through a phoenix funeral home to have his body sent home other companies have found themselves less prepared when a manufacturing manager for the black decker corporation died of a heart attack on a visit to hong kong in 2003 , no one knew what to do we did n't have a protocol , said raymond brusca , the company s vice president for benefits everybody started calling everybody there were no clearcut channels of communication the case was further complicated because the employee was a resident of britain on an assignment to china during the height of the sars epidemic chinese authorities balked at releasing the body black decker turned to medex assistance , which lobbied hong kong s governor to release the body it took 10 days to get things resolved , mr brusca said but it seemed like an eternity fortunately , most companies have the resources to handle an employee death , though they may not initially be aware of it corporate charge cards frequently offer insurance to cover some costs in the event of the death of a business travelers the policies usually cover all expenses related to returning the body , and corporations frequently carry additional insurance that helps the employee s survivors pay for funeral expenses credit card systems are sophisticated enough to pinpoint the likely location of an employee in the event of a natural disaster , according to anre williams , an executive vice president for american express s commercial card division we can tell you where your employees are , the departure dates and arrival dates and cardspending behavior patterns , he said mr williams said that feature was called into play after the asian tsunami , which left corporations scrambling to determine the fate of employees even when a company is covered by insurance and has a death policy , chaos may follow an employee s death on the job hilda paulian , the corporate travel manager for the battelle memorial institute , a research and development corporation in columbus , ohio , recalls the death of an employee in a car accident several years ago in st louis battelle s executives thought they were prepared for such an event they had even published on the company intranet an emergency response protocol that spelled out what to do if a worker died while traveling but after the accident , ms paulian remembers , everyone was trying to explore the best way to get the word out although the employee was covered by battelle s insurance and the procedure had been clearly articulated to employees , the process turned out to be less than orderly it s tough to get your hands around , because you can put these policies out , but how do you get people to read the policy \? she said mr kirby of medex assistance acknowledges that companies do not spend a lot of time pondering the possibility that corporate travelers may die on a trip instead , a majority of his clients prefer to take steps to prevent any harm to employees on the road for example , requests for beforetrip briefings on a region s culture , language and politics have more than doubled during the last year , he said bruce mcindoe , the chief executive of ijet travel risk management inc , a travel information service in annapolis , md , says companies need to face the likelihood that , sooner or later , an employee will die on business travel and if the employee is on company business , then he s the company s responsibility , he said the company has a very defined duty of care it s not something that just takes care of itself mr mcindoe said he was surprised at how unprepared most companies were for such events we 've gone in to certain companies where they thought they had a policy in place , but when you got into details , you found that they did n't , he said when you ask a company officer what the plan is , and the response is that he s not sure , then you can be relatively assured that they would n't have a clue what to do if an employee died while traveling mr welker of brigham and women s hospital suggested one alternative to a formal policy he said that corporations should consider appointing a death concierge someone who is trained in what to do in such situations the person could be put in charge of coordinating the response of various parties , from the medical examiner to the undertaker hopefully , mr welker said , it would not be a fulltime position drawing \( drawing by eric palma for the new york times \)
of all the claims of an electoral mandate made by president bush s supporters , none were as bizarre as the one offered by john yoo , a former justice department lawyer who helped draft the cynical justifications for the illegal detention and torture of unlawful combatants the debate is over , mr yoo told the new yorker , adding the issue is dying out the public has had its referendum it s hard to know what is most outrageous about those comments that mr yoo actually believes americans voted for torturing prisoners or that an official at the heart of this appalling mess feels secure enough to say that certainly the worst possibility is that the public has , indeed , lost interest the white house has done everything it can to bury the issue nearly a year after the abu ghraib scandal broke , the administration still drags its feet on public disclosure , stonewalls congressional requests for documents and suppresses the results of internal investigations but the issue is as urgent as ever hundreds of men remain imprisoned at guant namo bay , years after any information they had might have been useful and in defiance of two supreme court decisions american soldiers hold thousands of afghan and iraqi prisoners under rules that remain murky , to put it charitably american intelligence is still secretly detaining prisoners a practice that has become embarrassing enough for the central intelligence agency to fret publicly about it and the administration continues to insist that the president has an imperial right to sweep aside the law and authorize whatever he wants that includes flouting treaties that prohibit sending prisoners to other countries to be tortured that abhorrent practice has become more common since 9 11 and is reported to include sending prisoners to syria , a repressive nation counted by washington as a state sponsor of terrorism members of congress from both parties are proposing new laws on interrogations their intentions are honorable , and new legislation may be needed but drafts of these measures risk endorsing some terrible practices , as well as the idea that the president can declare himself above the law anyway , it s too soon for new laws we still do n't know what happened and who approved it but that task is now way beyond the purview of the senate armed services committee , which held important hearings on prisoner abuse republican congressional leaders have made it painfully clear that they will not hold a real investigation and no inquiry by the executive branch can be credible because the stain of prisoner abuse spreads so far the justice department ca n't do it attorney general alberto gonzales was part of the problem we strongly agree with the american bar association , which wrote to president bush on feb 1 to urge the appointment of an independent , bipartisan commission with subpoena power the bar association talked about iraqi civilians in military custody , but we believe that a panel should look at all prisoners , all detention centers and all involved government agencies only a full accounting can begin to heal the nation s image in the world , clarify the rules , punish those responsible and clear the names of the hundreds of thousands of other uniformed americans who risk their lives to preserve human dignity and the rule of law

sunny isles , fla , feb 25 within six months last year , carlos and betti lidsky bought and sold two condominiums then they bought and sold two houses they say they will clear a halfmillion dollars in profit , and none of the homes have even been built now mr lidsky , a lawyer , and his wife , a charity fundraiser , have put down a deposit on a fifth property , a 13 million condo in a highrise under construction , and are planning to sell before the deal closes , without even taking out a mortgage it is much better than the stock market , mr lidsky said this is an extraordinary , phenomenally good result in several metropolitan areas , from miami to riverside , calif , where the real estate market is white hot , rapidly rising prices are luring a growing number of ordinary people into buying and selling residences they do not intend to occupy , despite warnings from some economists that prices cannot continue to rise as steeply as they have in the last few years according to loanperformance inc , a san francisco mortgage data firm , about 85 percent of mortgages nationwide in the first 11 months of last year were taken out by people who did not plan to live in the houses themselves , up from 58 percent in 2000 in some markets , that proportion is much higher in phoenix , more than 12 percent of mortgages were taken out by investors in miami , the figure is 11 percent the national association of realtors , a trade organization that represents real estate brokers , said in a study being released on tuesday that the percentage of homes bought for investment might be as high as onequarter of the 77 million sold last year americans are treating real estate as a viable alternative to stocks and bonds , said david lereah , chief economist at the realtors association and some are buying at least two properties at a time like the day traders of the 1990 s dotcom boom , people are investing in a market that seems to just go up promoters use web sites to attract investors , promising quick profits one site , getpreconstructionprofitscom , is run by a pair of investors who offer online training for 197 on their home page , they say people can earn over 100 , 000 in six months investing in unbuilt real estate some economists say the influx of investors into the real estate market could have negative consequences investors are now seemingly buying based on the expectation that house prices are going to grow as rapidly as they have in the recent past , long into the future , said mark zandi , the chief economist at economycom , a private research group how quickly and high fixed mortgage rates rise will determine whether the speculative fever in the market just goes flat or whether it caves for now , low interest rates are helping to fuel the frenzy sometimes , homeowners borrow equity from their primary residence to finance down payments these buyers , some of whom lost money when the stock market crashed five years ago , believe real estate is a safer bet rita lawrence , a construction business owner in phoenix , has bought three houses in the last two years ms lawrence and her husband rent out two of them , and they hope to sell the third which they are buying for 195 , 000 for 249 , 000 , after a quick renovation taxes can take a sizable part of the profits in these deals investors who sell within a year of purchase face federal shortterm capital gains taxes of up to 35 percent , and 15 percent if they wait a year still , investors have been seduced by the steady upward march of house prices over the past few years since 2000 , the national median price of a house has increased by 33 percent and in the fourth quarter of last year , out of 129 metropolitan areas covered by the realtors , 62 markets showed doubledigit price rises over the same period a year earlier demand for investment properties has risen in markets with the most spectacular price increases , according to brokers as buyers were priced out of los angeles , they moved into san bernardino and adjacent riverside county , where prices rose by 35 percent last year nancy overgaag , a mortgage broker at financial 2000 in redlands , calif , said about onethird of her customers were looking to invest in real estate even in manhattan , where average sales prices topped 1 million last year , investors are piling into the market , brokers say some investment buyers are willing to rent out their properties at a monthly loss , anticipating future sales price rises dru finley and her husband , hsiaoli pan , who live in brewster , ny , bought a onebedroom condominium in battery park city in lower manhattan last summer for 499 , 000 they rent it out for 2 , 225 a month , about 1 , 000 less than their mortgage and maintenance costs the couple hope to make up the shortfall when they sell the condo in a few years it seems that real estate always goes up , in the long term , ms finley said many homeowners are tapping the paper wealth in their own homes to buy more real estate mark purnell , who manages internal technology for a software company in southern california , said the fourbedroom house he bought eight years ago in rancho santa margarita , south of los angeles , had quadrupled in value to 800 , 000 last year he took out a 150 , 000 home equity loan and , with his brother , bought three houses in phoenix mr purnell , 36 , who is renting out those houses , said he would buy more in phoenix but could not find anything so he is turning his attention to palm springs , calif his phoenix real estate agent , kim martin of re max achievers , said that investors had helped deplete inventories of available properties from about 25 , 000 this time last year to about 8 , 000 now in a backlash against speculative investing in some popular markets like phoenix and las vegas , some homebuilders now prohibit renting or selling houses for at least a year after closing as a result , investors have started to back off in las vegas , where the pace of the price rises started to ease towards the end of last year but in miami , the speculative craze is promoted in part by developers and brokers who help buyers to resell quickly brokers in miami work overtime to get their clients into vip sales events before developers start pitching buildings to the public the lidskys were heading out of town early last year when they got a call from michelle l judd , a sales associate at ocean iv , a highrise being built in sunny isles by a consortium led by the related group of florida , the same company that built the condo where they have lived since 2003 ms judd was offering to sell them a second unit , but only if they would put down a deposit that day shortly before their flight , mr lidsky drove to the sales office and without viewing any floor plans , ended up writing deposit checks totaling 159 , 380 for a 479 , 900 twobedroom condo , and an adjoining fourbedroom unit for 1 , 113 , 900 the money came from a bank line of credit not secured by their current home within three months , ms judd called again she had buyers for the twobedroom willing to pay 625 , 000 and 1425 million for the fourbedroom such getrichquick stories have increased demand for preconstruction condo units in and around miami while many buyers do intend to move in to their homes , as many as half the original buyers of some condos resell them before they are built of the 280 units at ocean iv , ms judd said , nearly 130 had resold thomas daly , a principal investor with the related group in 18 condo projects , said the company did not encourage investors but that once a project was initially sold out , the developer would help buyers resell their properties quickly to accommodate our purchasers developers of some projects do not allow buyers to resell before closing , because they fear this could artificially inflate prices one of those projects , art city , a 202unit condo complex being built in miami beach , is still attracting investors , although they are those who are willing to wait longer to sell jaime nack , a 29yearold event producer in santa monica , calif , bought a onebedroom unit at art city for 270 , 000 , financing the down payment with a second mortgage on her onebedroom condo in santa monica ms nack plans to rent out the unit for a couple of years before selling because of its proximity to the beach , i think it will be safe even if the market drops a bit , she said some real estate watchers in miami wonder whether that drop will come soon with more than 60 , 000 units in some phase of development in the miami area , the supply may be greater than the ultimate demand , said michael y cannon , managing director of integra realty resourcessouth florida , a market analyst a similar situation in 1986 sent the market spiraling , and it took seven years to recover for now , investors like the lidskys are still buying they intend to buy at least one more unit their sixth in less than a year in another condo but the couple , who acknowledged being killed in the stock market five years ago , sounded a note of caution maybe we wo n't lose money , but i just think it is not going to keep up , ms lidsky said at some point there are just going to be too many apartments in this area correction march 8 , 2005 , tuesday the dateline of a frontpage article last tuesday about growing speculation in residential real estate misstated the name of a florida city where housing prices are rising it is sunny isles beach , not sunny isles
washington , nov 21 vice president dick cheney stepped up the white house attacks on critics of the iraq war on monday , declaring that politicians who say americans were sent into battle based on a lie are engaging in revisionism of the most corrupt and shameless variety in remarks delivered at the american enterprise institute , mr cheney briefly said he considered debate over the war healthy , and he echoed president bush s recent praise of representative john p murtha , the pennsylvania democrat who has called for an early withdrawal of american troops from iraq , as a good man , a marine , a patriot but the vice president quickly made clear that after a week of criticism of mr bush on capitol hill , the white house would not relent in its campaign against critics of the war and those who say the administration manipulated the intelligence that led to it mr cheney decided last week , as the debate was intensifying , to time his speech for maximum impact by giving it on an otherwise quiet monday , the first day that congress was out of town on recess and while mr bush was traveling back to washington from a trip to asia the forum he chose is a conservative research organization at which his wife , lynne , is a senior fellow the flaws in the intelligence are plain enough in hindsight , but any suggestion that prewar information was distorted , hyped or fabricated by the leader of the nation is utterly false , mr cheney said senator john mccain put it best 'it is a lie to say that the president lied to the american people' mr mccain , the arizona republican and former north vietnamese prisoner of war , has had an offagain onagain relationship with the white house , but has supported the war and called for additional troops in iraq the vice president made clear that he was distinguishing between his personal regard for mr murtha , a vietnam veteran , and what he considered the consequences of mr murtha s proposed policies mr murtha returned to his district monday , as his constituents tried to come to grips with his new role as a war critic page a14 mr cheney said an early withdrawal from iraq would be a terrible blow to the security of the united states , and painted a bleak picture of terrorists' ambitions in iraq the terrorists believe that by controlling an entire country , he said , they will be able to target and overthrow other governments in the region , and to establish a radical islamic empire that encompasses a region from spain , across north africa , through the middle east and south asia , all the way to indonesia they have made clear , as well , their ultimate ambitions to arm themselves with weapons of mass destruction , to destroy israel , to intimidate all western countries and to cause mass death in the united states mr cheney repeated a formulation from a speech he made last week , calling the suggestion by some senators that the administration manipulated prewar intelligence dishonest and reprehensible democrats immediately rejected that characterization they also objected to mr cheney s assertion that members of congress had had access to the administration s prewar intelligence and that they concluded , as the president and i had concluded , that saddam hussein was a threat mr cheney did not mention that the administration had access to far more extensive intelligence than congress did , like the highly classified daily briefing provided for the president by the central intelligence agency even as he took issue with the administration s critics , the vice president said debate had an essential place in democracy , a point that mr bush emphasized in china on sunday this is not an issue of who s patriot and who s not patriotic , mr bush said it s an issue of an honest , open debate about the way forward in iraq mr cheney said , disagreement , argument and debate are the essence of democracy , and none of us should want it any other way in a rare personal reference , he said , for my part , i 've spent a career in public service , run for office eight times six statewide offices and twice nationally i served in the house of representatives for better than a decade , most of that time as a member of the leadership of the minority party to me , energetic debate on issues facing our country is more than just a sign of a healthy political system , it s also something i enjoy it s one of the reasons i 've stayed in this business leading democrats denounced mr cheney s remarks , issuing a pointbypoint rebuttal to the major points in his speech the vice president and this administration have a credibility problem , senator harry reid of nevada , the democratic leader , said in a statement rather than giving our troops a plan to move forward in iraq and changing their failed course , they continue to ignore the facts and lash out at those who raise legitimate questions about how the administration misused intelligence in its rush to war senator edward m kennedy , democrat of massachusetts , said in a statement , the only thing dishonest and reprehensible is the way the administration distorted , misrepresented and manipulated the intelligence to justify a war america never should have fought , adding , it defies belief that the vice president can continue to say with a straight face that congress had the same intelligence as the president and vice president had senator john kerry , the massachusetts democrat who ran against mr bush for president in 2004 , said mr cheney was still misleading america about the war mr cheney s remarks closely tracked a speech on terrorism by mr bush in tobyhanna , pa , on nov 11 , that suggested that democrats were undermining the war effort by accusing him of misleading the nation about iraq s unconventional weapons mr cheney s remarks were also similar to the prepared text of a speech that ken mehlman , the chairman of the republican national committee , was scheduled to make in chicago on monday night this kind of political doublespeak sends exactly the wrong message to our troops , to the iraqis and to our terrorist enemies , the text said the white house is waging its campaign against war critics as mr bush s approval ratings have sunk to record lows and polls have shown that he has lost credibility among voters a recent associated pressipsos poll found that 42 percent of americans viewed mr bush as honest , down from 53 percent in the beginning of the year but the white house has also tempered its initial response to mr murtha , a combat veteran who voted for the iraq war after mr murtha called last week for the pullout of 153 , 000 american troops from iraq within six months , the white house press secretary , scott mcclellan , issued an unusually critical statement declaring that mr murtha was endorsing the policy positions of michael moore and the extreme liberal wing of the democratic party administration officials now say the language was too strong , and on sunday mr bush referred to mr murtha , one of the house s most respected experts on military matters , as a fine man , a good man whose decision to call for a withdrawal of troops was done in a careful and thoughtful way

a funny thing seems to be happening to economics writing it s getting better in recent books like freakonomics and the travels of a tshirt in the global economy , economists have taken it upon themselves to explain something of how the world works they even tell little stories what interests tim harford , the author of the undercover economist , are the stories behind the myriad little transactions that take place every day do you drive to work or ride a subway \? do you buy coffee en route \? is it a highpriced , frothy variety , or something plainer \? and if it s the first kind , why is it so darn expensive , when the incremental cost of steaming a little milk amounts to only pennies \? one question that interests mr harford is what will persuade you to fork over 26 for a copy of the undercover economist \( oxford university press \) \? he seems to believe that witty , bracing prose will do the trick i would like to thank you for buying this book , but if you 're anything like me you have n't bought it at all , he begins instead , you 've carried it into the bookstore cafe and even now are sipping a cappuccino in comfort while you decide whether it s worth your money while we 're on the subject of that cappuccino , mr harford explains that starbucks would like to charge each of us exactly what we are willing to pay , but that it would simply not do for it to advertise cappuccino for the lavish , 3 , and cappuccino for the thrifty , 1 it has to be clever about it something like , hot chocolate , 220 caffe mocha , 275 20 oz cappuccino , 340 to the customer , the choice of drinks is what matters to starbucks , it is the choice of prices similarly , when disney world in florida offers discounts to people who live in the orlando area , mr harford observes , they 're not making a statement about the grinding poverty of the sunshine state they are making an educated guess that outoftowners , who visit only once in a while , are willing to pay more than people from nearby the author , a briton who lives in washington and who writes the cheeky dear economist column for the financial times , says that there is a story to tell in nearly every such interaction for instance , whole foods lures you to spend more by offering distinct and relative to what the competition offers more expensive foods it sells organic broccoli in addition to the customary industrialstrength variety , and it is careful never to display them side by side , because you would then notice the difference in price whole foods wants you to be thinking only about the incremental good health that organic broccoli presumably confers the economist s job , mr harford says , is to shine a spotlight on the underlying process sounds reasonable , but that is not what most economists actually do most professional economists are paid to predict the future this is why so much of economics writing is dull and pretty silly no one can predict the future , least of all an economist mr harford fancies himself to be more like a detective an undercover economist perhaps he is less policeman than psychologist psychologists are not much good at predictions , either , but they do help us understand behavior , and recognize what sort of social settings induce people to behave better or worse just so , mr harford s undercover op is a creature of incentives recalling that in his university days , student clubs allowed unlimited drinking in return for an upfront fee , he notes that these encouraged bingeing because the cost of each additional drink was zero what matters in terms of limiting intake is the marginal cost of each new drink so , too , with reducing automobile traffic it s not the average cost per trip that matters , but the cost of getting into your car each additional time to an economist , the truly interesting decisions are those that occur at the margin the point at which one employee more is hired , one dollar more is invested , one cappuccino \( on top of all those you have already imbibed \) is drunk mr harford explains this central concept by returning to the source namely , the classical economist david ricardo s explication of how the yield from a marginal piece of land determined rents in preindustrial england the author is good at showing how such basic concepts apply across a complex modern economy after observing that rents in london today are higher thanks to the surrounding green belt , which cuts off development , he notes that as an undercover economist , you start to see 'green belts' of one kind or another all over the place for instance , professional associations that restrict entry into , say , medicine serve as green belts that shield doctors from competition none of this is the least bit unconventional though the author enjoys being politically incorrect \( sweatshops are good news , he offers tartly \) , he is not economically incorrect in fact , lively presentation aside , he has written a pretty standard primer , one that defends free markets to a fault and attacks government as the source of just about everything bad predictably , he says that the best way to limit pollution is through freemarket incentives he then goes overboard by suggesting that environmental debates are mere moral posturing yet without some discussion first , it is unlikely that we would have developed any incentives and some of his arguments are far too brief to carry their intended weight the author cannot really expect to explain why poor countries are poor in a single chapter , the highlight of which is an interview with a cabdriver in cameroon a final criticism is that too many of mr harford s interesting details lack a source or a footnote he gets amazon s stockprice history wrong \( the author says that during the dotcom bust , it fell below its initial offering price adjusting for splits , it never did \) many other details lack the specificity or the attribution to enable one to check but these are quibbles for those of you , even now , still stuck in the bookstore cafe , this is a book to savor
george steinbrenner has a voice of his own , a once clangorous one , but when he wants to convey his thoughts to a needy news media these days , it is invariably through the tranquil voice of howard j rubenstein it is an act of verbal surrogacy that rubenstein , a publicrelations impresario with 450 clients , performs almost daily for steinbrenner , the principal owner of the yankees as he nears his 75th birthday on monday , steinbrenner continues to limit contacts with the news media and tries to avoid the posse of reporters who wait for shreds of comment after home games at yankee stadium rubenstein would never say that he is a substitute steinbrenner deference to a major , demanding client would preclude such a dismissible offense but he is the primary conduit to a man who still seems to have something to say but who has an increasingly limited desire to say it publicly so call rubenstein the stunt boss he made up his mind a couple of years ago that he does n't want to shoot from the hip as often , rubenstein said during an interview over lunch in his midtown office on wednesday 'you shoot from the hip , you hit your foot , ' he said so it was last monday , with the 200 million yankees continuing to play poorly , that rubenstein issued the latest motivational message from his distressed client the players have to want to win as much as i do , said steinbrenner , via rubenstein the day before , there was rubenstein again , a former brooklyn dodgers fan , telling reporters that what will happen to the team is in joe torre s lap two weeks earlier , rubenstein was alerting everyone that joe torre s job is safe rubenstein said he was a faithful servant to steinbrenner s sentiments , even if he said that he had advised steinbrenner to tame some unvarnished words with gentler ones it would have been easy for me to say , 'heads will roll , ' rubenstein said but when i said , 'it s in torre s lap , ' george had never said anything remotely like , 'heads will roll ' a major benefit of having rubenstein talk to all of the reporters seeking comment from steinbrenner is that more time and thought are given to what statement will eventually be attributed to the yankees' owner , even if the final result usually lacks steinbrenner s old fire is the public steinbrenner blander than good old boisterous george \? sure , said rubenstein , who first did work for steinbrenner in the mid1980 s when he was shooting from the hip , the bullets resounded behind the scenes , he s still feisty , but he thinks this is a better tactic rubenstein denied that any illness had prompted steinbrenner to rely on him so heavily the muted steinbrenner symbolizes the virtual end of bluster among team owners in the new york area steinbrenner used to supply most of it , but some of it also came from nelson doubleday , who later sold his half of the mets to fred wilpon meanwhile , wilpon , while never uproarious , is now nearly as quiet as woody johnson , the jets' owner john mcmullen used to inject curmudgeonly gusto into the sports pages , but he sold the new jersey devils to yankeenets , which broke apart and sold the hockey team to jeff vanderbeek , a former investment banker who has yet to exhibit bluster so everything has quieted down in new york , and people outside new york are noticing the frequency of steinbrenner s statements arriving in rubenstein s voice prompted the boston globe columnist bob ryan , a guest panelist on the espn program pardon the interruption on wednesday , to suggest , halfhumorously , that something was amiss it s a 'wizard of oz' deal at the very least , he said there s a guy behind the curtain rubenstein is a reserved , yet confident , image consigliere at 73 , he is perhaps the most renowned publicrelations practitioner in new york city his clients include rupert murdoch larry silverstein , the developer who holds the lease on the world trade center site the tribeca film festival and columbia university he has become a loyal yankee man his grandsons were batboys at yankee stadium one day in 2002 there are pictures of steinbrenner around rubenstein s roomy office \( one picture signed by steinbrenner calls rubenstein a true friend , trusted adviser and genius ! \) , and at no time , he said , has he had harsh words with steinbrenner i 'd ride the rapids with him , rubenstein said i might have to do the rowing , but he would n't throw me over no client takes up more of his time than steinbrenner , usually two hours a day , he said rubenstein s yankee days begin early , with calls with randy levine , the yankees' president , and then with steinbrenner rubenstein speaks to steinbrenner two or three times a day , depending on what must be responded to the discussions with george are pretty much the same , rubenstein said he says , 'have you looked at the papers and tv \? what are they saying \? is there anything we have to respond to \? ' i 'll ask what s going on on the corporate level yesterday , they discussed the coverage of right fielder gary sheffield s angry statements on wednesday night , when he reacted to trade rumors by strongly suggesting he would be a divisive presence wherever he might be dealt as steinbrenner speaks , rubenstein takes notes \( none of which he has saved for posterity , the baseball hall of fame or a sotheby s auction \) rubenstein said that during the conversations , he might suggest a more politic way to react when reporters call rubenstein for a steinbrenner reaction , as they always do , 12 or 15 times almost every day he will read his handwritten notes back to steinbrenner several times a week , particularly knotty issues require afternoon conference calls that involve rubenstein steinbrenner levine lonn trost , the team s chief operating officer and sometimes general manager brian cashman we 're always checking the news flow , rubenstein said i read the wires on tuesday , rubenstein was monitoring the meeting in tampa , fla , of steinbrenner , levine , cashman and other yankee officials reporters knew the meeting was occurring , and anticipated the possible firings of some coaches i said to his secretary , you ca n't let that meeting break without george saying something , rubenstein said in reference to steinbrenner so he called me at 4 30 or 5 and said all he wanted to say was , 'we had good meetings today and some of us will meet again tomorrow ' the words , he said , went verbatim into an emailed statement that concluded with one personal ad lib howard rubenstein declined further comment rubenstein seems to maintain an extra level of readiness , as if a yankee crisis were always imminent during wednesday s interview , he reached into the inside pocket of his suit jacket and removed index cards with the names of yankee beat reporters and other writers , with their phone numbers and email addresses when , he was asked , was the last true yankee crisis \? i do n't know , he said , with a chuckle it s every day on rubenstein s right ring finger is his 1998 world series ring , one of four he has received as part of steinbrenner s inner circle he is somewhat more than a hired hand he owns less than 1 percent of yankee global enterprises , the holding company for the yankees and their stake in the yes network rubenstein s two decades of work for steinbrenner indicates a level of satisfaction but rubenstein said he would not ask steinbrenner to comment on the quality of his work as steinbrenner s public monologist that s too selfserving , rubenstein said if i asked him , he 'd say , 'what , are you crazy \? you 'll know what to say ' so if he had to comment , as steinbrenner s spokesman , on the work that he does as steinbrenner s spokesman , what would he say \? no comment , he said , and laughed loudly
san francisco by almost every measure the spreading disaster of hiv infection and aids , the vast suffering caused by malaria the world is failing to meet the health needs of its poorest people yet in the world of public health , there is a growing mood of cautious optimism and commitment based on a novel way of approaching these problems one that does not rely on western governments in the west , and in developing countries , people and organizations are using proven business strategies to devise workable solutions this social entrepreneurship is transforming global public health consider the longstanding problem that developing countries have faced in obtaining affordable , effective drugs the profitmaking pharmaceutical business model that works well in generating effective treatments for many diseases in the developed world does n't work at all for diseases limited to people who have little or no money yet it has produced drug leads that could treat and even cure some of the worst diseases that afflict the world s poorest people these promising leads are languishing because companies ca n't justify the enormous costs involved in turning them into therapies that wo n't return a profit , or even research and development investments thus with few exceptions , the pharmaceutical industry has abandoned research on drugs to treat tropical parasitic diseases in one case , there had been good evidence that paromomycin , a drug that was first developed 50 years ago as a broadspectrum antibiotic , would be effective against black fever \( visceral leishmaniasis \) black fever afflicts as many as 15 million people in the developing world , killing about 200 , 000 of them annually yet the final stages of development for paromomycin were not completed because the drug was no longer being manufactured champions of the drug in kenya , sudan and india ensured that paromomycin was not forgotten because the patent had expired , my organization , the institute for oneworld health , in partnership with the international dispensary association in amsterdam and the world health organization , was able to take paromomycin through the final stages of development without provoking the kind of opposition that , for example , the brazilian government did with its decision in june to produce a generic version of a patented antiretroviral that aids patients in that country desperately need following rigorous testing with guidance from the indian government , we intend to begin delivery of paromomycin in 2006 in south asia another nonprofit organization , the drugs for neglected diseases initiative in geneva , will bring paromomycin to africa paromomycin wo n't make anyone rich , but it will save lives and alleviate hideous suffering for efforts like this to continue to succeed in addressing global health inequities between the richest and poorest , the world needs new business models there needs to be a more flexible way of addressing intellectual property that encourages and protects innovation yet makes the advances of modern medicine available to most of humanity unused intellectual property drugs , diagnostics and other medical technologies can be reinvigorated and reinvestigated to ease suffering and save lives but people are the most important factor none of these recent successes would have been possible without shared research and the contributions of skilled volunteers from the pharmaceutical field and other professions yet it s difficult to take time away from a demanding job as a scientist or financial planner or doctor to do the volunteer work that makes these new approaches possible what if it were n't \? just as law firms set aside resources for pro bono work , there should be a systematic way for people from the world s most successful companies to contribute their time and expertise to advance global health imagine a kind of peace corps for pharmaceutical professionals today , public health is primarily a government responsibility while we do need governments for implementation and scale , we need to encourage individuals and corporations to bring fresh ideas and especially , we need to tap innovative social entrepreneurs like govindappa venkataswamy , an indian doctor who turned an 11bed clinic into the largest eye care facility in the world , and vera cordeiro , a brazilian doctor who is building a health care system to prevent recurring illnesses in poor children these entrepreneurs use the classic strategies of a startup business product innovation , efficiency improvements and a keen understanding of the customer to find new solutions to the challenge of improving health we have the means to help millions of people attain better health and escape poverty we 'll get there faster by creating innovative solutions and making legal and logistical space for these approaches to flourish oped contributor victoria hale is founder and chief executive of the institute for oneworld health , a nonprofit pharmaceutical company
the harold lloyd comedy collection the four dvd s \( three with double sides \) that make up the harold lloyd comedy collection contain a hefty chunk of the creative life of the silent era s most

it s an inexhaustible anthology , and one that belongs in any serious dvd collection though lloyd is now reflexively mentioned as one of the big three of silent film comedy , alongside charlie chaplin and buster keaton , he is just as automatically undervalued , most likely because he seems to lack the dark side that so profoundly accents the humor of his two peers lloyd is the silent film s great singer of youth , energy and optimism , whose most famous character the boy with the straw hat and hornrimmed glasses embodied america s sense of itself in the 1920 s , the decade that saw a great industrial boom and the country s transformation from a rural to an urban society lloyd may have been the great american gogetter , but as his films quietly but consistently suggest , it is a position that comes with a large share of anxiety in safety last \( 1923 \) , lloyd s most famous film and the one that opens this collection , he is a young man from the sticks who goes to the big city to make good , at which point he plans to send for his hometown sweetheart \( mildred davis , whom lloyd married in real life \) his climb to the top is visualized as just that as a publicity stunt for the department store where he works as a humble clerk , he is forced to scale all 12 floors of its granite exterior and has a fateful encounter with the hands of a giant clock it is one of the

after 18 years in office , alan greenspan will hand over the chairmanship of the federal reserve to ben s bernanke early next year probably no other single event in 2006 is more likely to affect the future economy than that change based on their writings , what might they say to each other in private if either were to let his guard down \? date wed 01 feb 2006 09 10 to ag yahoocom from benbernanke frbgov dear al , wow ! i just arrived for my first day at work , and i'm sitting right at your desk in your old inner sanctum needless to say , it s a bit daunting to take over the most powerful economic job in the world especially when your predecessor is revered as an omniscient oracle just a quick question i found the keys to your desk , but where are all your secret formulas \? i looked in all your drawers , and every one of them is empty to benbernanke frbgov from ag yahoocom dear ben , actually , i took my secrets and plan to publish them in a bestselling book you wo n't believe the advance i'm getting i'm kidding , benny ! you know i love to kid you but take my advice do n't get locked into models and rules the economy is too complex to be captured by any model and changing too much to be nailed down by any rule i like models , but i like them mainly when they go wrong the real breakthroughs come from looking at anomalies , the things that defy the conventional wisdom and hint that something new is happening there was no model in the 1990 s that said that productivity had accelerated and that the economy could grow much faster than anyone thought possible that s why i was at odds for years with much of the senior fed staff they believed their models more important , you have to protect your flexibility remember the russian financial meltdown in 1998 \? at the time , the standard models were telling us to raise rates but the russian crisis kicked off a panic in the bond markets , and risk premiums shot up around the world so instead of raising rates , we cut them the result a crisis was contained , the markets calmed down and inflation was none the worse have to run my seniors' tennis group plays on wednesday mornings to ag yahoocom from benbernanke frbgov dear al , to be honest , i think you 're being unfair yes , i admit i spent most of my career as an academic at princeton and yes , i have argued that central banks should be less personalized and more focused on a consistent and measurable objective but i'm not some kind of ivorytower robot , preprogrammed with rigid rules and mechanistic models the difference between you and me is smaller than you think take your bugaboo about inflation targeting i say the fed should base monetary policy on an explicit inflation target between 1 and 2 percent you say that would rob the fed of the wiggleroom excuse me , the flexibility that it needs but you and the other traditionalists are attacking a caricature the inflation target is a longterm objective , not a monthbymonth rule i'm not going to kick off an air raid siren the moment consumer prices take an unexpected jump look at this year s spike in oil and gas prices , which pushed the consumer price index up by well over 3 percent even though i am an inflationtargeter , i would argue that energy prices were not in themselves a cause for inflation worries what really matters is not a onetime spike in prices , but whether people believe prices will remain stable over the long run if they do , the overall inflation rate will settle back down once the energy shock is absorbed , without the fed having to take drastic action on its own in fact , i would argue that the fed probably erred in the 1970 s by overreacting to higher oil prices it was the fed s overreaction , more than the oil prices , that sent the economy into a recession to benbernanke frbgov from ag yahoocom i'm running off to my canasta game at volcker s place but if you 're so flexible , why bother setting a target at all \? to ag yahoocom from benbernanke frbgov to be transparent ! did n't anybody tell you the dark ages are over \? once upon a time , it was fine for the fed to say nothing at all to the public not even that it had raised or lowered the fed funds rate but those days are long gone financial markets around the world watch what we do every minute , and confusion about our goals and methods creates unnecessary disruption in fairness , you made the fed vastly more open than it was under paul volcker you not only began announcing decisions , you offered explanations and even guidance about decisions months in the future but there is still a long ways to go if investors understand our longterm goal , and understand how we think it has to be achieved , they can anticipate our policies and have more confidence about the future to benbernanke frbgov from ag yahoocom oh , puhleeze i have an inflation target , which is basically about two percent a year anybody who cared could figure it out , just by looking at what we did the difference is that i never admitted it in public why did n't i \? because i did n't want to be forced into a straitjacket and i did n't want people snapping at my heels if the cpi was running hot for a month or two your refinements about inflation targets are elegant , but you will have a quite a time explaining them all to the public where do you start \? that you have an inflation target , but not for this year \? that your inflation target does n't include gasoline and food \? the more you reveal , the more you have to explain and the more you can be misunderstood and you wo n't be the only one explaining you have six other fed governors and the presidents of 12 regional fed banks your policy might even be less transparent , to use your favorite word , than mine meanwhile , i defy you to generate greater confidence and credibility on your watch than i did on mine to ag yahoocom from benbernanke frbgov as i said at my senate confirmation hearing , i am going to take all this very slowly and only after building a consensus within the fed i know full well that governor donald kohn is solidly against my approach , but a lot of other fed governors and bank presidents are on board this is the way of the future just look at the bank of england , the bank of canada , the european central bank and the bank of new zealand how was your canasta game , by the way \? are you going to take up shuffleboard too \? to benbernanke frbgov from ag yahoocom oh , right how could we possibly lag the bank of new zealand \? but i would n't cite the european central bank as a model mechanistic or otherwise eurozone inflation is about the same as that of the united states , but growth is about half as fast meanwhile , let me tell you something about transparency it can get you into trouble the more you reveal , the more you need consensus inside the fed people often accused me of being a behindthescenes autocrat , but i 've had plenty of serious disagreements with other fed governors wayne angell said i was too restrictive in the late 1980 s larry meyer thought i was too easy in the mid90 s at least we did n't have to explain the nuances or fed targets and forecasts but what are you going to do when you face similar disagreements and everybody is supposed to be more open \? my prediction mixed messages , confusion and uncertainty if i were you , i would learn how to be delphic and inscrutable as fast as possible here s another problem , benny ifyou are explicit about your goals , you also have to be more explicit about your forecasts but as robert barbera of itghoenig said , forecasting is a black art and even the best of us are often wrong being wrong in private is an occupational hazard being wrong in public can weaken a crucial element of the fed s power its aura of infallibility ps do n't knock shuffleboard until you 've tried it
scarborough , me , july 15 four months before enrollment begins , the bush administration has started a crosscountry campaign to sell its most significant domestic policy initiative , the new medicare drug benefit but it is encountering skepticism from some consumers , whose participation is critical to the program s success in a stop here , four top bush administration officials , including the surgeon general of the united states , said the drug benefit would be a boon to retirees , worth 1 , 300 a year to a typical recipient and much more to those with low incomes but the officials offered none of the details that would have allowed beneficiaries to judge for themselves crucial information , like the monthly premiums and the names of covered drugs , will not be available until midseptember after hearing federal officials praise the program for about 45 minutes , joan m jenness , 72 , of bridgton , me , said i heard nothing i had not heard before i still have lots of questions everyone enrolled in medicare is eligible for prescription drug coverage but public opinion polls suggest that many people have not heard about the new benefit or do not understand it , and many have not decided whether to sign up for it the economics of the new program depend on the assumption that large numbers of relatively healthy people will enroll and pay premiums , to help defray the costs of those with high drug expenses insurers say the new program cannot survive if the only people who sign up are heavy users of prescription drugs that is why president bush flew to minnesota last month to open a national education and outreach tour , and why other officials have taken the message to florida and south carolina this week s bus tour rolled into maine , new hampshire , massachusetts and rhode island with a twofold purpose to educate consumers and to galvanize community groups , which are needed to help people enroll the campaign is headed for chicago , milwaukee , indianapolis , cincinnati and dayton , ohio , next week on tuesday , more than 30 organizations plan to announce a coordinated national effort , including a television advertising campaign , to disseminate information on the medicare drug benefit the organizations include aarp and groups representing doctors , pharmacists , insurance companies and people with chronic diseases federal officials face a huge task in trying to educate the 42 million medicare enrollees about a drug benefit that differs radically from the traditional feeforservice program in this portland suburb , that challenge was on display people who said they were healthy said they saw no immediate need to buy the medicare drug coverage people who said they were ill said the benefit seemed meager and local insurance counselors said they shuddered at the complexity of the program officials arrived in a big blue bus painted with the message that people could sign up for the drug benefit on nov 15 , for coverage beginning on jan 1 dr mark b mcclellan , administrator of the federal centers for medicare and medicaid services , explained why federal officials were here what matters most , dr mcclellan said , is not what happens in washington , but what happens all over the country as people make decisions about their health care and prescription drug coverage in deciding whether to sign up for the drug benefit , people will want to evaluate whether they will be getting their money s worth that depends , in part , on how much they currently spend on drugs health policy specialists say the new benefit will generally be a good deal for lowincome people , who are entitled to extra subsidies , and for people with drug costs exceeding 5 , 100 a year , since medicare will pay about 95 percent of the cost of each prescription beyond that point people who have solid drug coverage from other sources , like a former employer or the veterans' health program , may not see a need to sign up immediately for the medicare drug benefit maine is a good state in which to sample public sentiment about the benefit about 18 percent of residents , 239 , 000 of 13 million , are on medicare concern about drug costs figures prominently in state politics because maine is on the canadian border , residents have ready access to information on drug prices in canada in addition , maine has been a leader in devising state programs to reduce drug costs it defended one such program all the way to the united states supreme court the event here was held at the southern maine agency on aging , a nonprofit organization that offers counseling and other services federal officials are counting on such agencies to help beneficiaries select drug plans as he welcomed visiting officials on wednesday , laurence w gross , executive director of the agency , described the drug benefit as one of the most important changes in medicare in 35 years but mr gross has yet to persuade his mother , lisette v debruycker i'm betwixt and between , said ms debruycker , 81 i do n't take any medications aside from an occasional aspirin what will the new program do for me \? richard e robbins , 72 , said he would probably sign up , although he uses only a few hundred dollars' worth of drugs in a year it s a nobrainer , he said the drug coverage is a safety net we never know from day to day what our needs will be many democrats adamantly opposed the drug bill when republicans pushed it through congress in 2003 democrats denounced the measure as a giveaway to drug companies and insurers but gov john baldacci of maine , a democrat , is working with the bush administration to help people enroll this is not the drug benefit we would have designed , said jude e walsh , the governor s top adviser on pharmacy programs but we have no choice it s coming whether we want it or not we are trying to make it work for vulnerable people in the state of maine the officials who barnstormed through new england called themselves the four docs besides dr mcclellan , those visiting were surgeon general richard h carmona julie l gerberding , director of the centers for disease control and prevention and elias a zerhouni , director of the national institutes of health in establishing the drug benefit , congress and mr bush are trying to inject market forces into the traditional medicare program under the law , medicare will subsidize drug coverage offered by private insurers if it is at least as generous as a standard benefit defined by congress private plans can charge different premiums and

the new broom from brooklyn , as the tabloids pegged him in 1986 when he performed an emergency sanitization of new york city s scandalridden parking violations bureau , revels in his nickname he also revels in taming emergencies by dint of his management skills , not brawn a savvy tactic , since at 140 pounds , this perpetual brooklynite \( he still lives in the house he grew up in \) boasts no brawn but he wields a mean broom along with a law degree from st john s the inner pugnacity stems , he guesses , from being the son of a city patrolman who put in 35 years and was still on active duty when he died joseph f bruno s walls at the brooklynbased office of emergency management , where he is both the commissioner and an author of new york city s fledgling citywide incident management system \( cims \) a protocol that coordinates the response of city agencies to catastrophic events are all but obscured by framed clippings and commemorative plaques from his glory days as a designated repairman for the koch administration it was rotten , but not to the core , he recalls of the parking bureau , where his first day on the job was highlighted by a padlocked executive office and the presentation of 25 subpoenas to be served on his new underlings by an unfriendly federal bureau of investigation team when mr bruno hemmed and hawed that he was n't the right middleman , not to mention this was a terrible way to get acquainted with his staff , the fbi offered , he says , to make it 26 subpoenas no wonder his wife , joanne , had told him he should have stuck with his job as first deputy fire commissioner instead of agreeing , on the spot , to handle ed koch s dirty work he caved and cooperated the fbi distributed 25 subpoenas welcome to the parking violations bureau park carefully he spent two years restructuring the bureau and plumping up its revenues before mayor edward i koch rewarded him with a promotion to fire commissioner in 1987 the parking violations bureau gave me a real management job , a chance to show what i could do on my own , take an agency that was maligned and change the way it operated , he says , seated at a round table in the waterside warehouse serving as temporary headquarters for emergency management , whose operations center at the world trade center was destroyed on sept 11 , 2001 mr bruno , now 61 , had risen to state supreme court justice after 14 years on the bench , when mayor michael r bloomberg s chief of staff , peter madonia , called early in 2004 to gauge his interest in running the office of emergency management at first blush , he had none after a meeting with the mayor , he reconsidered , slowly , with many flashbacks to sept 11 and colleagues lost the only reason i would want to do it is because it s an important job , he says of the commissionership , which pays 172 , 000 annually ed koch always said public service is the finest thing you can do , if you do it honestly it sounds trite , but it s true he found the judiciary compelling he figures he issued close to 1 , 800 decisions and was managing the calendar for more than 5 , 000 cases but insular he could have retired there , but did n't wish to here was a chance to get back into the management world and take this agency to another level , make the agency as relevant as we can there s nothing more important right now in government than preparedness and planning for the safety of citizens it s not all about terrorism it s about managing disasters , natural or manmade but 9 11 tells you it s important on sept 11 , the agency had no backup system now it does , along with a mobile unit we are triply redundant , he says the office of emergency management also emerged as the referee in the jurisdictional duel between the police and fire departments with its cims protocol , mr bruno says , the office provides real direction as to who s in charge it s a logical program that does n't subjugate one agency to another , he continues yes , it says the pd is in charge unless it s determined that the event was n't caused by a crime or terrorism , which is the case most of the time but if it is the case , pd should be in charge mr bruno acknowledges , but does not condone , the rumble of outrage from some sectors of the fire department i 've been around these two departments a long time they 're both very chesty , very macho organizations you want them to be aggressive but i do think this is a matter of perception , and maybe ego the cims system allows fire to do all the work it has always done it s the ultimate in interoperability he envisions a cimsled truce between the departments that may be pie in the sky , though when mr bruno was fire commissioner , his tiffs with benjamin a ward , mayor koch s police commissioner , received news media coverage fitting of heavyweight bouts in may 1988 , after they squabbled over the respective abilities of their scuba rescue squads , mr koch ordered them to shake hands and make up publicly in private , he was furious at mr bruno for goading the more emotional and much larger mr ward after all three left city hall , mr koch convened a reunion luncheon it did not , mr bruno says , take long before he rankled mr ward he told me , 'you have n't changed a bit ! you 're still a type a personality ! ' as in 1988 , it took mr koch , himself a triple a personality , to restore order lunch resumed without incident

, was gadding about both hollywood and the aviation world manohla dargis 'beyond the sea' starring kevin spacey , kate bosworth and john goodman directed by mr spacey \( pg13 , 118 minutes \) the matching of two slithery chameleons , the singer bobby darin \( who died in 1973 at the age of 37 \) and his latterday doppelg \? er , mr spacey \( now 45 \) , sparks a weird bluish flame that suggests a wax yule log posing as wood in the season s teeming fireplace of movie biographies when ignited , it releases acrid , waxy fumes that feel queasily chemical the movie , which the star directed and helped write and in which he sings \( wonderfully \) , smacks of the same kind of obsession that brought bob fosse s all that jazz to creepy reptilian life its vision of show business in the 50 s and 60 s is as tawdry as fosse s and as incisive in suggesting it s a grubby ragstoriches circus stephen holden 'closer' starring natalie portman , jude law , julia roberts and clive owen directed by mike nichols \( r , 110 minutes \) four characters in search of an objective correlative for their needy , angry , compulsive states of feelings mr nichols s smooth , nimble direction improves patrick marber s verbose , pretentious play yet exposes some of its flaws two american women \( ms portman and ms roberts \) are entangled with two englishmen \( mr law and mr owen \) in a fourhanded game of deception , selfdelusion and betrayal that skips and leaps over a period of several years the formal trickiness of the narrative strips the characters of any daily context that would give their emotions meaning , and the movie is a succession of scenes , some quite powerful on their own , that do n't really add up to much the actors work hard to give their schematic , overwritten roles some nuance and individuality , but only mr owen raw , brash and witty succeeds a o scott 'coach carter' starring samuel l jackson , rob brown and rick gonzalez directed by thomas carter \( pg13 , 137 minutes \) in this solid , unsurprising instpirationalcoach drama , mr jackson plays ken carter , who returns to his old high school in the tough northern california city of richmond to turn a squad of underachieving misfits into winners , both on and off the court based on a true story , the movie combines sportspicture suspense with heroiceducator uplift when carter , dismayed that his players are slipping academically , padlocks the gym in the midst of an undefeated season mr carter \( the director , no relation to the coach \) infuses this sentimental warhorse with some flourishes of realism , which are bolstered by the hiphop soundtrack and by the performances of the younger cast members , especially mr brown , as a talented forward struggling with his responsibilities , ashanti as his girlfriend and mr gonzalez as a player sliding toward a life of crime scott 'elektra' starring jennifer garner , terence stamp , kirsten prout , goran visnjic , caryhiroyuki tagawa and will yun lee directed by rob bowman \( pg13 , 96 minutes \) the latest hollywood movie to give comic books a bad name , elektra stars ms garner as a superheroine who dons fetishwear the color of blood before laying waste to every man in sight your parents must have had a sense of humor , the broodingly handsome and plucky love interest says to elektra about her mythopoetic name she answers in the negative no they did not and neither does she this chick may have a complex \( or two \) , but like the rickety vehicle supporting her and the hopes of marvel comics , she emphatically does not have a sense of humor what she emphatically does have and this of course is the entire point of elektra is a hot bod and a costume that looks as if it was designed by someone very familiar with the victoria s secret catalog dargis 'fat albert' starring kenan thompson and kyla pratt directed by joel zwick \( pg , 93 minutes \) one of the truisms of contemporary pop culture is that just when you think it could n't get any worse , its purveyors any more shameless , you are proved decisively wrong based on bill cosby s corpulent charmer and his band of brothers , the fat albert movie opens just days after the release of the dvd compilations of the original show dvd s for the program are featured so prominently in the movie and the movie feels so much like an extendedplay sitcom , i half expected mr cosby to pop up onscreen to sell me the discs along with a coke from 1972 through 1984 , the animated television series fat albert and the cosby kids enjoyed enormous success the cartoon was austere but eminently watchable and featured one of those sitcom tunes that etch a permanent groove in your head just as memorable was mr cosby s bassoprofundo delivery of fat albert s trademark hey , hey , hey , a mantra that signaled that no matter what happened , all would be right in the end in fat albert , that trademark is resurrected to depressingly diminished ends dargis 'hotel rwanda' starring don cheadle , sophie okonedo , joaquin phoenix and nick nolte directed by terry george \( pg13 , 121 minutes \) this wrenching political thriller performs the valuable service of lending a human face to an upheaval so savage it seemed beyond the realm of imagination when news of it filtered to the west the movie certainly is n't the first screen depiction of a nation consumed by ethnic strife but its vision of the slaughter of 800 , 000 tutsis by the ruling hutu tribe in rwanda during a 100day bloodbath in 1994 offers a devastating picture of mediadriven mass murder left unchecked the story is based on the reallife experiences of paul rusesabagina \( mr cheadle \) , the softspoken hutu manager of the hotel des mille collines , in kigali , who with his tutsi wife , tatiana \( ms okonedo \) , and children , narrowly escapes death several times mr rusesabagina was directly responsible for saving the lives of more than 1 , 200 tutsis and hutu moderates by sheltering them in the hotel and bribing the hutu military to spare them the movie , which is squeamish about showing the full extent of savagery , hammers every button on the emotional console holden 'in good company' starring dennis quaid , topher grace and scarlett johansson written and directed by paul weitz \( pg13 , 106 minutes \) this gently revisionist fairy tale about good versus evil is set on the battlefield of contemporary corporate culture , a site of our leading blood sport mostly , though , the movie is about men the two men at the story s engaging center are carter duryea \( mr grace \) , a young executive who has been promoted beyond his abilities to run the advertising department of a magazine with the resonant name of sports america the man whom carter is meant to make redundant is the 51yearold dan foreman , a ruggedly appealing adult who brings out the best in everyone dan has a pictureperfect family and is the kind of unabashedly oldfashioned masculine type mr quaid has been slowcooking to perfection over the years and which , on american screens at least , has lately gone missing dargis 'lemony snicket s a series of unfortunate events' starring jim carrey , liam aiken , emily browning , kara hoffman and shelby hoffman directed by brad silberling \( pg , 108 minutes \) since the publication of the first installment in lemony snicket s \( a k a daniel handler s \) charmingly malignant book cycle a series of unfortunate events , the three baudelaire children violet , klaus and sunny have been trying to find safe harbor in a world fraught with danger for 11 consecutive books , the children have passed from the care of one wellintentioned adult to another , braving the sort of peril usually faced by silentscreen heroines named pauline and leaving a trail of corpses in their wake to date , the cause of their misfortunes has been their onetime guardian , count olaf , who hopes to steal their fortune but now the characters have embarked on one of the most dangerous adventures known in literature their story has been turned into a major hollywood movie and with jim carrey , no less dargis 'the life aquatic with steve zissou' starring bill murray , owen wilson , cate blanchett , anjelica huston , willem dafoe and jeff goldblum directed by wes anderson \( r , 118 minutes \) more elaborate whimsy from mr anderson , who confected a paralleluniverse manhattan in the royal tenenbaums and who now goes even further , inventing tropical islands and species of exotic fish when the mood strikes him somehow , though , this movie is more charming than irritating , partly thanks to mr murray s performance a tour de force of comic minimalism as steve zissou , an ocean adventurer with a boatload of problems the life aquatic is thick with potential narrative complications involving , for starters , zissou s longlost son \( mr wilson \) , estranged wife \( ms houston \) , slimy archrival \( mr goldblum \) and needy first mate \( mr dafoe \) but mr anderson is less a storyteller than a curator of odd specimens and curious situations scott 'a love song for bobby long' starring john travolta and scarlett johansson directed by shainee gabel \( r , 119 minutes \) in this first feature directed by ms gabel , mr travolta delivers a hammedup scenerychewing variation of the brainy good ol' boy he played in primary colors this is the story of a downattheheels former star professor and his prot \? rotting in the new orleans house bequeathed them by a legendary folkblues singer and their partial redemption when the singer s alienated daughter comes to live with them the film dawdles along aimlessly for two hours before coming up with a final revelation that is no surprise the movie s hokey solemnity suggests the mundane secrets of the yaya brotherhood or the notebook goes to the big easy the movie is another example of hollywood going soft and squishy when it goes south holden 'meet the fockers' starring robert de niro , ben stiller , dustin hoffman , barbra streisand , blythe danner , teri polo and owen wilson directed by jay roach \( pg13 , 114 minutes \) like meet the parents , the followup new comedy meet the fockers hinges on the welltraveled idea that there s something comic about being jewish in america not the philip roth , takenoprisoners funny , in which jewish identity is good , bad , happy , sad , a historical chip on the shoulder , a sign of radical difference rather , the postborscht belt funny of the genial sitcom jew whose difference is amorphous enough to be thoroughly unthreatening the jew as an ethnic accessory that nonjews on both sides of the camera can enjoy without anxiety , like the cute cabala string madonna likes to wear and so , just as bernie loved bridget , and rhoda loved mary , so does greg focker \( mr stiller \) love pam byrnes \( ms polo \) and because greg loves pam , pam s father , jack \( mr de niro \) , does n't love greg not because no man could ever be good enough for his daughter , but because greg does n't look like pam s old squeeze , the fairhaired kevin \( mr wilson \) dargis 'the merchant of venice' starring al pacino , jeremy irons , joseph fiennes and lynn collins directed by michael radford \( r , 127 minutes \) shakespeare s most problematic play at least with respect to modern sensitivities receives an intelligent intepretation from mr radford and from a superb cast mr pacino , showing welcome restraint after a series of overdone stage and screen performances , emphasizes shylock s grief and estrangement , turning him into a fragile monster but his villainy , however much it smacks of blood libel , cannot be discarded without compromising the play s complex ideas about justice and duty , and mr radford does not try to wash away the stain of antisemitism that is woven into the heart of his source he does remind us how much more is going on in the play , and along with his talented production designer and cinematographer , he renders venice as a series of renaissance paintings tableaus that immerse us in the ferment of early modern europe mr irons is quietly mesmerizing in the title role , a creature of mysterious melancholy whose soul seems at once pure and rotted the movie really belongs to ms collins , who gives portia her rightful wit and charisma , and makes her the play s cruel and lovely moral center scott 'million dollar baby' starring clint eastwood , hilary swank and morgan freeman directed by mr eastwood \( pg13 , 135 minutes \) mr eastwood takes what appears to be a conventional boxingmelodrama plot about a crusty old trainer whose heart is melted by a spirited young fighter and turns it into a glowing , somber meditation on friendship , ambition and death the picture s scale is small , and its pacing leisurely , which gives you a chance to savor three lovely performances from ms swank as the young boxer , mr freeman as a worldweary former contender and mr eastwood as the trainer , frankie dunn at 74 , mr eastwood has achieved a level of mastery that leaves him with nothing to prove , and so , unafraid of sentiment and willing to risk clich \? he has made a graceful , lyrical , devastating masterpiece the best film released by a major hollywood studio this year scott 'ocean s twelve' starring george clooney , brad pitt , matt damon , don cheadle and scott caan directed by steven soderbergh \( pg13 , 120 minutes \) at a certain point in the enjoyable , unabashedly trivial caper flick ocean s twelve , crooks played by mr damon , mr cheadle and mr caan start running through the different ways they can get out of their immediate jam things have gone badly for these likable rogues and now most of their crew including the smooth piece of work who gives the film its title , danny ocean played by the equally silky mr clooney has landed in the clink the crooks are looking for a getoutofjailfree card , which , given the film s criminally underdone plot and smog of selfsatisfaction is something that mr soderbergh may have wanted to stash up his own sleeve as anyone within spitting distance of a television set knows , ocean s twelve is the highprofile sequel to mr soderbergh s big box office entertainment ocean s eleven once again mr clooney s danny is the leader of the pack , mr pitt plays his second in command , rusty ryan , and mr damon plays linus , a puppy that desperately wants to be a dog but may not have sprouted the requisite fangs dargis 'the phantom of the opera' starring gerard butler , emmy rossum and minnie driver directed by joel schumacher \( pg13 , 143 minutes \) far too many notes for my taste , a minor character remarks , apropos of the threatening letters being sent by the micromanaging phantom that pretty much sums up the problems with andrew lloyd webber s bombastic score , which is well matched by mr schumacher s production for all the invocations of the angel of music , this film , adapted from the curiously popular stage musical , will most likely leave you with a devilish headache the songs are unlistenable , which also makes them hard to sing , but ms rossum and mr butler show some impressive vocal technique , and ms rossum , in addition to being lovely , has enough movie star luminosity to avoid being buried in the busy sets and elaborate costumes this 2hourand20minute barrage may drive you back to the 1925 version of phantom , which starred lon chaney and which has many virtues for one thing , it is short for another , it s silent scott spanglish' starring adam sandler , t \? leoni and paz vega directed by james l brooks \( pg13 , 110 minutes \) mr brooks , one of the smartest and sunniest men in hollywood , turns his attention to class division , cultural misunderstanding and marital discord in los angeles , all subjects ripe for the kind of warmhearted comedy in which he specializes and all treated with astonishing smugness and dishonesty mr sandler plays john clasky , a successful chef who almost falls for his maid , flor \( ms vega \) , a situation that mr brooks rescues from sleaziness by making jack s wife , deborah \( ms leoni \) , a thoroughgoing monster irredeemably selfish , vain and ridiculous deborah , a bad mother and a useless wife , serves as the film s scapegoat , and her demonization contrasts with the idealization of flor in a way that manages to be both overtly misogynist and implicitly racist mr sandler smiles through it all , playing a nice guy who unwittingly personifies the film s selfadoring liberal bad faith scott 'a very long engagement' starring audrey tautou directed by jeanpierre jeunet \( r , 133 minutes in french , with english subtitles \) if you like battleground carnage delivered with aesthetic brio , the kind that ensures that when a soldier explodes into confetti , his flesh will dapple a trench mate as decoratively as pink rosettes on a cake , this new french film will serve you nicely set during world war i and its immediate aftermath , the film follows the adventures of a young woman , mathilde \( ms tautou \) , who holds fast to the hope that her young soldier fianc \? ill return home from his apparent grave even when death seems to part them , the cord of her love remains unbroken dargis 'white noise' starring michael keaton , chandra west and deborah kara unger directed by geoffrey sax \( pg13 , 101 minutes \) a laughlaced cheap thrill that has nothing to do with the don delillo novel of the same title , white noise was directed by mr sax , whose r \? m \? opefully notes that this wouldbe auteur comes from a long and venerable line of bbctrained directors it is a long and venerable line that on the evidence of his feature filmmaking debut , mr sax may bring to an unintended end it s impossible to say exactly who takes the brunt of the blame here , although the screenwriting credit belongs to niall johnson mr johnson apparently wrote white noise in 2002 , several years after the japanese horror movie ringu helped trigger the recent fad for asian horror and , as in numerous japanese and korean titles , his script hinges on the premise that there are ghosts in the machine anxious to reach out and touch us often , the person on this side of the death divide is a spunky woman or a high school girl in a miniskirt and knee socks , but here the hero reaching across time , space and genre is played by mr keaton dargis 'the woodsman' starring kevin bacon , kyra sedgwick , mos def , benjamin bratt , david alan grier and eve directed by nicole kassell \( r , 87 minutes \) ms kassell directs this story of a paroled child molester struggling to reenter society after 12 years in prison in a lean , unassuming style , which suits the subject matter and gives the fine cast room to explore their complicated , unhappy characters the story is not always plausible , and the atmosphere sometimes feels programmatically grim , but the film is a serious , compassionate attempt at psychological realism , anchored by mr bacon s precise , unsettling performance as a man trying to untangle his decent impulses from his destructive , predatory urges scott pop a selective listing by critics of the times new or noteworthy rock and pop concerts in the new york metropolitan region this weekend denotes a highly

with a contract deadline just after midnight tonight , representatives of the metropolitan transportation authority and the transit workers' union met intermittently yesterday to stave off a strike as the agency s top negotiator warned that we are not in a good place although there was some small movement yesterday on the key issue of wages , the negotiator , gary j dellaverson , said we should be closer now there should be more progress , and i ca n't stand here and say that i'm comfortable with the negotiations where they stand at this instant then he added , i still remain hopeful he spoke just moments after mayor michael r bloomberg announced a comprehensive emergency plan to contend with a walkout the plan would increase ferry service , restrict entry to much of manhattan to highoccupancy vehicles , clear several major thoroughfares including fifth avenue of nearly all traffic but buses and emergency vehicles , and allow groups of riders to haggle with cabbies details , pages b8b9 the union originally called for 8 percent annual raises , but late in the day it indicated that it would accept smaller increases if the authority agreed to decrease disciplinary actions against employees by 25 percent the union did not say how much it was willing to trim its demand the day of stopandstart negotiations was punctuated by the union s sharp criticism of the transportation authority , inconclusive court dealings , and lastminute efforts by suburban railroads to put their own emergency plans in place a strike by local 100 of the transport workers union , which represents 33 , 700 subway and bus workers , would begin at 12 01 am tomorrow walkouts by public employees are illegal under state law besides wages , the two sides disagree over pensions , health insurance and safety mr dellaverson hinted that the authority s chairman , peter s kalikow , might join the talks today he did so at the last minute three years ago to reach a settlement roger toussaint , the president of local 100 , said in an interview last night that the authority was showing little flexibility and was forcing his union s back to the wall he also denounced mr bloomberg s efforts , including a lawsuit seeking huge fines , intended to pressure the union not to strike he said the mayor had so angered union members that he made a strike more likely he s gone way beyond the pale , he said it s giulianilike it has all the earmarks of bullying , something that transit workers do not react well to he said the chances of a walkout were 5050 i have said that a settlement wo n't come from courts , injunctions or intimidation , mr toussaint said while we of course are mindful of the legal penalties our members face , we will not buckle in the face of these threats later , after four and a half hours of offagain , onagain talks , the two sides broke for the night at 11 pm the union officials said the tone had improved slightly , because lawrence g reuter , the president of new york city transit , had joined the talks for the first time mr reuter pressed the union to set individual deadlines today for settling specific issues the city s emergency plan indicated how seriously the mayor is taking the possibility of a strike and how crippling officials believe a subway and bus stoppage would be for riders and the city s economy at the height of the holiday shopping season a strike would be more than just illegal and inconvenient , mr bloomberg said it will threaten public safety and severely disrupt our city and its economy there would be no winners in a strike , the mayor said and i speak for every new yorker when i urge the twu to resolve the contract at the bargaining table gov george e pataki , before leaving for new hampshire , made his most forceful comments yet to discourage a strike , warning of dire consequences and telling the union do n't even threaten a strike arthur z schwartz , a lawyer for the union , said the two sides were supposed to attend a brooklyn court hearing on the city s request for fines the city asked that on the first day , the union be fined 1 million and individual workers 25 , 000 , and that the fines be doubled each successive day mr schwartz said he was told that no hearing was warranted because the city corporation counsel s office , which filed the lawsuit on tuesday , had not supplied the papers the judge needed to decide the matter what happened yesterday in the filing of that lawsuit is simply an effort by the mayor and an effort by the corporation counsel to interfere with negotiations to try to intimidate the members of local 100 , mr schwartz said it is an utterly baseless lawsuit designed only to gather headlines michael a cardozo , the corporation counsel , said the city intended to go ahead with the suit , but was waiting to see the union s next moves our lawsuit is designed to protect the security of the city and to recover damages that the city would suffer in the event there is a strike , he said in a separate lawsuit , the state was granted an injunction on tuesday barring a transit strike or slowdown top negotiators from the two sides have bargained little in recent days three hours on monday and 75 minutes on tuesday mr dellaverson said he was sure the pace would pick up have we been fully engaged \? yes , mr dellaverson said have there been enough meetings to adequately bridge the gap \? no going into yesterday , the authority had offered two raises of 3 percent in a 27month contract on pensions , the authority wants to raise the retirement age for newly hired employees to 62 after 30 years of service , while the union wants to lower it to age 50 after 20 years of service at present , transit workers can retire at age 55 after 25 years of work , with a pension equal to half their annual pay the average is 55 , 000 , including overtime many transit workers have said the authority s offer barely matches inflation in a year that the authority had a 1 billion surplus the authority counters that it will have a 800 million deficit beginning in 2008 the authority s board voted yesterday to spend much of that surplus , angering the union because it allocated none of the surplus to wages mr dellaverson said that the union s proposal , with its lower pension age , 8 percent raises , and improved health coverage , would cost the authority 550 million extra a year the mta proposal is targeted at those longterm challenges that we and other employers are confronting , mr dellaverson said it would be easy but wrong to ignore that criticizing the authority s demand for concessions on pensions , mr toussaint said , the mta is misplaced to believe that the twu will be responsible for a historic decline or reversal for the labor movement with respect to pensions complicating the talks , the union has threatened to strike unless the authority also reaches a contract for 2 , 200 workers at five private bus lines that the authority is taking over those workers have been without a contract for nearly three years with no control over the mta , a state entity , the city can do little more than wait and plan for the worst , mr bloomberg acknowledged the city s plan was largely devised to reduce car traffic as much as possible through extensive car pooling , ride sharing , walking or bicycling mr bloomberg said the city would close several major midtown streets to all but emergency vehicles , private buses , commuter vans and motorcycles during workdays and would shut approaches to manhattan south of 96th street to all cars carrying fewer than four people during the morning rush carpooling sites would be set up to allow drivers to pick up passengers to meet the limit taxicabs will be allowed to carry multiple fares , and will be able to charge based on a zone system cabdrivers will be allowed to charge up to 10 to start and up to 5 for each zone covered during the trip but the mayor said the best bet was to work from home if possible and , if not , to ride a bike or walk all of us should be prepared to deal with significant crowding and delays , and all of us should do our best to be patient and courteous , he said by working together and looking out for each other we 'll be able to weather the storm
traci robinson was a lounge singer , a producer of television commercials , an awardwinning documentary filmmaker and even a movie actress , playing a bit part in the new john travoltasalma hayek crime drama , lonely hearts then she fell in love with a cabinetmaker from long island , sold her house in hollywood and moved east so what does she do now \? what everyone on the east end seems to be doing she sells real estate ms robinson , 43 , joined the growing throng of agents who prowl the hamptons in their leased range rovers , cellphones permanently fused to their ears , street maps close at hand , nibbling cheese and crackers at one open house after another i'm a selfstarter , and i have an entrepreneurial spirit , said ms robinson , who has been working out of the corcoran group s office in sag harbor for a year now in my other professions , i had to get along with so many people the crews , the investors so i find this similar , although not as glamorous and the food is n't as good even so , the attraction is obvious house prices keep leaping upward , especially on the south fork , where the median price in the first quarter of 2005 surpassed 700 , 000 , according to long island profiles , a bay shore company that tracks the real estate market the supply of properties for sale for 1 million or more seems to be expanding exponentially and so is the number of people on a quest for the holy grail the sales commission on a multimilliondollar house the math is seductive the ordinary commission , 6 percent of the sale price , amounts to 60 , 000 on a 1 million house sell just five of those a year as exclusive listings , and you are talking 300 , 000 in gross income close a deal on a single 12 million estate there are several on the market at the moment and the potential payoff is a dizzying 720 , 000 that s why the south fork one of the country s hottest real estate markets , with prices rising at doubledigit rates every year now has more agents and brokers than ever before large companies like the corcoran group , prudential douglas elliman and sotheby s have added scores of sales people in the hamptons over the last five years , and locally owned offices are merging and expanding to compete with the big names and as the industry leaps forward , it is increasingly populated by people like ms robinson , people who had been doing well in some other field before switching to real estate there was a time when we took in anyone who could breathe , said paul brennan , who runs prudential s offices in the hamptons now we 're seeing a maturation people from wall street , the fashion world , attorneys , a tennis professional , a guy who sold a major company he said prudential now had 250 brokers in its eight east end offices , twice as many as five years ago but mr brennan , a 27year veteran in the industry , said that newcomers who think a real estate agent s license is a ticket to an easy sixfigure income for parttime work are in for a rude awakening most of the deals , he said , still go to those who have spent years patiently building reputations it s the old story of 20 percent of the people doing 80 percent of the business , he said the flood of green new agents is taking a toll , though , even on seasoned veterans there are too many brokers now , mr brennan said people get in my way they do n't know what they 're doing it s becoming cumbersome and less professional , so the rest of us have to work smarter and harder some local boutique brokerages have been hard put to keep their feet in the stampede , even when they are led by a local legend like tina s fredericks , who built an enviable reputation for handling big deals over 45 years in the business i'm outnumbered by these big corporations with enormous amounts of money to advertise , while i can barely afford a page a month , ms fredericks said so it s hard to keep my name out there her office now employs just four agents , down from a peak of eight a decade ago all kinds of life paths now lead to real estate in the hamptons thomas scott was a member of the east hampton town police department for 39 years , the last 21 of them as its chief he is now with hamptons realty group jane gill was an eileen ford fashion model with a lucrative ralph lauren contract , and eve jordan combermale was an art director and stylist for j crew , before spending 11 years raising her children they 're with prudential deirdre oren byrne and david stoll were both bigcity lawyers now she is at sotheby s and he is with prudential gary spencer was the head of jp morgan s global commodity derivatives business he is with corcoran now so is claire primrose , a soprano who performed with the vancouver opera all went into real estate within the last few years mr stoll , 37 , was first in his class at brooklyn law school , a law clerk for a united states court of appeals judge and then a litigator at a top manhattan firm , cravath , swaine moore but in 2003 he grew weary of the long hours and moved full time to his summer house in southampton , toying at first with the idea of a solo law practice before deciding to sell houses instead we 're all obsessed with real estate out here anyway , wondering how much our houses are worth , he said selling real estate can be creative and dynamic and interpersonal i used to work 80 or 90 hours a week , but i'm down to half that and of course , the hours are flexible he landed his first exclusive listing in may nowhere is the stampede more evident than in real estate licensing classes at southampton college , 42 students signed up in 1999 for the 45hour introductory course , a requirement for a sales license last spring , enrollment was 131 and there s no sign that demand is going to drop off anytime soon , said laura lyons , the director of the college s continuing education program , which remains in operation even though most of the rest of the campus has closed people have been pouring into the industry nationwide , judging by membership in the national association of realtors stephen cook , the association s vice president for public affairs , said the rolls had grown by 53 percent in the last five years the hamptons , he said , was one of the markets where growth was fastest , along with boston and parts of california although the rest of long island has also seen doubledigit growth , the firstquarter median house price for nassau and suffolk was 447 , 700 , much less than the 700 , 000plus on the south fork to some extent , the agents and the market are chasing each other up a spiral more brokers means prices are being bid up , which would n't happen if buyers were n't willing to pay , said peter elkowitz , the chief financial officer of the long island housing partnership , an association of lenders , developers and community groups that promote lowercost housing but i question why people want to get into a business that has become so competitive one reason is that the south fork is mainly a resort economy , with not many other choices for whitecollar jobs more and more people have few opportunities to maintain a certain life style , so real estate has become one of the attractive options , said john viteritti , a broker who teaches real estate courses at southampton college and new york university and since the market is so hot , it s also an opportunity to be an entrepreneur at nyu , his students tend to be recent college graduates who are unable to find jobs in their chosen fields , mr viteritti said , but at southampton , they tend to be successful people who want a second career that lets them live on the south fork full time jane gill , 51 , was a successful model for 30 years before deciding the island was a better place than the city to raise her daughter she earned her license two years ago her contacts in the fashion world helped her get going , she said so did a longtime interest in architecture and design i was actually able to be myself for the first time , she said i have a voice and an opinion as a model , no one cared what i thought , only whether i looked good now people respect me for what i can do , and i do n't have to worry about that extra 20 pounds typically , a rookie agent will start by selling a few properties that are either listed exclusively with a more established colleague or with multiple brokers either way , that means sharing the commission everyone told me the first year would be difficult , and they did n't underestimate that , ms robinson said when i hit six months , someone said the first two years would be hard she got her first exclusive listing unusually early , just three months after she joined corcoran the house had an indoor pool flanked by fireenginered spiral staircases , and she knew it would take a particular kind of buyer someone older , successful , who entertained often so she hired a professional to stage the house , to arrange the furnishings to make it as appealing as possible that s exactly what i did in commercials , ms robinson said there had to be props , and someone who knew how to position the basket just right or to cover the couch it s just like dressing a set one rainy saturday , she tied some balloons at the end of the driveway and held an open house for other agents none came but at 5 30 pm , a buyer walked in the deal closed for 880 , 000 after the referring broker and the corcoran office received their cut , her share of the commission came to 13 , 000 , 14 percent of the purchase price not bad for a few days' work , until you consider that she had been in real estate for about eight months before she made her first sale i have to say the income has turned out to be a little anticlimactic , but everything grows exponentially , she said since then , she has landed another exclusive , a house priced at just under 27 million not a bad jump , she said like ms robinson , nearly all brokers and agents work as independent contractors , not employees of their brokerage offices it is up to them to find sellers willing to list with them and to bear the costs of the cellphone , range rover and other accouterments of a business the brokerage office provides support staff , desk space , computers , phone service and advertising in exchange for a cut of commissions competition for the commissions has become increasingly cutthroat in exchange for an exclusive listing , more sellers are demanding and more agents are willing to accept commissions smaller than the standard 6 percent so a significant number of the people who are jumping into real estate are finding that they ca n't make a go of it that s evident in the 22 1 2hour refresher courses that agents take every two years to renew their licenses at southampton college , enrollment last spring was exactly the same as five years earlier , ms lyons said the dropout rate for the industry nationally is 80 percent in the first year , mr viteritti said , and the rate in the hamptons is only slightly lower he cited the 4 percent effect agents typically have to work with 100 buyers and sellers to find 4 who will put money in their pocket , he said , and many new agents lack the capital , and thus the staying power , to make it against those odds ms robinson had the profits from selling her house in hollywood to fall back on mr scott had his pension from the police department ms byrne sold a house she owned in wainscott to give herself a cushion , which she has n't yet had to tap not everyone starts out with the contacts i had in the city and out here , she said i came with a blackberry full of names and numbers , and i immediately got business but there s always the chance i could be a top producer one year and do nothing the next year it s the fear that makes me jump out of bed every morning and attack the world

, an editor at american songwriter , for fulfilling the dream first and confirming what you 've suspected all along that petty is an undeniably fascinating guy to talk to sure , there is some dead air in these interviews , but it s abundantly offset by petty s indelible stories of his florida upbringing by a father who liked to poke alligators in the eye for fun , and the time the supposedly laidback petty became so frustrated with a recording session that he punched a wall , shattered his fist and spent eight months retraining himself to use his left hand and the chapter devoted to petty

two retired new york city police detectives , onetime partners who had long been suspected of ties to organized crime , were charged by federal prosecutors yesterday with taking part in eight murders on behalf of the mafia most while one or both were still active members of the police force the charges , detailed in an indictment unsealed in federal district court in brooklyn , were among the most startling allegations of police corruption in memory in one case , in 1990 , prosecutors said the detectives , driving an unmarked police car , pulled over a mafia captain on the belt parkway in brooklyn and shot him to death for a rival mob figure in another , in 1986 , they flashed their badges and kidnapped a mobster , threw him in the trunk of their car and delivered him to a rival , who tortured and killed him in a stunning betrayal of their shields , their colleagues and the citizens they were sworn to protect , louis eppolito and stephen caracappa secretly worked on the payroll of the mob while they were members of the nypd , the united states attorney in brooklyn , roslynn r mauskopf , said at a news conference to announce the indictment for years , ms mauskopf charged , the men had been paid handsomely for their role in the killings and for routinely funneling secret information about criminal investigations to other members of organized crime in most of the killings , she said , they did not pull the trigger but helped other hit men track down the victims , at one point becoming so instrumental that they were put on the mob s payroll at 4 , 000 a month mr eppolito , 56 , who once cowrote a book about his life as a police officer whose relatives were in the mob , and mr caracappa , 63 , who worked in a police unit that was responsible for investigating mob killings , were arrested on wednesday night at an italian restaurant in las vegas , ms mauskopf said mr eppolito retired in 1990 , mr caracappa two years later for more than a decade , the men , while collecting their police pensions , have lived across the street from one another in an affluent gated community in las vegas , mr caracappa working as a private investigator and mr eppolito playing bit parts in nearly a dozen popular movies , including goodfellas portraying mobsters , hoodlums and drug dealers they appeared in federal district court in las vegas last night , where an acting united states magistrate judge , jennifer togliatti , postponed an extradition hearing until today the charges , dramatic as they are , were not entirely surprising the pair were investigated by the fbi and the new york police department in 1994 after a mafia informant provided officials with many details of the killings but the informant , who prosecutors said had commissioned many of the crimes , was later discredited , and federal authorities at the time were unable to build a prosecutable case , officials said yesterday but now , with a new informant , whose name was not disclosed , and a team of what ms mauskopf called tenacious investigators , several of them also retired city police detectives , the authorities were able to collect enough evidence over several years to persuade a grand jury to indict the men the former detectives were charged with a racketeering conspiracy , which includes their roles in the killings , two attempted murders , obstruction of justice , money laundering and other crimes the indictment accuses them of working as secret associates of the luchese crime family they are charged with disclosing the identity of six cooperating witnesses three of whom were killed and compromising several federal and state investigations none of the eight murders charged in the case all but one involving victims who were organized crime figures occurred after the first , failed attempt to make a case against the men mr eppolito s lawyer , richard a schonfeld , said his client absolutely denies the charges and cited what he called an exemplary 21year police career , with 107 medals , including several for valor , in arguing that he should be released edward hayes , a lawyer in new york who represented mr caracappa when he was under investigation more than a decade ago , said he was shocked at the charges he said the mob figure who made the accusations at that time , anthony casso , was a homicidal maniac and a raving lunatic he said his client , a vietnam combat veteran who retired as a firstgrade detective , had denied the allegations before the charges against the two men , who face up to life in prison if convicted , will be resolved over the coming months , or perhaps years , in federal district court in brooklyn but the accusations themselves are a bizarre and breathtaking chapter in the history of corrupt police officers , mobsters and murder both men joined the force in 1969 , a year in which the city , with abbreviated background checks , hired an unusual number of officers who were later arrested or fired mr eppolito had relatives in organized crime his father , ralph , was called fat the gangster and his uncle , james , was known as jimmy the clam but mr eppolito did not disclose any of that on his police application he went on to serve as a patrol officer and detective , working in the brooklyn robbery squad and in south brooklyn and after he retired , he wrote , with bob drury , mafia cop the story of an honest cop whose family was the mob , in which he chronicled what he said were wrongful accusations brought by the police department that he sold information to the mob mr eppolito was cleared of charges brought against him by the department in that case in 1985 mr caracappa , who was mr eppolito s partner in the robbery unit , went on to join the department s prestigious major case squad , where he helped form the organized crime homicide unit there , he specialized in the luchese family and served as a clearinghouse on police and fbi investigations into all mob killings , collecting information it was information , prosecutors now allege , that he sold to members of the mafia revealing the identities of confidential informants , wiretaps and pending cases in one instance , the information allowed mr casso and the luchese family boss to flee before they were indicted one of the killings involved a case of mistaken identity mr casso , eager to avenge an attempt on his own life in 1986 , asked the two detectives to track down a gambino family soldier named nicholas guido , according to prosecutors but when mr caracappa used a police department computer database to find an address for the man , he retrieved the address for the wrong nicholas guido , according to prosecutors , and instead turned over the address of an innocent man who officials said was mildly retarded mob killers found the wrong mr guido outside his home on christmas day 1986 they shot and killed him

partly , it s a welltodo district with lots of parents who are doctors and other scientists they 've made research a top priority , naming a former university professor , dr george baldo , to run the program in 1999 , the school doubled the program s size to 130 students and budgeted for a second fulltime teaching slot the school subscribes to an online service giving students unlimited access to the latest research papers dr baldo s program has its own 4 , 000 printer that can produce an entire science fair poster board in a single 42inchwide sheet , and a 30 , 000 budget to pay travel expenses to nine science fairs a year we do n't worry about raffling off a case of soda to buy materials , says dr baldo he has a large enough staff to make sure all 38 pages of the intel international science and engineering fair application get filled out correctly by the 25 students going i finally found the two forms you kept asking me for , tony li , a student , told dr baldo the other day they were under a couch but none of these are the main reason ward melville excels high school students cannot do research at this level without adult mentors often a university professor plus a team of grad students to pick a topic that will break new ground , yet be manageable , and to supervise them at every step the biggest advantage lauren miller , a ward melville intel semifinalist , had during her research on feeding worms \? ward melville is so close to the state university at stony brook , lauren could bike to the lab daily to work with prof bruce brownawell and his doctoral students aditi ramakrishnan , a semifinalist who researched toxicity of nanoparticles in cosmetics , says she would have no project if it were not for the daily help she received from a team of nearby stony brook professors i'm only 17 , she said i did n't have the background to create the experiment i did n't know how to use the equipment i could n't create the hypothesis martin rocek , a stony brook physics professor , picked a math project for neal wadhwa of ward melville it happened there was a new development in the field that was not exceedingly technical , says professor rocek , who gave neal private geometry tutorials and suggested several calculations to work out those calculations broke new ground in the supermanifold field , but neal says that at first , he did n't grasp what his answers meant professor rocek told me the significance of what i 'd found , he said i did n't know why is ward melville so dominant \? said miriam rafailovich , a stony brook professor who supervised six ward melville students this year proximity with a capital p getting kids to a lab is the big issue for bigtime science fairs , the single most important research students do is finding a willing mentor the october sky projects four boys standing in a field shooting off rockets are all but gone even classroom science teachers racing to finish prepackaged state and advanced placement curriculums rarely can oversee serious research dr baldo agrees that ward melville would not be so dominant if it were an hour drive from the university instead of five minutes until 1998 , melanie krieger ran the ward melville program , then left to start a similar program at kennedy high in plainview , another upscale long island suburb in 12 years at ward melville she averaged 7 semifinalists a year the last seven years at plainview , she has averaged 2 she s every bit as good as she was at ward melville , said professor rafailovich but her plainview kids have trouble getting to a lab for help it s over an hour drive to stony brook that s a big problem this is n't the kind of research kids do in their garage aditi spent last summer at a stony brook lab , sometimes pulling allnighters professor rafailovich gave her the topic to examine whether tiny particles in cosmetics , nanoparticles , could damage skin cells aditi walked into a project where a million dollars had been spent to get to that point , said professor rafailovich yuan sun , a doctoral candidate , made the nanoparticles that aditi studied dr nadine pernodet was in charge of cell cultures and the stateoftheart sanitizing air hood that grew skin cells for aditi i saw nadine every single day for many hours , said aditi i could not have done it without nadine for aditi to see the damage the nanoparticles did in a cell she had to be trained on a halfmilliondollar confocal microscope that sees three dimensions to determine whether nanoparticles did similar damage in human fagocyte cells required aditi to work with bacteria , something she could not legally do because of her age so dr celine pujol did it aditi decided how many nanoparticles to add , what concentrations and the protocol , said dr rafailovich but dr pujol did the handson work the nice thing about working with high school students , says dr rafailovich , is they 're so anxious to find a project , they 're willing to try out theories that are a little crazy but need to be tested grad students are often too worried about getting a degree and making a living to take that chance neal wadhwa was researching his project at stony brook while his mentor , professor rocek , was serving as host to a national math conference neal s research involved yau s theorem and he actually got to meet st yau of harvard at the conference , professor rocek circulated neal s findings , and those worldclass mathematicians made suggestions to improve his project thursday , neal is to be in washington , one of 40 intel finalists competing for a grand prize scholarship of 100 , 000 he s going by plane , but it took lots of very smart adults to get him there on education email edmike nytimescom
if there were a publicpolicy superhero on the landscape one who could stem illegal immigration , create affordable housing in the suburbs , raise the minimum wage , end global economic displacements , guarantee liberty and justice for all and assure that lawns were mowed and beans were picked at reasonable rates there would be no trouble in farmingville today but farmingville exists in the real world , where problems of all kinds tend to collide , overlap and linger unaddressed , until someone comes along and attacks one of them , forgetting it is connected to the others often thereby creating a whole new problem by some accounts , that is what happened a week ago when the suffolk county executive , steve levy , ordered his police department to join forces with the town of brookhaven building inspectors in shutting down an illegal rooming house the raid resulted in the arrest of a landlord and the displacement of about 60 men , all or most of them illegal immigrants who work as day laborers advocates for the workers assailed mr levy for what they called an unnecessarily harsh assault that pushed 60 people in precarious circumstances into homelessness but neighbors applauded mr levy s boldness in attacking a problem that they had been asking public officials to do something anything about for a long time migrants from mexico and central america who mass at street corners each morning seeking a day s work , living in overcrowded and unsightly homes next door to them they bought a house with a white picket fence , so their kids could have good schools and enjoy the american dream , mr levy said of those neighbors , many of whom he first met when he served as the state assemblyman from the farmingville area having 30 people in a flophouse next door was not part of the arrangement they did n't sign up for this according to this view , the problem in such cases is not one of migrants per se , but of property rights and building codes if the flophouse was inhabited by 60 caucasians , or college kids , we would have done the same thing , mr levy said , referring to the raid on june 20 but as other officials from new york to california know well , a decadeslong influx of latino immigrants , many of them in the country illegally , and a national immigration policy that varies between neglectful accommodation and harsh enforcement have left local officials like mr levy holding a rubik s cube of public policy problems at every turn , these officials find themselves out of alignment with one or another mission of government for example , police officers who try to forge relationships with people in immigrant communities find that those sources dry up when there is any whiff of federal immigration surveillance building and health inspectors face similar suspicions when they try to gain access to rooming houses shutting down a rooming house may put a large number of people on the street , as happened in farmingville but federal laws forbid the use of socialservices money to aid illegal immigrants , so local officials who want to help relocate the displaced must do so at arm s length , usually by enlisting charities and nonprofit groups citizens tend to see what results as stasis people stand up at meetings and say , 'the town is not doing anything ! ' said jon kaiman , the north hempstead supervisor , who frequently receives complaints about overcrowded rooming houses in new cassel or port washington or carle place the truth is , we are doing a lot , but it s a slow process pressure from homeowners' groups may be speeding it up town and county officials said the farmingville raid was the first of as many as 117 planned closures in suffolk north hempstead is seeking injunctions against several operators of flophouses , too people are angrier and angrier , mr kaiman said we have to show that we are doing something that something may prove to be a bit gentler , at least initially , than it was in farmingville mr kaiman says he has already lined up charitable groups to help in the event of any future raids and closures in north hempstead and after taking a public drubbing over his county s tactics , mr levy said tuesday that future raids in suffolk would probably also be accompanied by similar socialservice efforts but these are matters of style rather than substance the options are pretty much the same for officials here and across the country , and those options are few we have many of the same problems that you see on long island , and new jersey and atlanta and kansas city , said maria giuriato , a city councilwoman in salinas , calif , where farms attract large numbers of migrant workers mexicans are fleeing by the thousands and thousands in oaxaca , for instance , the coffee growers are suffering from competition from nafta , ms giuriato said , referring to the north american free trade agreement there are whole towns without men in them they all come here , and there is not enough affordable housing wages are too low workers are forced to live in very bad conditions besides sitting on the salinas city council , ms giuriato also serves as the community relations director for the department of social and employment services in monterey county when flophouses are closed in salinas , inspectors and police officers hand out calling cards for agencies like the monterey county housing advocacy council , a private group that helps relocate anyone , no questions asked they recently shut down a storefront where 30 men were stacked like cordwood , said marilyn dorman , the council s executive director some of them trickled in here looking for help most of them did n't there is a wariness of anything that looks official advocates on long island were incensed when even such token aid was not forthcoming in farmingville so now where do these people go \? that is the question , said the rev allan ramirez , pastor of the brookville reformed church and an advocate for latino workers on long island what is the benefit to the community of putting people out on the street \? there is none advocates like mr ramirez and x chitl casta eda , the coordinator of the institute of mexicans abroad at the university of california , in berkeley , argue that immigrants , legal or illegal , contribute in a major way to the local and national economy and do not deserve to be treated as quasicriminals undocumented workers add 120 billion a year to the national economy and pay between 25 billion and 30 billion in taxes , said ms casta eda they receive no benefit from those taxes they are denied access to health care , government assistance or the civil protections of the law the anonymity of the immigrants' lives , in most cases a purposeful blendingin , makes their occasional surfacing on the front pages all the more startling whether as victims of a 2000 attack in farmingville by white supremacists , or under the glare of television cameras trained on the dilapidated house where 64 men are said to have lived in 900 square feet of space but beneath the surface of that virtual invisibility an invisibility that enshrouds them even as they cut grass and blow leaves , bus tables , paint houses , lay bricks , dig ditches , haul asbestos , strip roofs , pour blacktop the emotions evoked by the day laborers are strong one neighborhood advocate in farmingville calls them terrorists murky patriot groups from the far west have organized marches to denounce them mr ramirez , the advocate , said that mr levy s raid amounted to ethnic cleansing , a remark that prompted mr levy to fire the phrase lunatic fringe at mr ramirez , who responded in an interview by calling mr levy evil we have helped to close down a place where men were living in concentrationcamplike conditions , mr levy said tuesday if there were a fire in that house , and people died , the same people who attack me for closing it would be attacking me for not having closed it , he said as for the emotions of the immigrants themselves , leery as they are of newspaper reporters as well as building inspectors , the record is incomplete but emerging piecemeal the binational health task force , a joint group of researchers from mexico and the united states , found in one recent study that after diabetes and hypertension , the most common health problem among latino immigrant workers was depression they are away from their families for long periods , and they are living in crowded conditions with no access to health care , said ms giuriato of salinas , a member of the 30member task force after 10 years of this , the predominant experience is depression
in the wake of another deflating game , someone suggested that the knicks had simply been outhustled , and coach herb williams agreed , adding , you said it after a 117107 loss to the los angeles lakers on tuesday night left the knicks with an 04 road trip , someone wondered if stephon marbury was angry i have no comment to that , he said there is a lot the knicks \( 2941 \) will not say or elaborate upon these days , including anything resembling a concession speech , although it will not be long before they need one the disastrous trip left them six games out of the playoff field with 12 games left to play barring a minor miracle say , a defection by shaquille o'neal to manhattan the knicks will endure their fourth straight losing season as the season draws to a close , the knicks appear to be surrendering to their own downward momentum they allowed 100 points in each of the four road losses , exhibiting no trace of the defensive grit they showed in the previous weeks listen , the season is not over until you play 82 games , said williams , whose tenure as the coach could end when the season does we all get paid to do a job for 82 games so you ca n't make excuses the one thing i hate is making excuses sometimes you can say , 'this did n't work , that did n't work , ' but you come to work , you do what you 're supposed to do period if it do n't work that night , it does n't work that night but at least you come out and you give an effort the knicks returned home yesterday with none of the optimism or the fire that accompanied them a week ago after victories over san antonio and boston they stumbled in overtime at seattle last friday , starting a chain reaction that led to successively lessinspired efforts against portland , golden state and the lakers in some games , they were beaten by offensive rebounding \( portland , golden state \) , and in others by poor transition defense \( 43 fastbreak points by the lakers \) despite an impressive rally from late february through midmarch , the knicks are no better than they were before the allstar game break they are 12 games under 500 , matching the season low they first hit on feb 11 it s just disappointing at how quickly it flipped , malik rose said we had something going at the beginning of the trip , and it does n't look that way right now we just have to keep pushing
the endless pieces of advice came from his parents and his siblings , from teammates and opposing players , from the coaches in the clubhouse and the selfstyled coaches in the stands it seemed everyone except tom glavine had a theory on what was wrong with him and how to fix it the problem , according to those in his ear , was his delivery , his demeanor , his mechanics , his arm angle and his age only his haircut appeared to be ok none of the tips were solicited and yet all of them were applied last night in a 20 victory over the st louis cardinals after glavine delivered his finest performance of the season , giving up four hits over seven innings against the national league s highestscoring team , he received a grudging ovation from 43 , 495 at shea stadium , many of whom had questioned if he was still capable of such a performance i do n't think many people came to the park tonight thinking i 'd throw a shutout , glavine said that s what makes it fun the mets will send pedro mart nez to the mound saturday for the kind of onetwo punch they had envisioned at the start of the season all those who begged the 39yearold glavine to change got exactly what they wanted because he took a few miles an hour off his pitches , sacrificing velocity for control , he did not walk a batter because he threw more fastballs on the inside part of the plate , the outside corner was open for his signature sinker and because he sped up his entire approach , the cardinals were offbalance and the game was over in 2 hours 10 minutes glavine altered his delivery , and cliff floyd did the same to his stance after watching videotape yesterday of his miserable 2for22 trip , floyd went to the batting cage and practiced crouching a few inches lower than normal a minor adjustment translated to 840 feet worth of home runs the mets managed only three hits off st louis starting pitcher jason marquis , a staten island native , but one was floyd s 425foot home run and another was his 415foot home run floyd was rewarded with the first curtain call of his 10year major league career i played a long time in florida , said floyd , who already has 10 home runs this season they did n't have enough people in the stands for one of those if floyd has become a fan favorite , second baseman kazuo matsui remains the resident punching bag he made a throwing error in the seventh inning , then rushed a potential doubleplay grounder in the eighth , bobbling it three times and allowing runners on first and second with no outs roberto hernandez , quickly emerging as the most reliable relief pitcher in the mets' bullpen , came in to strike out pinchhitter jim edmonds and induce two weak ground balls i go out there with the mentality of a closer , said hernandez , a twotime allstar closer for the chicago white sox who barely made the mets' roster out of spring training i'm just closing out that inning hernandez knows from experience what it feels like for a pitcher to be told he has lost his stuff in the past few weeks , it seemed glavine was tipping pitches , being squeezed by umpires and being shown the quickest route to an early retirement his record plunged to 14 , his earned run average rocketed to 687 , and he heard his critics whisper that a very likely hall of fame career had entered its final stage believe me , i evaluate myself every time i pitch , glavine said but i did n't think i was that bad i never felt i was in a situation where i 'd lost it i thought it was a shortterm thing the only person who did not try to coach glavine was his manager willie randolph met with glavine on numerous occasions in the past few weeks to voice his support in postgame news conference after postgame news conference , randolph reiterated that no matter how many runs glavine gave up , he was not going to mess with a twotime cy young award winner , and he was certainly not going to demote him you do n't overreact with a guy like this because you know it s just a matter of time , randolph said you know a guy like tommy glavine will get himself in the right direction he deserved an outing like this the mets seemed to sense the game s importance knowing that glavine had allowed 10 firstinning runs this season , setting a dangerous tone for each outing , first baseman doug mientkiewicz started the game by diving into a camera well chasing a foul pop mientkiewicz did not come up with the ball , but glavine retired the side in order , a sign of what was to come so confounded were the cardinals that after larry walker hit a weak fly ball against glavine , he flung his bat toward the visiting dugout and almost hit albert pujols in the ondeck circle for the first time this season , glavine was not the target of the fans' frustrations at shea stadium instead , he was the cause of their delight
books about , inspired by or making reference to bruce springsteen are hardly a new , or especially rare , phenomenon born to run , the first volume of dave marsh s quasiauthorized biography , appeared in 1979 , and is now available along with its sequel , glory days , in a single volume called bruce springsteen two hearts springsteen s lyrics , which frequently , if modestly , display their own literary pedigree , resonate in the prose of writers like bobbie ann mason , richard ford , stephen king \( who prefaced his epic novel the stand with a quotation from springsteen s song jungleland \) and t c boyle , who took the title for his story collection greasy lake from imagery in a cut from springsteen s first album the basic boss studies syllabus includes daniel cavicchi s tramps like us , a sociological study of his fan base rolling stone s omnibus bruce springsteen the rolling stone files and it ai n't no sin to be glad you 're alive , eric alterman s knowledgeable and rousing elaboration of the promise of bruce springsteen in 1999 , when he reunited the e street band for a long , triumphal tour , it seemed springsteen s main enterprise would be the consolidation of his reputation as the greatest and perhaps also the last rocker to emerge from the ferment of the baby boom his recent releases , apart from the ghost of tom joad , had been mainly archival , and the reunion shows were devoted largely to breathing new life into old favorites and to a joyful , generous rock 'n' roll revivalism but then came sept11 , which called forth the rising , his \( and maybe anyone s \) most convincing rock record since the reagan era , and the 2004 election campaign , which occasioned springsteen s first public endorsement \( on the oped page of this newspaper \) of a presidential candidate those events , and the release this spring of devils dust , have sent the bruceologists back to their desks , and the result is a spate of revisitings , reinterpretations , reissues and recyclings , from rock critics , psychiatrists , historians and fiction writers two new story collections tennessee jones s deliver me from nowhere \( soft skull press , paper , 12 \) and meeting across the river stories inspired by the haunting bruce springsteen song \( bloomsbury , paper , 1495 \) , an anthology edited by jessica kaye and richard j brewer serve mainly as reminders of springsteen s own superior skill as a storyteller jones s slim volume contains 10 linked stories suggested by the lean , grim vignettes of springsteen s nebraska album , while meeting across the river comprises 20 variations on a noirish monologue that may be the least memorable cut on born to run it s what s not in the lyric , martin j smith writes in a foreword , rather than what is , that makes the song so intriguing , thus inadvertently establishing the superfluousness of the undertaking what the various contributors , many of them crime novelists , put in amounts mainly to the toughguy clich s that already hang too thickly over the song jones , adding a dimension of sexual anxiety to the tales of hard luck and aimlessness in nebraska , does a bit better his versions of highway patrolman and my father s house , in particular , go farther into the darkness on the edge of town than springsteen himself has ventured but you ca n't help wondering if jones s imagination has been hobbled by the songs he s chosen to lean on since , for instance , he can hardly match the courtroom monologue that concludes johnny 99 \( now judge , judge , i had debts no honest man can pay \) , jones pushes it offstage , into the hearsay testimony of another character i do n't remember exactly what he said , she confesses i wish i had it recorded so i could just play it back for you at that point , you may prefer to cue up the cd which , of course , you are likely to do anyway springsteen s command of his chosen themes , and the power and sophistication he brings to them , makes criticism largely a matter of saying amen books about elvis presley tend to traffic in either rootsy antiquarianism or slick mythologizing bob dylan inspires exegetes and soothsayers springsteen encourages hagiography every fan knows it s hard to be a saint in the city , and every reader of the bible \( one of springsteen s preferred storehouses of phrase and image \) has heard that it s not easy to be a prophet in your own country maybe , in springsteen s case , it only looks easy god or anyone who has been to a springsteen concert knows the man works hard by now , though , 30 years after the release of born to run landed him simultaneously on the covers of newsweek and time , the mantle of prophet and oracle perhaps even of saint seems to rest as naturally on springsteen s muscular shoulders as the strap to his blond fender esquire or clarence clemons s hand virtually all the books under consideration here are documents of faith , written by folks who will always find some reason to believe \( as well as any excuse to quote some lyrics my apologies \) but for this very reason it may be worthwhile to take note of the views of heretics and dissidents , in particular those who do not so much criticize the quality of springsteen s music as question the authenticity of his oracular , populist persona john lennon sang that a workingclass hero was something to be in england , maybe , but in this country , where money and mobility tend to dissolve and to mystify social divisions , a workingclass hero may be a contradiction in terms and so springsteen , the son of a bus driver and a legal secretary , occasionally encounters suspicion when , from his current position as an unimaginably rich and successful rock star , he speaks up for , and in the voices of , the marginal and the downtrodden his preacherly demeanor solicits accusations of bad faith , while his forays into political activism \( including his minitour in support of john kerry near the end of last year s presidential campaign \) can be caricatured as the wellmeaning sentiments of yet another wealthy showbusiness liberal springsteen s sincerity can also rankle those who prefer their pop culture affectless and ironical , or who are more attuned to the clever manipulation of sampled bricabrac than to the struggle for mastery over historical influences in a recent article in slate , stephen metcalf made the provocatively revisionist claim that the real bruce was neither the singer of quiet , guthriesque ballads nor the purveyor of grand , operatic anthems , but rather the scruffy , mischievous new jersey boardwalk habitu a scrawny little dirtbag from the shore who composed the verbose , playful , musically adventuresome shaggydog tales of his first two albums , greetings from asbury park , nj and the wild , the innocent the e street shuffle in metcalf s account , it was the rock critic jon landau , author of the most famous line of rockcritic prophecy \( i saw rock 'n' roll future and its name is bruce springsteen \) and after that springsteen s producer and mentor , who transformed the charming beach bum into a selfconscious man of the people and , consequently , into a darling of the intellectuals for metcalf , at the same time that landau intellectualized bruce , he antiintellectualized him , minting a familiar , durable persona that turns out to be jon landau s middleclass fantasy of white , workingclass authenticity , and the basis of what is in essence , a white minstrel act strong words but authenticity is a peculiar criterion to apply to a rock musician , since american popular music since the 1950 s has provided fertile ground for selfinvention , contradiction and crosspollination the personas of the great popular musicians of the rock era from elvis to prince , from bob dylan to madonna are hardly organic products of native soil there are no pure products of america which is not to endorse metcalf s cynical view of springsteen s imaginative project of the past three decades , but rather to suggest that the idea of authenticity needs to be applied somewhat differently not to springsteen s persona which i would argue even the most passionate and literalminded fan understands to be , to some degree , an artifact , an act but rather to the experience of witnessing and participating in a springsteen performance , and also to the musical , lyrical and conceptual integrity of the songs themselves to my mind , no one has written better about the texture and rhythm of a springsteen show than jimmy guterman his new book , runaway american dream listening to bruce springsteen \( da capo , paper , 1595 \) , is a collection of loose , energetic essays that , as they meander and overlap , add up to a passionate , highly subjective portrait of the artist in relation to his public guterman , whose other books include the worst rock 'n' roll records of all time , makes some interesting and occasionally counterintuitive judgments about springsteen s records , but his greatest knack is for using particular shows and tours to set up wideranging excursions into musical history his perspective the one on which rock criticism was founded in the late 1960 s is that of the smart guy in the audience , plucking ideas and emotions out of the stream of familiar songs and wondering what , beyond the price of the ticket , it all amounts to guterman s understanding of the bond between springsteen and his audience , a phenomenon empirically observed at who knows how many stadium , arena and club shows a comprehensive list of such events appears in the back of the ties that bind bruce springsteen a to e to z \( visible ink , paper , 2495 \) , gary graff s spirited and comprehensive encyclopedia of bossiana is both nuanced and incisive , as is his description of the songwriting ethic that guarantees that bond since darkness on the edge of town , springsteen , according to guterman , has told accurate , unflinching stories of the people who were n't as lucky as he was as he looked out at the vast stadium crowds , he must have known those were the people filling the stadiums they still needed to see a reflection of themselves onstage springsteen still needed to deliver that of course , this has proven to be a complicated undertaking for one thing , the scope of springsteen s reference the kind of characters who show up in many of the songs on the ghost of tom joad and his new album , devils dust has broadened far beyond his core audience and that audience itself may have narrowed as rock has left behind the last traces of youthful rebellion to become the soundtrack of wistful middle age still , no one who has stood in a stadium during the second verse of promised land or the opening of hungry heart can deny that the sense of identification between the singer , his subjects and his fans is powerful and deep at those moments , springsteen stops singing and listens as a hundred thousand people sing back his firstperson lyrics this ritual transaction underlies robert coles s bruce springsteen s america the people listening , a poet singing \( random house , paper , 1395 \) \( it s one of the only entries in the boss bibliography , by the way , that does not take its title from a springsteen lyric \) the subtitle may overreach this people is as likely to be listening to toby keith or 50 cent as to the bard coles places in the line of walt whitman and william carlos williams even so , coles s book , in spite of a certain wishfulfilling , populist sentimentality , turns listening into an ingeniously literalminded exercise in anecdotal sociology using the documentary method he has been refining since the early 1960 s , coles sits down with a cross section of americans , not all of them especially interested in bruce springsteen , and listens to them talking about what they hear in particular songs his style of transcription can be grating it is sometimes hard to believe that ordinary americans talk in the ostentatiously folksy vernacular coles puts between quotation marks but bruce springsteen s america nonetheless attempts something rare and valuable in the study of popular culture it tries to record the complicated reactions people have to the music they hear , and the contradictory , freeassociative ways we connect that music to our own lives the book s best section presents a law enforcement officer contending with tracks like johnny 99 and highway patrolman that cut against his ideas about work , morality and crime his response to american skin \( 41 shots \) , springsteen s song about the shooting of amadou diallo by new york city police officers in 1999 , is a pr cis of the contradictions that the song tries to explore , but that even springsteen s generous , capacious personality has had a hard time containing he does , nonetheless , contain multitudes , and at this stage in his career there is no shortage of writers eager to place him in the broadest context of american cultural history born in the usa bruce springsteen and the american tradition \( wesleyan university , paper , 2295 \) , jim cullen s 1997 study , newly updated to include springsteen s response to 9 11 , marshals impressive scholarship to assimilate the boss into the main currents of american thought or at least into the canon of the american studies curriculum \( cullen , currently on the faculty of the ethical culture fieldston school in new york , has a phd in american studies from brown \) some of his readings are more persuasive than others much as i love the idea of springsteen as torchbearer of a smallr republican tradition stretching back through roosevelt and lincoln into the enlightenment , cullen s argument has the effect of installing him in a stable full of academic hobbyhorses rather than in a vital constellation of ideas the chapter on springsteen s place within a tradition of american roman catholic writers and artists is more interesting , since it provides a cultural context for the dialectic of sin and grace , alienation and despair that has given structure to springsteen s music since born to run a more unusual kind of contextualization informs 4th of july , asbury park a history of the promised land \( bloomsbury , 2495 \) , daniel wolff s wonderfully evocative history of the new jersey resort town where springsteen , after graduating from freehold high school and briefly attending ocean county community college , served his rock 'n' roll apprenticeship among other things , wolff s book footnotes some of the place names and geographical features in springsteen s lyrics \( the narrator of something in the night , who s riding down kingsley , figuring i 'll get a drink is cruising one of the city s main thoroughfares , a block inland from the water , named for a 19thcentury methodist minister \) the chapters dealing with springsteen himself also show how asbury park s music scene divided by race , class and taste influenced the intricate sound of his early records but really , springsteen is less the subject of 4th of july , asbury park than a kind of hovering spirit in the night , and perhaps also a marketing conceit wolff characterizes the book , which stretches back to the town s founding after the civil war by an enterprising methodist named james bradley , as a rock 'n' roll history , a grand , sad story of racism and real estate , political hardball and seaside pleasureseeking it hardly explains springsteen none of these books really do but it does remind us , in fascinating detail , where he comes from a o scott is a film critic at the times
it is not every day that shareholders get a peek inside the corporate boardroom to see how effectively or not their representatives , the directors , are overseeing management that s why the fourpage resignation letter from michael p berry , an independent director at corinthian colleges , is so riveting it describes a compliant board that sits comfortably in the pocket of corinthian s management corinthian colleges is a forprofit secondary education company operating 94 colleges in the united states and 34 in canada based in santa ana , calif , the company offers diploma programs in health care , business , criminal justice , trades and technology it was formed in 1995 and has been a public company for six years almost 80 percent of its revenue in fiscal 2005 came from federal financial aid , aka the taxpayers late last thursday , corinthian released the full text of mr berry s letter , which was dated sept 13 securities and exchange commission rules require that such a letter be made public mr berry was on corinthian s board for three years during that time he served on the company s compensation , audit , and nominating and corporate governance committees he has held senior positions at harvard and done executive stints at barnes noble , disney and the cheesecake factory he is president of michael p berry consulting and investments in boston mr berry s term on the corinthian board was set to expire in november he could not be reached for comment shareholders of corinthian have surely had their ups and downs in recent years the company s growth has come largely through acquisitions of the 128 campuses , 95 were acquired in 2004 , the company doubled its number of campuses but recent financial results have disappointed while corinthian s net revenue in the year that ended june 30 was 964 million , almost double what the company generated in 2003 , its net income has fallen over the last two years , to 584 million from 624 million in 2003 corinthian recently restated its financial results for 2000 through 2004 and for the first three quarters of 2005 to reflect a problem in its recognition of tuition revenue the company s stock has also declined it has lost 31 percent of its value since january mr berry addressed his letter to david moore , chairman of corinthian s board and a founder of the company it focuses only on mr berry s experiences as a director at corinthian , of course but because it decries excessive executive pay , doormat directors and misleading corporate spin , it could double as a shareholder manifesto he begins with the company s dismal results for the year that ended in june not only were the results disappointing , he wrote , but for me the explanations were equally if not more unacceptable as they regurgitated the rationales offered so many times before to the board and the public through our quarterly filings , and therefore were not reassuring that management fully understands the many systemic shortcomings occurring around them mr berry obviously prefers the nospin zone i am further bothered by the fact that despite poor operating results , our compensation policy is approaching a level where total compensation is not consistent with performance , mr berry continued specifically the annual stock grants given out over the years to management at all levels as a percentage of outstanding shares are unacceptably high however , to vote against these grants is not possible , as the internal pressure is immense to continue with these grants , as well as with the total compensation proposed by management according to mr berry , directors of corinthian do not see meeting materials until the very last minute and are not encouraged to add items to the meeting agenda you know for three years i have been very troubled that the board has permitted there to be meetings before , during and after the board meeting , he wrote , where individual board members are privy to information not available to the entire board mr berry went on i emphatically do not agree with your statement to me and to the board during our last meeting that your philosophy of the board s role was 'that it is for management to propose and the board to dispose ' in conclusion , mr berry wrote i am certain your management team will welcome my departure the best thing is to get rid of the nuisance who is asking the questions that do require the hard answers asked not solely for me but for your shareholders mr berry leaves behind on corinthian s board hank adler , a former partner at deloitte touche loyal wilson , a managing director at primus venture partners paul r st pierre , a corinthian founder linda arey skladany , a former senior associate commissioner at the food and drug administration alice t kane , an insurance and mutual fund executive who had been at the american general financial group and terry o hartshorn , a founder and chief executive of pacificare health systems anna marie dunlap , corinthian s spokeswoman , said that none of the directors would discuss mr berry s letter but , she said , the company is confident that its board is strong and independent and that corinthian s directors reject mr berry s characterization of them as lapdogs jack massimino served on corinthian s board for six years prior to becoming ceo , she said he would tell you that the board many times turned down proposals related to acquisitions or compensation she added that mr berry s letter came after he was advised that the board had voted unanimously not to invite him to stand for reelection in november gregory p taxin , chief executive of glass lewis company , an institutional investor advisory service in san francisco , applauded mr berry s noisy exit independent directors serve on boards to protect public shareholders when those directors feel compelled to resign because of an inability to carry out those duties effectively , investors should certainly take note but instead , they yawned ms dunlap said that she had fielded calls from only a halfdozen concerned investors after the letter was made public corinthian s stock fell just 19 percent friday mr berry certainly wins points for being so direct about his years at corinthian but do n't expect him to be deluged with calls to join other boards after all , a director with his kind of candor is not what today s mefirst managers want
warning long , pointy knives may be hazardous to your health the authors of an editorial in the latest issue of the british medical journal have called for knife reform the editorial , reducing knife crime we need to ban the sale of long , pointed kitchen knives , notes that the knives are being used to stab people as well as roasts and the odd tin of spam the authors of the essay drs emma hern , will glazebrook and mike beckett of the west middlesex university hospital in london called for laws requiring knife manufacturers to redesign their wares with rounded , blunt tips the researchers noted that the rate of violent crime in britain rose nearly 18 percent from 2003 to 2004 , and that in the first two weeks of 2005 , 15 killings and 16 nonfatal attacks involved stabbings in an unusual move for a scholarly work , the researchers cited a january headline from the daily express , a london tabloid britain is in the grip of knives terror third of murder victims are now stabbed to death dr hern said that we came up with the idea and tossed it into the pot to get people talking about crime reduction whether it s a sensible solution to this problem or not , i'm not sure in the united states , where people are more likely to debate gun control than knife control , partisans on both sides sounded amused wayne lapierre , executive vice president of the national rifle association , asked , are they going to have everybody using plastic knives and forks and spoons in their own homes , like they do in airlines \? peter hamm , a spokesman for the brady campaign to prevent gun violence , which supports gun control , joked , can sharp stick control be far behind \? he said people in his movement were envious of england for having such problems in america , we ca n't even come to an agreement that guns are dangerous and we should make them safer , he said the authors of the editorial argued that the pointed tip is a vestigial feature from less mannered ages , when people used it to spear meat they said that they interviewed 10 chefs in england , and that none gave a reason why the long , pointed knife was essential , though short , pointed knives were useful an american chef , however , disagreed with the proposal this is yet another sign of the coming apocalypse , said anthony bourdain , the executive chef at les halles and the author of kitchen confidential a knife , he said , is a beloved tool of the trade , and not a thing to be shaped by bureaucrats a chef s relationship with his knives develops over decades of training and work , he said , adding , its weight , its shape these are all extensions of our arms , and in many ways , our personalities he compared the editorial to efforts to ban unpasteurized cheese where there is no risk , he said , there is no pleasure
a large new study is providing good news about longterm survival for women with breast cancer standard chemotherapy and hormone treatment work even better than researchers had expected , the study found for middleaged women with an early stage of the disease , combining the treatments can halve the risk of death from breast cancer for at least 15 years for instance , a woman under 50 with a tumor big enough to feel , but not invading her lymph nodes , would have a 25 percent risk of dying of breast cancer in the next 15 years if she had surgery but no drug therapy adding both chemotherapy and hormone treatment would drop her risk to 116 percent among the most important findings was that a certain type of chemotherapy , already widely used , was most likely to save lives it included six months of the drug adriamycin , also called doxorubicin , or a related drug , epirubicin though the drugs cause hair loss and nausea , and in some cases heart problems , in the long run their benefits outweighed the risks , the studies found the greatest gains in survival came when the treatment also included five years of tamoxifen , a drug that blocks the effects of the hormone estrogen , which can feed some tumors but tamoxifen helps only women with estrogensensitive tumors , about 60 percent i think women should feel very encouraged by the progress that has been made , said dr sarah darby of oxford university , an author of a 30page report on the work that is being published today in the lancet , the british medical journal mortality rates are falling in the us and the uk , and are starting to fall in some other countries the study proves that drug therapy deserves credit for the dropping death rates , dr darby said the findings come from an analysis of 194 studies involving 145 , 000 women in two dozen countries the largest analysis ever of research results in cancer , and also one of the longest , with 15 years of followup in many cases the analysis was paid for by the british government , not drug companies the women in the studies all had relatively early cancers some were confined to the breast and some had spread to nearby lymph nodes , but none had reached other organs all the women had surgery , and some had radiation some had no drug treatment , but others had chemotherapy or hormone treatment , or both the use of chemotherapy varied because in the 1980 s , when many of the studies began , there was not enough evidence to tell whether women with early breast cancers needed drug treatment after surgery , and some doctors argued vehemently that they should not be exposed to the risks of chemotherapy all the studies included in the analysis were the type considered most reliable , known as randomized controlled trials , meaning that women were assigned at random to one treatment or another , and their outcomes compared an astonishing finding , dr darby said , is that the benefits of treatment actually increase over time , even after the treatment is done , so that the elevation in survival rates in women who took the drugs compared with those who did not is even greater after 10 to 15 years than it was after 5 years very few doctors would have guessed that beforehand , dr darby said for example , the study found that women under 50 who received chemotherapy \( not hormone treatment \) had a 157 percent death rate after five years , compared with 20 percent in women without chemotherapy but after 15 years , the difference was even greater , a full 10 percentage points a 324 percent death rate in treated women , compared with 424 percent in the controls older women also benefited , though not as much but not enough women 70 or over were included in the studies to determine the drugs' value for them the study also helps allay fears that delayed side effects from tamoxifen or chemotherapy might prove so deadly that women would in essence just be trading breast cancer for another cause of death that did not occur the increased risk of death linked to the drugs was only 02 percent dr stephen chia of the british columbia cancer agency , an author of a commentary on the study , said he expected further declines in death rates from breast cancer because newer drugs , already in widespread use , worked even better than the ones used in the studies on which today s findings were based
to the editor your article notes that dr sachs was profiled by numerous popular print and tv outlets for years it is extremely disturbing that while his publicity grew steadily , so did his malpractice record , but none of the media outlets featuring him bothered to check his history \( including the new york times , which featured him in a 2003 story about generous tippers \) media publicity lends doctors like dr sachs a sometimes unearned air of credibility and competence , luring in unknowing patients a doctor s history of discipline and malpractice verdicts and settlements should be easily available , so patients can make informed choices when picking doctors new york s system , while confusing and relatively unknown , is still better than those in many other states , which provide no information at all the national practitioner data bank , which lists malpractice histories , is closed to the public but should be opened furthermore , doctors who repeatedly commit malpractice should be automatically investigated before errors are allowed to multiply geoff boehm legal director center for justice democracy new york

springfield , nj to phil mickelson , it was a pretty easy shot easy for him , but certainly not for anybody in his gallery near baltusrol s sixth green his ball was in the adjacent 17th fairway , and he had to loft it over some towering trees , land it on the green and stop it quickly to have a chance to save a par 4 when he pulled that shot off , his ball spinning to within 5 feet of the cup , his gallery roared and rumbled as only a new york gallery can as he hurried through the gallery to the green , he was swarmed and surrounded and slapped with highfives when the cheers finally ceased , he missed the putt but his gallery still buzzed and when he completed a threeunderpar 67 to share the lead after the first round of the 87th pga championship , more cheers followed mickelson , the 35yearold lefty from san diego who has emerged as new york s pro over the years , other famous golfers have played and won \( or lost \) in the new york area , from bobby jones and walter hagen to arnold palmer , jack nicklaus , tom watson and tiger woods , but none of them were ever adopted by new york golf nuts the way phil mickelson has been they fell in love with him at the 2002 united states open at bethpage black , where he finished second to woods , and they thought he would win last year s open at shinnecock hills until he threeputted the 17th hole and now , with the pga championship here in new jersey s leafy suburbs about 20 miles west of times square , mickelson is again golf s man of the moment in the new york metropolitan area and he s lovin' it i just think the people here are awesome to play in front of , and they support so many great championships , that i really enjoy coming here and playing , he said later that was kind of cool there , going through the gallery after hitting right over them on that 482yard sixth hole , mickelson s drive crashed into a tree on the right and fell straight down instead of going for the green , he played down the 17th fairway to within 92 yards of the cup the tree was really not going to affect the shot any , because i left myself far enough back , he said it was just a good full lwedge and i was able to fly it on and spin it back to about 5 feet it just looked difficult despite the missed putt there to go one over par , mickelson birdied no 9 and no 10 , and also the 14th and the 18th holes , where he twoputted from 35 feet as doug steffen , the baltusrol pro , watched from behind the green mickelson had played here with steffen in an aug 1 practice round i just tried to pick up some tidbits on some of the greens , mickelson said how some greens break more than it looks standing behind the 18th green as mickelson putted out , steffen , the pro here the last nine years and earlier an assistant to bob ross for four years , talked about how he picked mickelson two years ago to win this pga championship with his ball flight and his game around the greens , this course is perfect for him , steffen said he can hit that little cut righttoleft shot during their aug 1 practice round , steffen told mickelson that the firmer the greens become , the more difficult they are to putt , because then the little subtleties are more likely to throw the putts off line we spent a lot of time talking about the mountain up there behind our upper course that adds little breaks to the lower course greens that you do n't see , he said of all the bigname pros , mickelson was the only one to ask steffen about baltusrol s intricacies that could make a difference come sunday i think the scoring is pretty much what i expected , steffen said i thought there might be a 65 or a 66 , but a lot of players can play this course the greens are so big , there are probably 30 guys capable of winning , and i still expect a playoff , because the guys are so jammed up if the pga s threehole cumulativescore playoff is needed , it will begin on the 194yard par3 fourth hole , continue on the 423yard par4 fifth and conclude on the 554yard par5 18th keep the fifth hole in mind , because that s one of the three holes , along with the sixth and the 430yard 15th , where mickelson s righttoleft tee shots flirt dangerously with the trees on the right it s not very difficult , said mickelson , who does n't feel that his lefttoright tee shot suits baltusrol s lower course it s just that i'm going to come very close to those trees on those holes they set up for a lefttoright shot , and i'm trying to play it a little righttoleft it s just three shots throughout the round i 'll try to hit it as straight as i can and hopefully catch the left side of the fairway he did that yesterday , wearing a cap instead of his usual visor a black cap at that but even in a black cap , he s new york s good guy through the trees , phil , a new york voice boomed , the man recalling the lofted wedge to the sixth green and extending his right arm as mickelson walked away from the 18th green you got everybody s hand but mine sorry , buddy too late phil mickelson was walking faster than a new york minute
having come within a single vote of conviction , a manhattan jury declared yesterday that it was hopelessly deadlocked and could not reach a verdict in the trial of bryan a conroy , a police officer who killed an unarmed man in a warehouse in chelsea in may 2003 just after noon on their sixth day of deliberations , 12 weary jurors declared in a note to justice daniel p fitzgerald of state supreme court that no further deliberations will resolve our differences justice fitzgerald then excused the panel , which formally ended the twoweek trial of officer conroy , who was charged with manslaughter in the shooting death of ousmane zongo , an unarmed african immigrant the case will be tried again two jurors interviewed yesterday said that the jury had recessed on friday with one lone holdout , a man who had a question of reasonable doubt but by the time they reconvened yesterday , that juror was joined by another juror , a woman , effectively destroying the hope of the 10 other men and women to reach a unanimous verdict , according to the jurors who were interviewed they spoke on the condition of anonymity , saying only that they were among the majority who voted to convict everybody likes resolutions , but some issues just do n't lend themselves to it , justice fitzgerald told the jurors at the end of the trial this event is probably one of them the emotional trial brought into a public courtroom questions about policing , excessive force and race in many ways , it ended in frustration for everyone , from officer conroy , whose fate will continue to hang in the balance until the outcome of a second trial , to prosecutors , who came close but ultimately fell short of proving that he recklessly caused mr zongo s death the outcome was perhaps bitterest for mr zongo s widow , salimata sanfo , who had come from her home in burkina faso , west africa , to be at the trial mr zongo , who worked as an art restorer in the warehouse , was 43 at the time of his death surrounded by relatives and supporters , her face streaked with tears , ms sanfo stood in the sun outside the courthouse and told reporters through a translator that she did not have a husband , and that her children do n't have a father the translator , cheick maiga , said ms sanfo has confidence in god and the judicial system everybody knows the truth , and the truth will come out officer conroy , she said through mr maiga , is a killer her lawyer , sanford rubenstein , who is representing mr zongo s family in a 150 million civil suit against the city , said , there is an obligation on the part of the district attorney to retry this and the family will be back for that prosecutors argued that officer conroy , 26 , was an ambitious rookie anxious to make an arrest and that he aggressively drew mr zongo into a lethal conflict when he encountered him in the warehouse on west 27th street during a raid on a counterfeit cd operation on may 22 , 2003 officer conroy , who did not take the stand , contends that he became locked in a struggle over his gun with mr zongo and was justified in shooting in interviews after the case was dismissed , several jurors described how close they came to convicting officer conroy the case was a difficult one , they said , because hard evidence was scant and the officer was the only witness jurors were forced to rely on officer conroy s testimony to a grand jury in 2004 , which they sifted through one juror said much of that account simply failed to convince them for example , he said , none of the jurors believed the officer s description of a first encounter with mr zongo in which he said the art restorer had lunged at him and then run away we knew he was lying , the juror said some of us used other words you know , like embellish one of the holdouts liked that word a lot on the other side , a lie is a lie and if you do n't believe that , then how can you believe anything else \? in his testimony , officer conroy said that he then pursued mr zongo to a different part of the warehouse , where a lifeordeath struggle took place another sticking point for the majority , that juror said , was why the officer had chased mr zongo to within an arm s length of his gun , even though he acknowledged knowing that mr zongo was not armed officer conroy testified that he fired twice just as he managed to jerk away from mr zongo , and that seconds later , he fired two more shots he never lost control of his gun , the juror said why are you still shooting at someone who does n't have a weapon \? the direction of the gunshot wounds in mr zongo s body also seemed to clash with officer conroy s testimony , the juror said ballistic evidence indicated that the bullets tore into mr zongo s body and traveled downward , indicating that officer conroy did not fire at mr zongo from his hip , as he said jurors said they were also troubled that at least one bullet hit mr zongo in the back even the central pillar of officer conroy s testimony his account of a lifeordeath struggle in which he said mr zongo had fought to get his gun was not believable for most of those jurors who said they had voted for conviction the majority of us thought he made an error in judgment , another juror said we feel on that day he acted unreasonably in causing the death of mr zongo we feel bad for him , the juror added about officer conroy we think he feels bad about it and he s just a kid he s a young man race barely came up as an issue in deliberations , jurors said , though it was very much on the minds of some people in the audience and outside the courthouse on centre street in lower manhattan after the jury was dismissed , supporters of mr zongo chanted just outside the courthouse and at least one person , cynthia davis , of the national action network , headed by the rev al sharpton , left the courtroom in tears i'm upset because i'm a black woman in america , ms davis said i'm just tired this is always happening the poor man was minding his own business and was shot down like an animal the shooting also drew attention from critics of city policing tactics , in part because it came just weeks after alberta spruill , 57 , died of cardiac arrest after a botched police raid in which officers broke down the door of her harlem and hurled a concussion grenade inside it has also been compared to the case of amadou diallo , in which four plainclothes officers shot mr diallo , an unarmed african immigrant , in the vestibule of a bronx apartment building in 1999 after mistaking him for a rape suspect when they shot mr zongo , we were getting ready to bury alberta , said cynthia howell , a relative of ms spruill who attended a portion of officer conroy s trial it was like , they did it again but patrick j lynch , president of the patrolmen s benevolent association , defended officer conroy it is never the intention to take a life , and there is no script when we go out on patrol , he said outside the courtroom yesterday difficult things happen , and many times there is a tragedy , and this time there was a tragedy all around officer conroy s lawyer , stuart london , said there was a life taken in this case , so there are no winners i do n't think it s a victory for either side the deliberations were tough , but the tone was always civilized , the jurors said even so , it was an emotional six days , and some jurors appeared visibly upset one was crying after they were dismissed and walked through the warm afternoon to lunch in a union square restaurant we kept a calm mind , one juror said we respected everyone s decision this was n't anything personal as for mr conroy , i feel badly for him , the other juror said i do n't believe he s a horrible person i do n't believe he s a racist he made a reckless mistake , but i respect the other jurors for their opinions , too
on a recent saturday afternoon , bonnie ralston and her husband , mark yarm , settled into a sofa at homecourt , a furniture store in cobble hill , brooklyn atop a nearby table , in a 30gallon aquarium , a little school of silvery killifish swayed and shimmered a transparent shrimp danced across a bed of colorful pebbles a blue crab batted at a golf ball with a fiery claw at first , the couple did n't seem particularly interested in these proceedings but they perked up when they learned that all of the aquarium s contents \( water included \) had been claimed a few blocks away from the gowanus canal , legendary among local residents as a reeking , toxic cesspool wow , said ms ralston , her eyes widening i had no idea her husband added , these are obviously very hardy fish sam ahmad , the store s owner and a lifelong resident of cobble hill , discovered life in the canal when he began kayaking there six months ago what hit home was seeing all these things you thought could never be there , he recalled when i was a kid , you could smell the canal from henry street the canal has long been renowned for smelling like an open sewer , which for most of its history it essentially was within decades after its construction in the 1860 s , the channel was swamped with untreated sewage from residential buildings and waste from manufacturing plants a flushing tunnel was installed in 1911 , but the propeller broke in the 1960 s , and the canal became the municipal equivalent of a putrid dish of leftovers pushed to the back of a refrigerator the propeller was finally repaired in 1999 since then , the odor has weakened considerably , and the area has been revitalized by an influx of residents , none more vital than those residing in the canal itself , who have reportedly thrived even in captivity we have n't lost anything to natural causes , mr ahmad said there 've only been murders violence does break out within the confines of the aquarium sometimes , for example , a crab will kill another crab but on the whole , the aquarium is decidedly peaceful , even homey mr ahmad built a tower of bricks for his amphibious fiddler crabs , and employs a team of snails as a cleaning crew he turned to the snails because he was concerned about the slimy green algae that was overrunning the tank to acquire them , he pulled his kayak alongside a muddy bank near degraw street , gathered a handful of snails and plopped them into a plastic water bottle while he was at it , he scooped some shrimp from beneath a log cloaked in seaweed he was not alone in his piscatorial ambitions at the mouth of the canal , a cormorant bobbed on the water , its black wings gleaming as it plunged into a streak of reflected amber sunlight saki knafo
three firefighters were killed yesterday in two blazes at opposite ends of new york city two in a desperate plunge from an apartment in the bronx as they tried to escape a fire that had burst through from the floor below , the other after he had become trapped in the basement of a burning house in brooklyn on a morning of swirling snow and brutal cold , the bronx fire escalated in a matter of minutes into a threealarm blaze that 150 firefighters struggled to bring under control officials suspected it began when sparks from an extension cord attached to a heater set fire to a mattress inside a thirdfloor apartment at 236 east 178th street in morris heights six firefighters rushed to the fourth floor after hearing that upstairs tenants might have been trapped back on the third floor , something went wrong officials described a sudden loss of water pressure in a hose and flames surged through the ceiling of the burning apartment , trapping the firefighters on the fourth floor mayday calls went out on their radios as the firefighters headed out the windows , hoping to survive two of the six men lt curtis w meyran , 46 , and firefighter john g bellew , 37 did not the four others were hospitalized with numerous broken bones the brooklyn fire broke out several hours later in a twofamily house at 577 jerome street in east new york where , fire officials said , people attending a birthday party reported smelling smoke firefighters from ladder company 103 headed into the basement , searching for the origin of the blaze and for anyone it might have trapped the cellar became so hot the firefighters decided they had no choice but to back out one firefighter , richard t sclafani , 37 , was left behind when the group retreated , fire officials said he had apparently been trying to make it to safety when something one fire official said equipment had become entangled with a coat rack prevented his escape his comrades , after taking a head count and going back for him , found him unconscious on the basement stairs he was taken to brookdale university hospital and medical center , and pronounced dead a short time later in all , yesterday was the deadliest day for the fire department since sept 11 , 2001 , when 343 members of the department died in the collapse of the world trade center , a catastrophe that continues to color much of the department s daily life only one firefighter had died in the line of duty since then , in what fire officials consider an extraordinary run of luck after the huge loss on 9 11 , a loss in experience that was felt in firehouses across the city the last time three firefighters died was four months before the sept 11 attack , when three men perished on father s day after an explosion in a burning building in astoria , queens but officials said that yesterday was different in a way that was unfamiliar in its grimness , even for seasoned firefighters none of us can remember a day when we had fatalities , fire fatalities , at two separate incidents , fire commissioner nicholas scoppetta said mayor michael r bloomberg described yesterday as a day we 'd all like to forget , but we will not the bronx fire was reported at 7 59 am alex hernandez , 45 , who lived on the second floor , said he was alerted by shouts and screams i heard somebody say , 'hey , the apartment is burning down' i heard everybody screaming 'fire ! fire !

martha stewart is in prison richard m scrushy , former chief executive of healthsouth , is sitting through jury selection at his fraud trial next week , bernard j ebbers , the former head of worldcom , will do the same in a court in manhattan , as will l dennis kozlowski , the former tyco chief being retried on grand larceny charges and if all goes according to plan , later this year enron s top managers , including kenneth l lay , its former chairman , will be on trial in houston , charged with a raft of crimes related to that company s demise it must seem , at least to courthouse watchers , that the sweeping effort to clean up corporate america begun over three years ago in the aftermath of the enron collapse is still going strong , perhaps even picking up steam but in the boardroom and executive suites , away from the gavels and juries , a different tale has begun to emerge the whitehot movement to overhaul corporate governance has cooled in recent months in washington and beyond , according to lawyers , institutional shareholders , executives , directors and other experts on that there is much agreement but the interpretations of this sudden , littlediscussed shift vary widely some experts complain that reform is slowing just as it is reaching what they say is a critical stage , while others argue that the change is the natural consequence of an effort that went too far in the first place the pendulum has begun to swing back , said john c coffee jr , a securities law professor at columbia university law school we are now seeing the counterreaction to the reform movement of the last few years what has emerged , experts from many sides of the issue said , is an intensifying battle over future efforts to revamp corporate governance further it is one that pits influential members of the business community , including giant organizations like the united states chamber of commerce and the business roundtable , against institutional investors pushing for greater power over the direction of troubled companies and it is an effort to handcuff regulators who , from the time of enron until just the last few months , have been able to issue new directives with little fear of confrontation the result , these experts said , is that 2005 could prove to be critical in determining which rules truly become embedded as part of the legal framework governing the future of how american business does its job with the level of the pushback and the momentum that the business community has , said ann yerger , executive director of the council of institutional investors , this is a very important year in terms of holding on to what we have and protecting what we have achieved in corporate reforms executives and other representatives of the business world agree that a change of attitude has taken hold , although they say that the shift is merely curbing the excesses of regulation they bemoan a combination of heightened action by agencies like the securities and exchange commission , aggressive enforcement efforts by state attorneys general like eliot spitzer in new york , and intensified litigation by plaintiffs' lawyers , who recently have begun to see new success with settlements that held directors of worldcom and enron personally liable the pendulum has gone too far , said david hirschmann , a senior vice president who serves as point man at the chamber of commerce in washington on the top issues facing american businesses there have been some unintended consequences that are having significant negative impacts on our economy , and we need to fix those aspects that were n't done right mr hirschmann said that the unintended consequences have included unnecessary expenditures by companies to meet the bureaucratic demands of new rules , decisions by companies to postpone certain technology purchases to avoid running afoul of new compliance requirements , and a decline in the number of foreign companies willing to list on american stock exchanges indeed , the new york stock exchange has reported a dropoff in new foreign listings in recent years , including the loss of one giant initial public offering for air china , whose executives were reported to chafe under the rigorous new demands in the american market none of this means that corporate america will be returning to the complacency of the preenron days and indeed , the criminal and civil pursuit of corporate wrongdoers continues at a breakneck pace the justice department s corporate fraud task force , formed by executive order of the president in the immediate aftermath of the worldcom debacle , has racked up an impressive series of victories by june 2004 , the latest period for which full statistics are available , the task force had obtained more than 500 corporate fraud convictions or guilty pleas , and charged more than 900 defendants , including more than 60 top corporate officers , with various types of fraud during that period , the sec filed almost 600 separate civil enforcement actions involving financial fraud or reporting as the big fraud trials unfold over the coming months , public anger may build as the excesses of the bubble years some of which have reached almost mythic status are again trotted out juries will hear about the multibilliondollar accounting scams at worldcom and healthsouth , with executives at both companies purportedly scrambling to disguise numbers revealing the failure of their business plans in the trial of mr kozlowski , the 6 , 000 shower curtain will again be raised , along with other indulgences he obtained with money that prosecutors will contend was stolen from tyco and the enron trials will examine that company s byzantine offbooks partnerships , which were used to disguise its deteriorating business and enrich some executives no matter the public mood , however , certain aspects of the changes adopted in recent years are here to stay , experts said in particular the themes from the sweeping sarbanesoxley act , passed in the summer of 2002 in hopes of cleaning up corporate america that law rewrote the rules for corporate governance and financial reporting , requiring greater power for independent directors , fewer conflicts for outside auditors and greater transparency in reporting those concepts are now so ingrained in the corporate mindset that they are unlikely to be reversed , and may well already be showing some benefits to the economy , particularly in the return of investor confidence and the recent growth of mergers and acquisitions activity , experts said part of the resurgence in the mergers and acquisition market is due to greater confidence among buyers that they can now trust public financials more than they were willing to right after the scandals , said r franklin balotti , director in the corporate department at richards , layton finger , a law firm in wilmington , del if part of the result of sarbanesoxley and the rest of the rules is to give the market more confidence in the public statements about the value of companies , then perhaps it has all been worthwhile signs of the growing battle over corporate reform and its ultimate politicization are everywhere , although many are hidden from public view soon after the presidential election , a group of senior financial executives from an array of firms and companies visited the white house for a private meeting with president bush according to people briefed on the meeting , the executives voiced their frustration with the intensity of the regulatory and legal efforts that their companies had faced since the corporate scandals broke three years ago the regulatory battle has turned to the courts the chamber of commerce has sued the sec over rules it adopted related to governance of mutual funds the group also threatened to sue if the agency approved rules to give corporate shareholders the ability to nominate board members directly the proposal is now widely viewed as dead at the same time , corporate lawyers expressed dismay that the sec commissioners had recently elected to reject the recommendation of the enforcement staff to levy a fine against gary winnick , the founder and former chairman of global crossing , the onetime fiber optic giant that collapsed into bankruptcy it was absolutely amazing , because the commission rarely turns away from a staff recommendation like that , said one corporate lawyer involved in the case , who spoke on condition of anonymity there is even growing criticism about the costs and demands of sarbanesoxley , particularly in relation to the demands of section 404 of the act , which imposes numerous requirements and disclosure demands to ensure that internal controls against fraud are effective already , while there is widespread support for the principles of sarbanesoxley , corporate directors and other experts said that there was a quiet effort under way to trim back the demands of the law it s clear to me that we are heading into some very uncertain waters , and that the bush administration is willing to cut big business a lot of slack when it comes to corporate governance , which i think is a big mistake , said james w harris , president and chief executive of seneca financial , a merchant banking firm mr harris also serves on two other corporate boards in recent months , mr harris said , he has heard numerous directors complaining about the demands they now face for serving on boards , an attitude he says he has little patience with i was at a meeting of a group of directors back in the fall , and there was a lot of grumbling and groaning about all the extra work required now , he said my response was , 'why do n't you give back the check and get off the board \? ' of course , none of them wanted to do that the signs of a changing attitude in washington and beyond are being read with some level of dismay by experts in corporate governance they believe that establishing rules for board independence was just an important first step but one that will have little serious impact unless shareholders are given greater power to remove ineffective directors board independence , while beneficial , is insufficient to provide directors with affirmative incentives to focus on the interest of shareholders , said lucian bebchuk , director of the program on corporate governance at harvard law school and an author of pay without performance the problem , according to professor bebchuk and others , is that shareholders the true owners of a corporation are virtually powerless to effect change in a board unless they begin expensive and hardtowin proxy battles shareholders are not given the right to vote for an alternative candidate for director , or to vote against one advanced by the company they can either vote yes , or not vote at all responding to such concerns , the sec proposed rules essentially allowing shareholders to propose their own candidates for director in companies with proven weaknesses in their procedures for electing directors at the time it was introduced , william h donaldson , the sec chairman , heralded the proposal as a significant step quickly , the proposal brought widespread opposition from the business community , which argued that the effort was intended to allow unions with huge stakes in corporations through their pension funds to force social policy issues to the forefront on corporate boards we think introducing a specialinterest agenda into the boardroom is n't good governance or good for shareholders , said mr hirschmann of the chamber of commerce but some managers of public pension funds say their desire for a greater voice is simply about giving the real owners of a company a say now , about the only option available is to sue the company and its directors we should have some alternative to just being forced to sue ourselves , said gary findlay , executive director of the missouri state employees retirement system , a pension fund if we are simply taking proceeds from the corporation that we already own to pay ourselves , that does n't effect meaningful change correction january 15 , 2005 , saturday a chart in business day yesterday with an article about the pace of reform in corporate america referred incorrectly in some copies to a charge against the former tyco executives l dennis kozlowski and mark h swartz they have been charged with looting the company neither has been charged with insider trading the chart also misstated the number of people who have pleaded guilty to wrongdoing at enron it is 14 , not 13
meulaboh , indonesia , jan 10 a race is under way here to keep this seaside city that lost so many lives to the ocean from losing any more the earthquake and tsunami on dec 26 killed at least 6 , 000 people in meulaboh but it also knocked out two of the three water treatment plants here , leaving the survivors without enough safe drinking water at the largest of the plants the main intake pipe snapped , and the underground lines that carry the water from the meureubo river to the plant have countless cracks that would be a tough situation for any city but meulaboh , once home to 70 , 000 people , has been almost entirely cut off from the rest of aceh province the main road that once linked it to nearby banda aceh was destroyed , making it impossible to deliver drinking water by tanker truck or even the heavyduty equipment that would normally be needed to make such extensive repairs right now , what we got is less than enough water to sustain human life , it is as simple as that , said les collins , a water treatment expert from queenstown , new zealand , who is one of three people leading the emergency repair effort it is a colorful group mr collins , who was brought in by the british charity oxfam , is working with the local utility plant maintenance foreman , zuardi , and a boyfaced , guncarrying , indonesian military officer , maj suardi , who is assigned to keep a watchful eye on the progress the spanish red cross has been involved , too , playing an essential early role by setting up a temporary water treatment system that is producing just enough to fill the utility s small fleet of tanker trucks , which are constantly touring the city and passing out water at the homeless shelters and to families in need the repair work , like so much about the extraordinary relief effort in asia , has been distinguished by unpredictable , often frustrating problems whose solutions require the improvisational skills of a jazz master i igo vila led the spanish red cross s immediate response to the water crisis mr vila , a veteran disaster response manager from madrid , arrived with his team of five in meulaboh on jan 2 and set up swimmingpoollike chlorination tanks at the main plant that started processing drinking water three days later by monday , they were producing enough to send out tanker trucks 42 times a day enough to ration out drinking water , but not to meet all the city s needs this has got to be the toughest job i have ever done , said mr vila , who is living in a tent behind the plant but at least we are producing water the oxfam crew , meanwhile , at first planned to follow the agency s usual routine setting up drinking water storage systems , as well as latrines at camps for the homeless but the local authorities had something else in mind could oxfam go a step further and help them restart their broken and underperforming treatment plants \? that is where mr collins came in a series of catastrophic floods in new zealand in recent years together with his fastpaced style earned him a reputation back home as the goto guy for drinking water emergencies that status earned him his role in the relief effort a singapore armed forces helicopter airlifted the oxfam crew consisting of mr collins and three others on sunday afternoon from banda aceh to meulaboh by late sunday , mr collins , who had made some earlier preliminary inspections , had already improvised a repair strategy for the main plant mr collins observed that the river water was more clear than it was cloudy turbidity is fine , he said it is treatable a new generator should be dropped near the river , he pronounced , so an intake pump could be started to identify cracks in underground pipe that delivers water to the plant before beginning repairs he said work crews should be sent to the most devastated part of the city to salvage pipe that could be used to reconnect the otherwise functional treatment plant to the river mr collins said oxfam was prepared to commit 500 , 000 to the project all the rapidfire plotting left mr zuardi exhausted i am tired of speaking with you , he finally declared , addressing mr collins most of the oxfam team slept sunday night on the hard tile floor in the treatment plant office , where mosquitoes buzzed in the air and aftershocks rumbled along the ground mr collins would have none of that he took refuge in one of the tanker trucks , where he sprayed a generous cloud of insect repellent and then reclined across the seats for the night it was shortly after dawn on monday when the third key player in the repair effort arrived , in his camouflage uniform and boots and with a beltmounted revolver major suardi beckoned mr collins to join him in the parking lot the indonesian government , he said , had decided that the plans must change oxfam would no longer be working at the main plant , where the spanish would continue to operate their portable purification operation instead , the government wanted oxfam to fix the two other plants , including one that had been almost destroyed major suardi accompanied the oxfam team , along with mr zuardi , as they inspected the two other facilities , on a jeep ride that started off in near silence apa kabar , mr collins said , jokingly trying out one of two indonesian phrases he had learned this one meaning how are you \? the cigarettes soon came out , and within minutes , a certain camaraderie was established among the three the men talked about their families , with major suardi pulling out a picture of his wife by the time they arrived at the plant , he was showing off his knowledge of american pop culture , singing a line from san francisco \( be sure to wear some flowers in your hair \) the devastation at the second plant was complete the earthquake had cracked the controlroom building in half the waters from the tsunami had toppled two primary pieces of treatment equipment and the nearby river was now running so high , after an overnight downpour , that it looked as if the plant would soon be flooded again it would have to be rebuilt almost from scratch or simply abandoned , mr collins concluded , a project that was probably beyond oxfam s means the third plant was still in service , but a tent city for 2 , 000 tsunami victims was being built next door the plant s output , major suardi declared , must be expanded mr collins soon had a recipe grab the filter , the generator motor and one of the tanks from the ruined plant and move them , as well as equipment that can send more water through the samesize pipe its capacity could then be increased significantly in a matter of weeks the project was back on track in addition , oxfam has secured two giant russianmade helicopters , which are expected to begin delivering water and sanitation supplies to meulaboh in the next few days we can do something with this , mr collins said we can work with this
last summer , brad glas , captain of the hellcat ii , a 114foot fishingparty boat out of groton , was about to head home through the race , the challenging currentdriven nexus of long island and block island sounds unexpectedly , mr glas spotted a kayaker in a deepwater shipping lane listening to his boat s radio , mr glas said he heard two tankers were on their way and he said , oh my god calculating the tankers' speed , mr glas figured they would reach the slowmoving kayaker in about 13 minutes he alerted the kayaker and tankers and a possible collision was averted in the past few years , the popularity of kayaking has zoomed per capita , connecticut has ranked near the top nationally in the number of people trying kayaking along the coast and on inland waters , said mike lee , spokesman for the outdoor industry association about 156 , 000 residents had tried sea and recreational kayaking at least once in connecticut , mr lee said , citing a 2002 association survey , the latest figures available nearly 40 , 000 residents have experienced whitewater kayaking but as more people paddle into marine waters , encounters like mr glas s are growing , according to the connecticut state department of environmental protection , kayakers themselves and captains of fishing and lobster boats most people kayak on the state s calmer waters inland and close to the coast but some are going far offshore to long island , block island , fishers island and other smaller isles meanwhile , other boaters are reporting more close calls in the boat channels of harbors and rivers , feeding coastal waters we 're seeing more and more kayaks out on long island sound , and that is a real concern for us , said eleanor c mariani , the department of environmental protection s state boatinglaw administrator ms mariani also expects the number of close calls to rise , although so far , no collisions have been reported such nearcollisions worry officials at the coast guard , the state department of environmental protection , ferry services and others in the boating community the issue also is dismaying connecticut s most skilled kayakers , who say weekend warriors are hurting the sport s reputation they 're jumping on the bandwagon to do something cool , because it s the latest thing , without respecting the sport , said michele sorensen , a fulltime kayaking instructor in norwalk during the past few summers , the coast guard has launched six searchandrescue operations for kayakers , said chief chris hartzog of the coast guard sector covering long island , block and fishers island sounds and up the connecticut river to hartford the number of deaths related to kayaking has remained low , with two or so per year because kayaks are n't registered , the state does n't know how many kayaks are here concerns of offshore collisions are exaggerated , said jay babina of branford , secretary of connyak , a kayaking club a chief worry is the lowslung crafts' visibility even on a clear day , with a small to moderate chop of one to three feet waves , it s difficult to see a kayak , said john annino , supervisor of the dep s boating education section safety guidelines advise kayakers to wear bright life jackets , put reflector tape on their boats and paddles and use vividlycolored craft some local lobstermen refer to kayaks as speed bumps you do n't see them , until you hit them , said george main , who runs a lobster boat , west cove , out of noank they should not be out there in bad weather or poor visibility , he said when bad weather restricts visibility , boats depend on radar but on radar , kayaks are virtually invisible we ca n't see these things on radar , said claude adams , captain of the 41foot charter boat lady margaret , out of new london we 've encountered them in the fog , mr adams said someday a big tug will run them over and wo n't even know they did it or some yacht unlike most other small craft , most kayaks are n't equipped with radar reflectors small sailboats carry reflectors on their masts , far above water level but placing a mastlike pole on a kayak would destroy its navigability a coast guard study in maine showed some results with people wearing radar reflectors on their heads how many people are going to do that \? asked ms mariani kayak manufacturers are just beginning to address the problem , said matt menashes , executive director of the professional paddlesports association , a trade group worried about kayakers , officials at cross sounds ferry in new london , which serves long island and block island , last year upgraded their two highspeed ferries with thermalimaging cameras , said stan mickus , cross sounds' public affairs director ocean kayakers also have been expanding their range with the aid of portable gps units that help them navigate , but not detect other boats around them and that is worsening the visibility issue , said some captains and peter boynton , coast guard captain of the port of new haven with a gps unit , said mr glas they do n't know what s around them and that s the problem it does n't matter if its my 134 tons of steel is coming down on them or a 900foot tanker it does n't much matter , dead is dead the coast guard s rules also advise kayakers to alert other ships by radio on a marine frequency if they plan to cross shipping lanes but , how many kayakers carry a vhs radio \? almost none , said captain boynton
san antonio , sept 16 little does the national football league know that everybody s new favorite team could really be a bunch of squirrel eaters that is the accusation levied by new orleans saints guard kendyl jacox against tackle wayne gandy standing in the middle of the saints' locker room at the alamodome on thursday , the 325pound jacox announced that the 315pound gandy had hunted , cooked and devoured various forms of wildlife commonly thought of as roadkill i'm from haines city , fla , gandy said so i guess i was liable to shoot a squirrel with my bb gun every now and again , and maybe throw it in a little bit of hot grease anybody rooting for the saints is starting to learn something about them , bite by unpredictable bite besides the fact that at least one of their linemen has eaten fried squirrel and that the entire organization has been forced out of new orleans by hurricane katrina , the saints can seem at first glance almost nondescript , a team that appears capable of finishing 88 for the rest of time they have the 50 million tailback \( deuce mcallister \) , the outspoken receiver \( joe horn \) , the quarterback who divides public opinion \( aaron brooks \) and the owner who wants a new stadium \( tom benson \) , all required but hackneyed roles in today s nfl but the saints also have a personality as distinguishable as their fleurdelis logo and as colorful as the city where they used to play take , for instance , defensive end charles grant , who drives a purpleandyellow 1975 chevrolet impala with a picture of a woman painted on the trunk next to the words , mo money , mo problems we do n't have a lot of guys doing pr work here , grant said we 're always making fun of each other we really like to make fun of how each other s bodies are made when teammates see grant coming , they point at his protruding belly when they see offensive lineman jermane mayberry , they slip on tshirts two sizes too small everybody thinks my shirts are too tight , mayberry said on this team , you 've always got to be peeking at yourself in the mirror players sometimes call receiver donte' stallworth static shock because of his electric dreadlocks they taunt defensive end will smith about his northeastern accent i do n't even have an accent , said smith , who is from utica , ny but they think everybody who s not from the south sounds funny the saints can adequately represent the country because they are so clearly from the country their hometowns include colquitt , ga clover , sc opelousas , la bruce , miss and millbrook , ala only one player on the active roster grew up in new orleans , but more than half are from the south , as downhome as the nfl can get on days off , linemen like to drive a caravan of classic cars down backroads in louisiana on saturdays , they take turns disparaging the big ten in favor of the southeastern conference in san antonio , they lament the lack of quality barbecue and argue over the definition of a chalupa i really miss my grill , jacox said if i had my smoker right now , i 'd smoke anything , maybe even squirrel if you have n't had smoked meat , you have n't had meat jacox s grill is perhaps the least significant casualty of hurricane katrina , and the saints are perhaps the least inconvenienced evacuees from new orleans they stay at a hotel on the riverwalk , have meetings at a local convention center and practice at a high school that has two football fields they get directions from the concierge and daily encouragement from the shoeshiner i feel like we 're coming together here , cornerback fakhir brown said i feel like we 've already won the super bowl the organization has never even been to a super bowl , which suggests its players have never been spoiled the saints , who have contributed little to football history beyond archie manning and the who dat \? chant , hardly complain about their makeshift weight room at the alamodome , their daily bus rides and their socalled home game monday night against the giants at the meadowlands the nfl is filled with teams the giants included who are famously uptight about their schedules and fanatical about their routines those are generally the organizations best suited to winning championships , but the saints are probably best equipped to weathering this storm players attributed their seasonopening victory at carolina in part to their flexibility and in part to their sense of humor they took their role in the recovery effort seriously , but not too seriously we are the kind of group that will keep a smile on each other s faces no matter what , cornerback fred thomas said if you 're wearing something funny , if you 're doing something funny , it s going to get pointed out nothing is off limits the saints can list a handful of reasons for the world to love them , none of which have anything to do with the hurricane they do not think of themselves as victims , survivors or charity cases they prefer to be known as clowns , and they understand the true meaning of the word if clowns bring happiness and laughter to places filled with pain and tears , then they are doing their job , whether they wear eye black or makeup i think everywhere you go in this league , you 're going to find clowns , said running back antowain smith , who won two super bowls with the new england patriots we just have a lot more clowns here as smith rattled off all the differences between the saints and the patriots it could have taken him most of the afternoon defensive back fred booker leapt out of his chair at the next locker cockoroach ! booker said having survived a hurricane , booker bravely swept the insect away and watched it crawl toward another locker if only jacox had his grill
it would be safe to assume that the man in 6f did not have many friends or relatives , or at least none who called or visited regularly no one , not even his neighbors , noticed his absence for a number of weeks that is , not until a putrid odor began filling the hallways of the queensbridge houses in long island city consuelo sanchez , 55 , whose apartment is adjacent to 6f , complained about the smell for weeks before housing authority officials unlocked the door to discover the decomposed body on a sofa , the television still burbling away the occupant , an 86yearold retired transit worker , had died a month earlier of natural causes i kept telling them , 'the man is dead , ' ms sanchez said i was hoping i was n't right the medical examiner removed the bulk of the remains , but it was up to ronald gospodarski to take care of the rest , most of them viscous and indescribably malodorous the man in 6f had largely soaked into the sofa cushions as his body decayed , and his gastric acid had melted through the plastic covering on the upholstery i do n't care if you 're black , white , rich or poor , whether you live in the projects or a penthouse , everyone smells the same when they die , mr gospodarski said as he scraped a caramelcolored goo off the floor of apartment 6f this spring mr gospodarski , a paramedic for 23 years , is what is known as a biorecovery technician , a highly trained , extremely efficient , selfemployed housecleaner of sorts whose specialty is removing the unpleasant aftereffects of suicides , attempted suicides , shotgun murders , accidental impalements and , in the case of lonely , unnoticed passings like that of the man in 6f , decomps in a city like new york , mr gospodarski and his six employees are rarely idle in recent months , they have mopped up a mailroom clerk who jumped from the 38th floor of an office building , sterilized a piece of filtration equipment that took the life of a water company employee and cleaned up after a boyfriend put a bullet through the head of a staten island mother as she made shrimp gumbo in her kitchen his company , biorecovery corporation , is the only business based in new york that specializes in such matters there are a couple of similar cleanup companies with offices outside new york , but biorecovery dominates the business in the city , mainly through word of mouth it operates from a building that sits across the street from a cemetery in queens everyone is dying to see us , said mr gospodarski , 43 , a jovial , talkative man who requires little prompting to recount some of his more memorable jobs , all of which he records in photographs that he keeps on his computer to show to visitors it was mr gospodarski who dealt with the mayhem of the wendy s restaurant massacre in 2000 that left five people dead in queens and the triple murder that took place a year later above the carnegie deli in manhattan biorecovery also tackled the anthrax contamination of the new york post and abc news and the sterilization of the regal princess , a cruise ship whose passengers were sickened by the norwalk virus in 2003 but the meatandpotatoes of mr gospodarski s business is unheralded deaths , like that of a troubled teenager who shot himself in the basement of his parents' richmond hill home in september or the quiet demise of elderly new yorkers in the case of the man in 6f , his extended period of decay fouled every item in his apartment , requiring that everything , even sections of the floor , be removed and discarded i 've had guys left dead for months , where fluid seeped down six floors and everything had to be torn out , mr gospodarski said you ca n't leave one drop of blood or body fluid or the place will stink in most cases , he said , postmortem cleanup is quick and simple wiping down bloodsplattered walls , ripping out soiled carpet but it is a job that would undoubtedly prove burdensome to grieving relatives most of the time we 're simply providing psychological comfort , mr gospodarski said people who commit suicide do n't think about what they 're going to leave behind biorecovery s services start at 600 for cases of minimal decomposition and reach into the thousands for more extensive mayhem the company generally uses industrialstrength cleanser , but its newest service involves superheating an entire apartment , which kills odorproducing microbes and eliminates the need to throw every last painting , book and piece of electronic equipment in the trash the minimum cost for that procedure is 3 , 000 the new york state crime victims board will pay up to 2 , 500 for cleaning up after a homicide , and many car insurance policies cover the price of restoring the interior of vehicles whose passengers wind up on the wrong end of a gun mr gospodarski said he never turns anyone away , even if the client cannot pay we never leave anyone hanging , he said without apparent irony nearly all of his jobs come from referrals from police officers , prosecutors and paramedics he does not , he said , call grieving families whose loss he gleans from newspaper accounts biorecovery started in mr gospodarski s apartment in 1998 after his years as a paramedic , mr gospodarski said , he was bothered by what he saw on the job ambulance crews would take away a body and leave behind a disturbing pile of latex gloves , syringes and bloodsoaked gauze the detectives who often followed would ring the scene with yellow police tape and spray fingerprint dust around every light switch and door knob i 've seen the medical examiner leave behind pieces of brain , he said grieving families should n't have to deal with that mr gospodarski and his crew are alternately philosophical and vulgar , cracking jokes about the gore in their midst , or about the housekeeping habits of the deceased last week , as they cleaned up the blood of chantel curtis , the staten island woman who was shot by a boyfriend who then killed himself , mr gospodarski could not help noticing the details of her life the treadmill in the living room , the vase of roses on the table and the joyful clutter of children s toys why ca n't these people just kill themselves and leave everyone else alone \? he asked , his eyes pausing on a photograph of the victim and her young son it comes as some relief to biorecovery s workers that many cleanups are limited to tiled bathrooms a fair number of suicides are carried out in bathtubs , and many elderly people , beset by illness , will retreat to a bathroom to die , often on the toilet , the workers said manny sosa , like many employees , said he had become inured to death he once retched during a cleanup that required him to handle entrails , but by now he can eat lunch on the job sometimes we play detective and try to figure out what happened , said mr sosa , 26 i actually look forward to coming to work while they may be accustomed to gore , even the hardiest among the crew were unnerved by a recent job that required them to clean out a house in the bronx that had been used for santeria , the south american and caribbean religion that involves the ritual slaughter of animals the practitioners had defaulted on their mortgage , leaving the bank to deal with whatever mysteries lurked in the dank basement mr gospodarski s workers , dressed in biohazard suits , sifted through soil and discovered animal hoofs , desiccated snakes , razor blades and bottles of liquid marked with the international symbol for poison the workers , most of them from latin america and the west indies , were clearly scared at one point , mr sosa unearthed what appeared to be a clump of human hair , and the crew s collective shudder was palpable i do n't like this one bit , mr sosa said i 'd rather be dealing with a gunshot victim the summer months were unusually slow , and mr gospodarski said he was looking forward to winter , when violence tends to move indoors bloodshed is more common in the summer , but there is little money to be made from gunplay that stains the pavement with winter , however , people end up packed into tiny apartments throw

the city s rent guidelines board approved increases of up to 55 percent for renewal leases on the city s one million rentstabilized apartments last night the increases , the smallest in three years , reflected a slower rise in landlords' costs at a typically boisterous public meeting , in which tenant advocates battled building owners in a two hour shouting match , the ninemember board said the 55 percent increase would apply to twoyear leases on apartments in which landlords pay for heat tenants in those apartments who sign oneyear leases will receive 275 percent increases for tenants who pay for their own heat and those in rentstabilized lofts , the board approved slightly smaller increases of 45 percent on twoyear leases and 225 percent on oneyear leases in all cases , the increases will apply to leases renewed from oct 1 of this year through sept 30 , 2006 the meeting , at cooper union in manhattan and attended by about 400 people , came a month after the board released a study called the price index of operating costs , which analyzed landlords' costs for things like utilities and insurance it found that costs rose last year , but at a slower pace than in the previous two years that led some tenants' advocates to argue even more strenuously than usual for a rent freeze or a sharp slowing of rent increases the board set the maximum increase at 65 percent last year and 75 percent in 2003 in 2002 , the maximum was 4 percent after a series of meetings in recent weeks , board members had recommended that this year s maximum increase fall between 4 percent to 7 percent although its 55 percent maximum increase was in the middle of that range , it was a compromise that appeared to satisfy almost no one in the audience , and struck a predictable note of discord among some members of the board the rent guidelines board , created in 1968 to review and adjust rents on all stabilized apartments annually , includes two members who represent tenants , two who represent building owners and five who represent the public at large as they have almost every year , the representatives of tenants and landlords set the tone of the meeting with proposals widely out of step with the final outcome david d pagan , a tenants' representative , moved for a rent freeze , which was soundly defeated steven j schleider , a representative of building owners , countered with a proposal of increases up to 7 percent , with several other provisions to defray landlords' costs , like an additional 6 percent increase for tenants who have occupied the same apartment for 10 years it , too , was rejected as a public meeting , the session verged on theater , with dozens of audience members jumping from their seats , chanting and shouting slogans so loudly that the board chairman , marvin markus , who ultimately proposed the package of increases that was approved , had to struggle to be heard harold a lubell , another of the owners' representatives , suggested rhetorically at one point that landlords might feel slighted if they did not receive the same price controls as their tenants why do n't we freeze real estate taxes , the price of oil and water charges \? he said tenant advocates may not have been surprised by the outcome , but none seemed willing to say they were satisfied the majority of new yorkers have not seen an increase in their incomes , said adriene l holder , a lawyer at the legal aid society and one of the tenants' representatives on the board i did n't expect to see a zero increase , she said after the vote but i ca n't believe that in this , of all years , we could n't get a lower increase
it seemed at first like a normal ride six executives from the nation s largest credit card company had climbed aboard their corporate helicopter on friday afternoon , heading back to headquarters in delaware from a routine meeting in new york a few grabbed magazines for the flight others chatted the heliport at 34th street and the east river was busy at the end of the week they stowed their briefcases in the luggage rack and then took off as the sikorsky s76c rose some 30 feet then turned up the river for the trip , no one suspected a thing it was a normal takeoff and departure , said lance l weaver , chief administrative officer of mbna corporation , who was aboard the flight what happened next , however , as related by mr weaver in a phone call with reporters yesterday , was a near disaster the helicopter landed in the river , flipped over and began to sink its cabin rushing full of water as its frightened passengers struggled to open the door remarkably , none of the passengers and only one of the pilots was seriously injured in the crash it was the second helicopter to have ditched in the east river in a week speaking to reporters during a conference call from wilmington , del , mr weaver , 50 , said he knew there was something wrong when the helicopter started to shake and lose altitude not more than 30 seconds after liftoff the two pilots blair e payton , 42 , and mark p schaberg , 56 managed to set the helicopter on the river without much of a crash , he said but then the aircraft turned upside down and began to sink it was for me a bit of surreal experience where you think momentarily this ca n't be happening , mr weaver said then you realize very quickly that it is happening as the helicopter flipped over , he said , the passengers suddenly found themselves upside down in a small cabin filling rapidly with water the chief executive of mbna , bruce l hammonds , 57 , was sitting on a bench facing the front of the aircraft with two colleagues , douglas r denton , 58 , and thomas d wren , 53 behind them , on seats that faced the rear of the helicopter , were three other passengers richard k struthers , 50 frank d bramble , sr , 57 and mr weaver the cabin was submerged , full of water , and we were all holding our breath , mr weaver said we were completely disoriented i knew we needed to get that door open mr struthers , he said , was closest to the door and somehow managed to throw the latch i heard the pop of the door , mr weaver said , and then the helicopter rocked under water as the pressure was released i threw the weight of my whole body against the door , and the door sprung open all told , he said , they had been underwater for what felt like a minute but even as they managed to escape , the river currents pulled them off mr weaver said the currents were so intense , he was swept from the sinking craft as he looked back , he said , he saw mr struthers grab the helicopter s tail section and help mr wren and mr bramble escape at that point , there was not much more to do , he said , but fight the currents and swim to shore along the eastside drive , he said , several people out for a walk or a jog climbed a high metal fence and rushed down the embankment , reaching down to pull him out other passersby and a large force of rescue workers helped to save the remaining passengers and pilots the stars aligned in such a way that we were all saved , mr weaver said indeed , only mr schaberg , the pilot , remained hospitalized at bellevue hospital center in critical but stable condition yesterday afternoon , according to the hospital officials from the national transportation safety board said at a press conference yesterday that they were in the early stages of an investigation talking to witnesses , looking for surveillance tapes and examining pilot and maintenance records and , of course , the helicopter itself the officials said an initial report would be released in about a week a final report could take as long as a year louis freeh , general counsel of mbna , profusely thanked the citizens and rescue workers of new york for their help in saving his colleagues mr freeh said he hoped to meet in the coming days with mayor michael r bloomberg to figure out some official way to thank the city the coincidence of two crashes in a week seemed to have little effect at the city s heliports yesterday at the downtown manhattan heliport , at pier 6 and the east river , helicopters were landing and taking off regularly the liberty helicopter pad , at 12th avenue and 30th street , was even busier you know , it s like crossing the street , said yann tanini , 27 , of astoria , queens , who had just returned from an airborne tour of the city actually , crossing the street is more dangerous , he said

washington , oct 24 top federal health officials acknowledged monday that there were some spot shortages of flu vaccine this year but said that overall supplies should be adequate some doctors and public health clinics have said they have limited supplies of flu vaccines this year but health and human services secretary michael o leavitt and other top health officials said this situation should change in the coming weeks we expect that where they lack vaccines , the situation will improve , said dr julie l gerberding , director of the centers for disease control and prevention this is the same pattern that we see every year , and over time we will catch up eight states have reported flu cases , a normal level at this point , dr gerberding said flu season usually peaks in january and february , she said , and so people have many weeks to be vaccinated dr anthony s fauci , director of the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases , said flu vaccine supplies were tight because the country was in a transition period as more people decide to be vaccinated against the flu every year , vaccine supplies will become more abundant and reliable , dr fauci said this change will also help if a pandemic were to strike , he said in the wake of a supply crunch last year , federal health officials had told doctors that through this past sunday they were to vaccinate only the elderly , the very young , the sick and health care providers on monday , however , vaccines were made available to all federal officials said 70 million to 88 million doses of flu vaccines should be available this year , with much of the supply being rolled out in the coming weeks in the past , interest in being vaccinated has declined sharply after the second week in december , so vaccine supplies that arrived late in the season have sometimes been discarded thus , the timing of flu vaccine shipments is crucial mr leavitt also took care to distinguish between fears of a bird flu that could cause millions of deaths worldwide and the annual effects of the seasonal flu he said the bush administration was in the midst of revising its longawaited plan for dealing with an outbreak of a pandemic of avian flu but he pointed out that the seasonal flu was also dangerous it kills an average of 36 , 000 americans a year , leads 200 , 000 americans to be hospitalized and causes countless lost school and work days , he said much of this can be prevented by simply getting a flu shot dr andrew c von eschenbach , the acting commissioner of the food and drugs , also announced that he had formed a rapid response team to work with industry , academia and government agencies to speed the manufacturing of antiviral drugs like tamiflu and the study of vaccines against bird flu dr von eschenbach also said the fda was on the lookout for counterfeit supplies of tamiflu , although he said none had been spotted so far he warned people against buying drugs from unlicensed pharmacies or web sites that had not been certified by the national association of boards of pharmacy
ramallah , west bank , july 23 with just 24 days to go before israel begins withdrawing from the gaza strip , american officials acknowledge that none of the major outstanding issues that all sides agree need to be settled so that gaza does not effectively become a prison for its 13 million residents have been resolved secretary of state condoleezza rice finished two days of mediation between israelis and palestinians on saturday evening , and officials traveling with her said they might have made incremental progress on some issues but no breakthroughs but , they asserted , that was all they had hoped for in addition , noted one senior official traveling with ms rice , this is a negotiation , and people do n't usually settle a negotiation weeks before the deadline that deadline is aug 17 , the day israeli settlers and soldiers are scheduled to begin leaving gaza palestinians , in their meetings on saturday with ms rice , complained about the state of affairs , saying none of their questions had been answered but in her meetings with the israeli prime minister , ariel sharon , and other israeli leaders , ms rice was told that israel s primary concern was the continuing palestinian attacks against israel at a news conference on saturday afternoon , ms rice praised mahmoud abbas , the palestinian president , for the steps he had taken to quell the violence and attacks from gaza but she noted the impasse on withdrawal arrangements and said gaza cannot be sealed or isolated after israel s withdrawal she added , however , that they are making some progress and that we can close many of these issues very expeditiously with enough will or perhaps a change of view from both sides but aides traveling with her said only two of the less important issues the fate of the gaza settlers' houses , and of their greenhouses are ripe for resolution , as one senior official put it the officials said the united states had identified six crucial issues that need to be resolved , those two and four others \( 6 \) palestinians and their goods need to be allowed to move in and out of gaza \( 6 \) a secure way needs to be found to allow palestinians in gaza to travel to the west bank , and vice versa \( 6 \) roadblocks and other travel restrictions in the west bank need to be reduced \( 6 \) a way needs to be found to open the gaza airport , and a seaport needs to be built all sides agree that building a seaport would take several years , even if a full accord on all the issues were reached now the airport could be reopened within a few months on july 12 , a palestinian suicide bomber killed himself and two israelis in netanya that set off almost 10 days of reprisals and counterattacks , during which the negotiations over the gaza withdrawal were canceled they resumed this week palestinian militants killed two israelis near the gaza border on sunday as ms rice left the region , reuters reported israeli troops gave chase after the ambush at the kissufim border crossing and killed two gunmen , the israeli army said while mr sharon told ms rice that the palestinians needed to improve security enforcement to prevent attacks , at the news conference with her on saturday afternoon , mr abbas criticized israel for airstrikes and other military actions that have taken numerous palestinian lives , saying they are partly to blame for the palestinian attacks it is inconceivable that israel will continue its repeated aggressions such as murders and invasions and siege and arrests and detentions that impede our efforts to bring back safety and calm to everyone , mr abbas said ms rice steered clear of this debate and placed at least equal weight on the israelis' security concerns before mentioning the palestinians' issues on saturday afternoon , she said , it is important that areas vacated by israel will not be used as a base for terrorist actions on the issue of gaza withdrawal , mr abbas was lowkey and diplomatic in his appearance with ms rice coordinating the israeli withdrawal from the outset is a vital thing , very vital , he said but in an interview with reuters on friday , he was more direct , saying we need information on how the disengagement will take place when , where will it begin , what is the fate of the border crossings , what is the fate of the palestinian airport \? we 're not getting any answers when a palestinian journalist asked about the many unresolved gaza withdrawal issues , ms rice said palestinians need questions answered from the israelis , and israelis need questions from the palestinians this is not a oneway street we are talking to both parties , she added that is why i am here a senior official traveling with ms rice noted that israel was awaiting answers from the palestinians on questions apart from the security concerns , including how customs enforcement would work at gaza s border with israel the palestinians' primary concern is that israel has not given them any assurance of movement of people and goods in and out of gaza , either into israel or south into egypt we have yet to receive one answer , one answer , on the question of freedom of movement , said diana buttu , a legal adviser to the palestinian authority officials with ms rice acknowledged the issue was important and as yet unresolved , but one added a number of solutions have been proposed that we think will work ms rice emphasized that the two sides would continue to talk i think everyone wants to clarify certain questions , she said , and i will work to help them when ms rice hastily scheduled this trip last week , canceling part of a longplanned visit to africa , violence from both sides was escalating , and israeli tanks were lined up at the gaza border at that time , an israeli official said , we hope we do n't have to go into gaza before her arrival since then , attacks and responses have diminished correction august 6 , 2005 , saturday an article on july 24 about major issues that remained unresolved as the date approached for israel s withdrawal from gaza misstated the number of israeli deaths in a suicide bombing in netanya on july 12 it was five , not two
the four democratic mayoral candidates aggressively courted voters yesterday on the eve of today s primary , with fernando ferrer making an appeal to black and hispanic new yorkers in hopes of winning the primary and avoiding a runoff , while the three others tried to energize their core supporters to vote in a race where turnout is the big unknown behind the scenes , meanwhile , there was 11thhour strategizing in the four camps as they prepared for victory and defeat today advisers to representative anthony d weiner , who in polls has been gaining ground on mr ferrer , were moving to use more volunteers in parts of brooklyn , where they believe he could come in first , and queens , where mr weiner s message of aiding the middle class has apparently been having success mr weiner s aides were also examining ways they might coax endorsements from the two other candidates , c virginia fields and gifford miller , in the case of a ferrerweiner runoff mr miller , the city council speaker , has dozens of major endorsements , including those of the brooklyn and queens democratic organizations , which mr weiner would also like to pick off quickly mr ferrer displayed his own political muscle yesterday during an earlymorning stop at the jamaica center subway station in queens , where he greeted riders along with the state attorney general , eliot spitzer city comptroller william c thompson and the rev al sharpton , who endorsed him on sunday after months of flirting with sitting out the primary despite mr ferrer s carefully calibrated message about representing all new yorkers , not only fellow members of minorities , mr sharpton was direct in his appeal to black and latino new yorkers we have to come out and win the primary and then have a candidate that can unite the party to compete with mr bloomberg , mr sharpton said you cannot have a coalition in the democratic party without the people of color in this city represented mr sharpton called for black voters to unite behind mr ferrer despite his controversial remark that the 1999 fatal police shooting of amadou diallo was not a crime all of us have blundered and made mistakes , mr sharpton said referring to the city s first black mayor , he added when dave dinkins ran , he made a mistake with the latino community we asked them to keep moving now mr ferrer has said to us that 'i said something careless ' mr sharpton also stepped up his criticism of mr weiner for voting in congress to authorize the war in iraq in response to mr weiner s statement that his vote was based on poor information due to president bush s lies , mr sharpton said he was more confident with who was not fooled many white voters have been wary of mr sharpton for years , especially his history of focusing on racial divisions in times of crisis mr weiner , who wants many of these white voters to back him today , was nevertheless emphatic that he would not exploit racial suspicions for the sake of votes i'm absolutely committed to the idea that i would rather lose this election than have any divisions come from it , mr weiner said after a small but energetic rally in carroll gardens , brooklyn we 're going to unify this party around an economic theme that says , all hardworking new yorkers are going to have a voice , and that voice is in the democratic party asked explicitly whether a ferrerweiner runoff would roil the electorate on racial lines , mr weiner s tone hardened notably no campaign 2005 will be marked by a unified democratic party , he said for his part , mr ferrer , who traveled from southeast queens to the west bronx to the tip end of manhattan , sounded hopeful that he might get enough votes to win the primary without a runoff , but had none of the uncharacteristic bravado he displayed toward the end of last week i'm hopeful that everyone who supports my candidacy can help push me there i know they can , he said two new polls yesterday showed mr ferrer capturing 32 to 35 percent of the vote today , while he needs 40 percent to avoid a runoff on sept 27 with the next highest votegetter mr weiner held second place solidly in both polls , with ms fields and mr miller well behind although mr ferrer has appeared to lack momentum in recent polls , something was visible during his stop yesterday at monroe college in the bronx , where mr ferrer reached as near a feverpitch as he had throughout the campaign what we 're fighting over is not a few votes or a few poll points we 're fighting over a vision of new york , mr ferrer told a cheering , screaming audience of students and faculty members the power to do that is in your hands , in your hands ! he yelled , holding his arms aloft as the crowd roared its approval ms fields made 12 campaign stops and radio interviews in about 12 hours yesterday , including a breakfast fundraiser where supporters played down the significance of polls showing her in third place , and of mr sharpton s call for black voters to support mr ferrer have any of you been polled \? percy e sutton , a former manhattan borough president , asked supporters yet ms fields also sounded like a candidate who was prepared for the voting to begin , come what may you ca n't pull that lever for them you just feel helpless , she said , adding , you walk around and you feel like hey , you know , you 've done it , and i believe that we have done it mr miller , meanwhile , made at least 10 stops during a long day that took him to all five boroughs , starting at 6 30 am by greeting commuters on the staten island ferry despite the opinion polls , mr miller remained resolutely upbeat in public yesterday in private , however , some of his advisers said discouragement was setting in , and that even their game plan for turning out voters was not enough to double mr miller s poll ratings and vault him into a runoff reggie johnson , a spokesman for mr miller , tried to sound as many notes of optimism as he could during an interview yesterday when pressed , mr miller said it was not time to give up you never know until people vote , mr miller said it s discouraging to see the polls where they are but we 're still holding out hope
the inkjet printer an industry barely alive gentlemen , we can rebuild it we have the technology we can make it better than it was before better , cheaper , faster \( music swells \) no , it s not the old six million dollar man tv show it s the 14 billion dollar printer that s how much money hewlettpackard spent , over five years , designing a new inkjet printing system that it says will change the industry the company claims that the first machine with this technology , the hp photosmart 8250 , is the world s fastest photo printer , capable of printing 32 pages of text a minute and spitting out a shiny fourbysixinch print in 14 seconds it would be a big deal if the machine could actually achieve that kind of speed after all , there are cheaper ways to turn your digital shots into prints , like taking your memory card to a walmart \( 15 cents for a fourbysixinch print \) or ordering them online \( 19 cents each through apple s service \) prints from the 8250 average 24 cents in ink and paper but your time is worth something , too instant gratification , without having to drive somewhere or wait for the mail , is surely worth a few extra cents you can tell just by looking that the 8250 , arriving on store shelves this week , is not one of those 3999 plastic models that scream , i'm cheap , but i 'll get you on the cartridges the printer costs 200 it s heavy , built like an armored humvee there s a lot of tech in there for example , the machine can print directly from your camera s memory card no computer needed the front panel accommodates compact flash , sd , xd and memory stick formats of course , if you 're going to make prints right off the memory card \( or right off the camera , connected by a usb cable \) , you 'll need some way to choose the pictures so the printer also has a 25inch color screen with previous , next and select photo buttons the wellwritten messages on this screen also serve as the printer s communications channel with you , its proud owner the 8250 works well as a traditional printer for printing pictures from programs like picasa 2 \( for windows \) and iphoto \( for the mac \) it can hold lettersize and fourbysix photo paper at the same time as a bonus , the printer even doubles as a card reader memory cards in the printer act like miniature disk drives none of this , however , is new plenty of other printers can do all this the 8250 s advances have to do with how it performs these tasks for starters , there s its speed now , hp s marketing department may have been reaching a tad with that 14 seconds per print business you get that speed only in draft mode , from a computer \( not the memory card \) , on prints with white borders edgetoedge printing always takes longer that time measurement does n't count the seven seconds of thinking the printer does after you hit the print button , either even so , the 8250 can deliver a finished borderless fourbysix photo in less than 25 seconds that s still about half or even a third of the time of other photo printers hp says that its speed comes from two clever tricks first , the actual print head , several inches away from the tanks , has tiny ink reservoirs of its own it can start squirting ink right away , rather than having to prime itself for a few seconds by wicking ink in from the tanks second , the print head paints a huge swath of the page over half an inch tall , with 3 , 900 tiny ink jets firing on each pass the second big advance is a new set of inkconservation strategies if hp s use of the phrase ink conservation made you splurt your coffee , then you 've obviously had some experience with inkjet printers everybody knows that the printer companies make most of their money selling cartridges , not printers for hp to claim breakthroughs in saving ink is like a fox declaring that it s thought up some new ways to guard the henhouse it s true , though , that you can replace the 8250 s six color cartridges individually , so you do n't wind up throwing away unused colors when one tank runs dry \( each cartridge costs 10 and is good for 170 to 350 photos , depending on color the doublesize black tank sells for 18 and lasts for 650 photos \) but this printer also analyzes the data of each page it s about to print and if there s not enough ink of a certain color , a message warns you before it begins to print \( other printers often make that discovery halfway through a page , wasting paper and ink \) furthermore , the company says that when purging the tiny air bubbles that inevitably form in the printing plumbing , the 8250 reclaims the ink , rather than wastefully spraying it into a piece of foam rubber , as other printers do the cartridges , unusually shaped like threedimensional t s , are very easy to unwrap and install and to make installation idiotproof , they 're identified by shape logos square , diamond , and so on for each cartridge instead of by mysterious color names or abbreviations \( what the heck is photo cyan , anyway \? \) finally , the 8250 is the first printer that can exploit a new line of photo paper called hp advanced photo paper \( which , alas , will inevitably be confused with hp advanced , a plainpaper line \) the back of each sheet bears small bar codes , in silver paint , at diagonally opposite corners by scanning that bar code , the 8250 learns what kind of paper you 've inserted and what size , so you do n't have to change any software settings yourself \( it also notices when you 've inserted the paper wrong side up , refusing to waste paper and ink by spraying inky globs on the back of the paper \) oddly , though , the advanced photo paper is n't actually hp s best photo paper inkjet paper can be formulated to dry quickly or to last for years , but not both the advanced photo paper is intended to dry extremely quickly a necessity in the world s fastest photo printer but its prints can begin to fade in as little as a year \( 50 years if kept under glass or in an album \) your alternative is hp premium plus photo paper , which is rated to last at least 90 years , even exposed to air premium plus prints also look a lot better , with superior blacks , detail and color trouble is , premium plus paper takes a lot longer to print about 80 seconds for a fourbysix photo it s kind of a shame to invest in the world s fastest printer and then wind up waiting 80 seconds for a print whenever you want anything more permanent than what the company calls refrigerator pictures that s not the only quirk of the new printer each time you hit the select photo button \( to choose a picture to print from a memory card \) , a little check mark appears on the screen but when you press the next button , the check mark briefly disappears before the next photo scrolls into view wait did you just uncheck it \? no , it s just a software glitch welllighted photos and outdoor shots look bright , crisp and vivid , even on advanced photo paper but many of my indoor shots taken without the flash emerged with an unfortunate orange cast it was so severe on some shots , i was convinced something was wrong with the printer \( the same photos printed on a canon inkjet had lower contrast , but at least they were n't orange \) still , over all , hewlettpackard s enormous investment has paid off that s fortunate , because the company will soon release several other new machines based on these technologies no , the 8250 is not the bionic printer but you 'd be hard pressed to find an easiertouse printer or a more versatile one and , at least for everyday fridge prints , you wo n't find a faster one circuits email pogue nytimescom
london , march 6 in the catholic neighborhoods of belfast , the irish republican army has long served as judge , jury and , in some cases , executioner , meting out its own brand of vigilante justice catholics who defy the ira s dictates end up with broken kneecaps those who betray the ira wind up dead but now five sisters are turning that tradition upside down , spurred by the extraordinarily brutal killing on jan 30 of their brother , robert mccartney , and what is widely seen as a subsequent ira coverup mr mccartney was attacked in a crowded belfast bar , then taken outside and beaten with iron pipes his throat was slit and his torso was slashed open with a knife the attackers left him to bleed while they went back to the bar , scrubbed it of evidence and warned customers that the fight had been an internal ira matter so far , the witnesses have heeded the warning from the ira men , and none have come forward to the police the mccartney sisters , working on instinct and grief , are demanding that the ira stop protecting the attackers as many as 15 men , whose identities are widely known and allow witnesses to tell the police their stories so that justice can be done the sisters' boldness has galvanized the community for perhaps the first time , the ira is facing broad and vocal dissent among its own supporters the killing and the sisters' response are creating a crisis for sinn fein , the ira s political party , as well as for the ira s rank and file and its leadership , coming as it does just weeks after the group was weakened by accusations that it was behind a belfast bank robbery that netted 50 million the events have added to a disillusionment with the ira that has slowly built since the 1998 peace accords its members , once considered heroes in catholic neighborhoods for their role in the struggle against british rule , are increasingly seen as turning to mafialike crime and common thuggery and preying on the very community that formed the group s core of support the ira , long nicknamed ra , is now sometimes called the rafia the firestorm over mr mccartney s killing has forced the ira and sinn fein into a corner , people in belfast say and pressure is building from longtime backers in ireland and the united states to some , the furor threatens to strip away the old veneer of constructive ambiguity that allowed the ira and sinn fein to claim that their leaders had no true ties on thursday , one day before the start of sinn fein s annual political conference , gerry adams , the party leader , announced that he had suspended seven party members over accusations that they were involved in the killing a week earlier , the ira announced that it had expelled three men it believed were involved startlingly , mr adams also said he had given the names of the seven men to a police ombudsman the ira and sinn fein had always refused relations with the police service , out of deep suspicion from the time of the troubles , as the civil strife is known and on saturday , at a party conference in dublin , mr adams , appearing with the mccartney sisters , ratcheted up the pressure and urged the men to come forward those responsible for the brutal killing of robert mccartney should admit to what they did in a court of law , mr adams said i am not letting this issue go until those who have sullied the name of the republican cause are made to account for their actions the irish government of prime minister bertie ahern , which had strongly supported mr adams through the peace effort , has now publicly challenged mr adams to admit that he is a member of the ira leadership and has said that the top leadership of sinn fein must have known about the belfast robbery and probably approved it sinn fein has also lost whatever good will it had mustered with prime minister tony blair of britain , a sponsor of the peace effort , as well as some of its backing from irish in the united states mr adams has canceled fundraising efforts in the united states , and his deputy , martin mcguinness , will not travel to the united states this month as expected for its part , the white house canceled this year s st patrick s day invitations to the leaders of northern ireland s political parties to avoid the embarrassment of having sinn fein represented instead , the mccartney sisters are planning a trip to the united states for st patrick s day , possibly to new york and washington the sisters have bluntly pressed for justice all of ireland knows who the men are , catherine mccartney , 36 , a teacher , said of the attackers in an interview last week inside her sister paula s home in belfast but people know what the ira are capable of they butchered a man and slit his throat i would be afraid , too republicanism is not what happened to robert , she said they ca n't call themselves republican if they did that certainly not murdering innocent people many catholics in the mccartneys' neighborhood , a battlescarred area called the short strand , have responded with surprising solidarity on the day of the funeral for mr mccartney , a popular 33yearold fork lift operator with two young sons , a thousand people turned up graffiti denouncing the ira popped up on walls , a first in a republican neighborhood the markings were quickly erased , but quickly reappeared small photocopied posters with mr mccartney s photograph appeared on shop windows no more lies , one said shame on them , said another last sunday , the women held a rally in the neighborhood hundreds showed up , including politicians , and several speakers expressed outrage the sisters held placards that read , murdered who s next \? if these men walk free from this , then everyone in ireland should fear the consequences , paula mccartney , 40 , a queen s university student , told the crowd , according to news reports justice must be done the police said friday that 10 people had been arrested so far but had refused to cooperate and were released we need witnesses , and those witnesses need to be able to return to their own communities , said the northern ireland police detective superintendent , george hamilton the plea was indicative of the more troubled relationship that has developed between the ira and catholics in belfast s nationalist area since the troubles wound down after the 1998 good friday peace agreement many people interviewed here say they feel indebted to the ira , a private army , for fighting for catholic rights and protecting them from protestant loyalists , like the shankill butchers , who tortured and killed catholics with butchers' knives they acknowledge being increasingly disturbed by the ira s criminal undertakings , acts of intimidation and extortion , and punishment beatings once mostly excused as necessary tools of war during the troubles , such acts are now far harder to accept there is a cynicism within the community , said anthony mcintyre , who served 18 years in prison for ira activity and is now a dissident one reason the ira existed was to protect people from the shankill butchers now ira members are plowing their violence in their own community everyone knows what happened on jan 30 witnesses have talked on the street , and people have told these stories to the sisters mr mccartney stopped for a drink with a friend at magennis s bar in the markets section of belfast on that sunday night an ira man thought he saw mr mccartney make a rude gesture toward a woman in his own group in the crowded bar a brawl broke out , then spilled into the streets a short while later , mr mccartney lay dying his friend s throat was sliced , as well , but he survived the attackers walked a couple of blocks back to the bar , locked it and warned the 70 people inside to keep quiet , the sisters added this is ira business , the sisters were told the men said the men wiped down the bar , washing away fingerprints and blood the next day some of them were seen in the neighborhood , chatting with friends on street corners , as if jan 30 had been no different from jan 29 , the sisters said the message was plain they can murder you , clean it up , cover it up and walk away , catherine mccartney said
it is now up to the giants and the jets whether there will be a new stadium complex in the meadowlands the board of the new jersey sports and exposition authority voted yesterday to give the giants a 10day extension , until sept 29 , to work out their differences with the jets over the ground rules and design of the complex , and to form a 5050 partnership to operate a new football stadium if a deal cannot be reached , the sports authority will end an april agreement signed by the state and the giants to build a vast stadium complex on 75 acres of public land in the meadowlands the two teams have divergent views on the size and shape of the stadium , the location of a practice field and certain retail operations , as well as the stadium s relationship to xanadu , the 2 billion retail and entertainment complex that would share the property but while none of the issues appear insurmountable , a deal with the jets would require a fundamental change in the giants' position as the preeminent tenant at the sports complex no longer would the jets have to play in a stadium emblazoned with the electric blue letters of another team the jets , in turn , would have to give up any plans , real or otherwise , of moving to queens it must be a real , genuine 5050 partnership , said carl goldberg , chairman of the sports authority i do n't think the differences are so significant as to preclude a meeting of the minds but the jockeying for position continued , with the jets trying to maintain maximum leverage we remain concerned that the stadium proposal developed by the giants does not address such fundamental areas of concern as stadium configuration and business terms , the jets said in a statement late yesterday afternoon we will continue to work toward resolution of these issues , but it is unreasonable to expect such a complex agreement could be concluded in just 10 days in the meantime , the jets said they would continue to explore their options , including a new football and soccer stadium in queens the vote to extend the deadline came after weeks of public sparring by the sports authority , the giants , the jets and the developers of xanadu with the april agreement on the verge of collapse , the giants finally submitted their master plan on thursday for an 80 , 000seat , twoteam stadium , a training operation and a sportsoriented retail center , which was required by the april agreement a second condition set by the state , for the giants to come to terms with xanadu , was cleared 15 minutes before the authority s board met yesterday and another deadline expired the giants struck a definitive agreement with xanadu s developers , acknowledging , at least for now , that the retail center would not interfere with gameday operations this was obviously a huge hurdle , said john k mara , the giants' chief operating officer we 're relieved to have it behind us we 're now onto the next step , reaching an agreement with the jets the developers agreed to give the giants 15 million , a part of which would go to the jets , to offset any gameday disruptions caused by construction activity but they declined to back the giants' master plan , saying that stadium details have to be worked out between the two teams the developers gave the giants the right to sue them up to two years after the new stadium opens if xanadu results in extra traffic congestion or interferes with tailgating fans while the giants had largely ignored xanadu in the past , their master plan now shows a bridge to the retail and entertainment complex over route 120 and a soontobebuilt rail station after sharply criticizing the quality of the giants' plans and bargaining posture , mr goldberg went out of this way yesterday to praise the work done by mr mara over the past 48 hours we are genuinely pleased by the progress made by the football giants , mr goldberg said in an interview yesterday , mr mara said that the giants and jets should form an equal partnership at the end of the day , both us will realize that this deal makes so much sense , he said it s in both our interests to consummate something as quickly as possible but last month , the giants displayed preliminary stadium plans that had the giants logo splashed across it , but neglected to name the presumed coowner the omission was regarded by the jets as a snub mr mara said yesterday that it was a misunderstanding still , the jets are not eager to put everything behind one option after their bruising , fiveyear , 65 million effort to build a stadium in manhattan ended in failure the team has pursued two options , one in new jersey and one in queens but the effort to quickly forge a deal in new jersey would undercut queens , which requires a lengthy state approval process to turn over the public parkland the team wants to a private user despite talk of queens , mr goldberg said yesterday that based on his conversations with l jay cross , the jets' president , he thought the team was truly committed to being in new jersey their focus and resources are exclusively on a football stadium at the sports complex , he said if the teams are able to agree , some of the money for a new stadium could come from the national football league , which provides teams with up to 150 million for construction with two teams involved , mr mara said , there s a strong argument that could be made that we 're entitled to more than 150 million , and maybe as much as 300 million
tama , sudan so who killed 2yearold zahra abdullah for belonging to the fur tribe \? at one level , the answer is simple the murderers were members of the janjaweed militia that stormed into this mudbrick village in the south darfur region at dawn four weeks ago on horses , camels and trucks zahra s mother , fatima omar adam , woke to gunfire and smoke and knew at once what was happening she jumped up from her sleeping mat and put zahra on her back , then grabbed the hands of her two older children and raced out of her thatchroof hut with her husband some of the marauders were right outside they yanked zahra from ms fatima s back and began bludgeoning her on the ground in front of her shrieking mother and sister then the men began beating ms fatima and the other two children , so she grabbed them and fled and the men returned to beating the life out of zahra at another level , responsibility belongs to the sudanese government , which armed the janjaweed and gave them license to slaughter and rape members of several african tribes , including the fur then some responsibility attaches to the rebels in darfur they claim to be representing the tribes being ethnically cleansed , but they have been fighting each other instead of negotiating a peace with the government that would end the bloodbath and finally , responsibility belongs to the international community to you and me for acquiescing in yet another genocide tama is just the latest of many hundreds of villages that have been methodically destroyed in the killing fields of darfur over the last two years ms fatima sat on the ground and told me her story which was confirmed by other eyewitnesses in a dull , choked monotone , as she described her guilt at leaving her child to die zahra was on the ground , and they were beating her with sticks , but i ran away , she said her 4yearold son , adam , was also beaten badly but survived a 9yearold daughter , khadija , has only minor injuries but she told me that she had constant nightmares about the janjaweed at least ms fatima knows what happened to her daughter a neighbor , aisha yagoub abdurahman , is beside herself because she says she saw her 10yearold son adil carried off by the janjaweed he is still missing , and everyone knows that the janjaweed regularly enslave children like him , using them as servants or sexual playthings in all , 37 people were killed in tama , and another 12 are missing the survivors fled five miles to another village that had been abandoned after being attacked by the janjaweed a year earlier now the survivors are terrified , and they surrounded me to ask for advice about how to stay alive none of them dared accompany me back to tama , which is an eerie ghost town , doors hanging off hinges and pots and sandals strewn about the only inhabitants i saw in tama were camels , which are now using the village as a pasture and which the villagers say belong to the janjaweed on the road back , i saw a group of six janjaweed , one displaying his rifle darfur is just the latest chapter in a sorry history of repeated inaction in the face of genocide , from that of armenians , through the holocaust , to the slaughter of cambodians , bosnians and rwandans if we had acted more resolutely last year , then zahra would probably still be alive attacks on villages like tama occur regularly over the last week , one tribe called the falata , backed and armed by the sudanese government , has burned villages belonging to the masalit tribe south of here dozens of bodies are said to be lying unclaimed on the ground president bush , where are you \? you emphasize your willingness to speak bluntly about evil , but you barely let the word darfur pass your lips the central lesson of the history of genocide is that the essential starting point of any response is to bellow moral outrage but instead , mr president , you 're whispering in a later column , i 'll talk more specifically about actions we should take , and it s true that this is a complex mess without easy solutions but for starters we need a dose of moral clarity for all the myriad complexities of darfur , what history will remember is that this is where little girls were bashed to death in front of their parents because of their tribe and because the world could n't be bothered to notice
to judge from its tense dave , a 55minute dancetheater piece that settled in to the dance theater workshop on wednesday night for a threeweek run , the chunky move company represents a kind of melbourne offshoot of the physical theater experiments popular in london the piece has three parents gideon obarzanek , who founded the australian company in 1995 and remains its artistic director lucy guerin , a choreographer and michael kantor , a theater director mr obarzanek invited the others to help him create semiimprovised character sketches and scenes the three worked together and separately with the performers , and eventually decided that their efforts could be combined within a single loose scenario from the staging standpoint , the central device is a nearly constantly revolving circular stage , spinning at different speeds and divided by moving panels that sometimes form piepieceshaped rooms , sometimes walls or chambers on an otherwise bare space the idea is to provide a cinematic fluidity that fixed stages inevitably lack the revolving stage itself is a handsome , oneton wooden structure , rather like the deck of a sailing ship it creaks , and there is usually an accompanying electronic rumble that further heightens the otherwise irrelevant maritime aura the scenario involves our erstwhile hero , dave , played by the tall , gawky , constantly bemused brian lucas , and a quartet who give him every reason to be tense there is a delusional woman in a victorian gown , fantasizing about period bodicerippers a suicidal woman in a white nightie a prim and proper shoe fetishist and a sullen punk sometimes the characters talk , and sometimes there is a recorded verbal overlay everyone \( except dave \) shifts personalities in the course of the piece for example , at one point three of them engage in a macabre bit as murderous robots , mechanically dismembering one of their number with loud whirring and drill and chainsawlike sounds , the scene recalls the work of the american composer and performance artist john moran , and is highly effective in itself but where it fits into the scenario , other than as a generic nightmare , would be hard to say at the end , the clockwise revolving stops and all is still the silence is dramatic in itself then it starts up again , counterclockwise dave picks himself up from his dreamy swoon and begins to walk , semipurposefully , a nottootelling metaphor for carrying on with his life the other performers kristy ayre , michelle heaven , brian carbee and luke smiles do all that is asked of them , although none have quite the personal vividness of mr lucas the whole thing is carried off with impressive technical skill but the aesthetic and emotional payoff is less than the sum of its often arresting parts tense dave continues through june 11 at dance theater workshop , 219 west 19th street , \( 212 \) 9240077
colorado springs there were personal testimonies about jesus from the stage , a comedian quoting scripture and a fivepiece band performing contemporary christian praise songs then hundreds of air force chaplains stood and sang , many with palms upturned , in a service with a distinctively evangelical tone it was the opening ceremony of a fourday spiritual fitness conference at a hilton hotel here last month organized and paid for by the air force for many of its united statesbased chaplains and their families , at a cost of 300 , 000 the chaplains , who pledge when they enter the military to minister to everyone , methodist , mormon or muslim , attended workshops on the purpose driven life , the best seller by the megachurch pastor rick warren , and on how to improve their worship services in the hotel hallways , vendors from focus on the family and other evangelical organizations promoted materials for the chaplains to use in their work the event was just one indication of the extent to which evangelical christians have become a growing force in the air force chaplain corps , a trend documented by military records and interviews with more than two dozen chaplains and other military officials figures provided by the air force show that from 1994 to 2005 the number of chaplains from many evangelical and pentecostal churches rose , some doubling for example , chaplains from the full gospel fellowship of churches and ministries international increased to 10 from none the church of the nazarene rose to 12 from 6 at the same time , the number of chaplains from the roman catholic church declined to 94 from 167 , and there were declines in more liberal , mainline protestant churches the united church of christ to 3 from 11 , the united methodist church to 50 from 64 other branches of the military did not make available similar statistics , but officials say they are seeing the same trend the change mirrors the air force as a whole , where representation is rising from evangelical churches but there are also increasing numbers of enlistees from minority religions as well as atheists it has all created a complicated environment and caused tensions over tolerance and the role of the military chaplain some conflicts have already become public a pentagon investigation into the religious climate at the air force academy here found no overt discrimination , but it did find that officers and faculty members periodically used their positions to promote their christian beliefs and failed to accommodate nonchristian cadets , for example refusing them time off for religious holidays other conflicts have remained out of the public eye , like the 50 evangelical chaplains who have filed a class action suit against the navy charging they were dismissed or denied promotions one of the chaplains said that once while leading an evangelical style service at a base in okinawa he was interrupted by an episcopal chaplain who announced he was stepping in to lead a proper christian worship service there is also a former marine who said that about half of the eight chaplains he came into contact with in his military career tried to convince him to abandon his mormon faith , telling him it was wicked or satanic a complex religious environment part of the struggle , chaplains and officials say , is the result of growing diversity but part is from evangelicals following their church s teachings to make converts while serving in a military job where they are supposed to serve the spiritual needs of soldiers , fliers and sailors of every faith evangelical chaplains say they walk a fine line brig gen cecil r richardson , the air force deputy chief of chaplains , said in an interview , we will not proselytize , but we reserve the right to evangelize the unchurched the distinction , he said , is that proselytizing is trying to convert someone in an aggressive way , while evangelizing is more gently sharing the gospel certainly , the religious environment encountered by the chaplains is complex statistics on enlistees provided by the air force show there are now about 3 , 500 who say they are either hindus , buddhists , muslims , pagans , druids or shamans there are 1 , 600 who say they are atheists and about 50 , 000 who say they have no religious preference , out of a total of 280 , 000 roman catholics number about 60 , 000 there are also growing numbers of enlistees from evangelical churches in 2005 , there were 1 , 794 members of the assemblies of god in the air force , 597 from the church of the nazarene and 108 from the christian and missionary alliance because so many churches cannot be comfortably categorized as evangelical or nonevangelical , and because so many enlistees identify themselves simply as christian , it is difficult to ascertain cumulative numbers military officials say the government is not promoting the change in the chaplain corps instead religious leaders who recruit for the military attribute it to factors including the general shortage of catholic priests , the liberal denominations' discomfort with military interventions abroad , the do n't ask , do n't tell policy on gay men and lesbians , and evangelicals' broad support for the military the military is trying to grapple with the fallout gen john p jumper , the air force chief of staff , sent a personal message to commanders on june 28 , warning them against promoting their religious beliefs , saying , the expression of personal preferences to subordinates , especially in a professional setting or at mandatory events , is inappropriate 'we are not generic chaplains' our chaplains , general jumper wrote , should set the example for mutual respect among different faiths and beliefs air force officials contend that the spiritual fitness conference was not evangelical , pointing to the participation of a catholic band leader and a mormon expert on families there was also an interfaith worship service in which all the chaplains planned to recite a hebrew prayer together they said that 10 jewish chaplains stayed in the same hotel and were bused to the air force academy for a separate program each day we are not generic chaplains , said col bob v page , who helped organize the conference we say , 'cooperation without compromise' i cannot compromise my faith chaplains are the often unsung members of the clergy who pray , counsel and go to war alongside american troops whatever their church or creed , when they join the military they pledge to serve the spiritual needs of every faith the military recruits chaplains through endorsing agents who work for about 100 different churches or religious denominations the agents select potential candidates and refer them to the military , a system created to avoid the constitutional problem of government endorsement of religion in the air force , chaplain candidates must be under 40 and have a college degree they must also have several years of ministry experience and be able to pass a physical fitness test they also must attend an air force training program for chaplains the churches that once supplied most of the chaplains say they are now having trouble recruiting for a variety of reasons many members of their clergy are now women , who are less likely to seek positions as military chaplains or who entered the ministry as a second career and are too old to qualify the catholic church often does not have enough priests to serve its parishes , let alone send them to the military there are also political reasons anne c loveland , a retired professor of american history at louisiana state university and the author of american evangelicals and the us military , 19421993 , said the foundation for the change in the chaplaincy was laid during the vietnam war evangelical denominations were very supportive of the war , and mainline liberal denominations were very much against it , ms loveland said that cemented this growing relationship between the military and the evangelicals chaplain edward t brogan , director of the presbyterian council for chaplains and military personnel , who recruits and recommends chaplain candidates for several presbyterian churches , calls the change a supply and demand issue i regularly am contacted by military recruiters who would like to have more presbyterians because they need baby baptizers , he said many evangelical ministers , according to their tradition , only baptize older children or adults the presbyterian church usa , a more liberal denomination , has had a 10year drop in its air force chaplains from 30 in 1994 to 16 in 2005 for the same period , the presbyterian church in america , which is more conservative , has increased the numbers of its air force chaplains to 15 from 4 the air force had a total of 611 chaplains at the start of 2005 though chaplain brogan has had problems finding chaplains to meet demands of the military , the rev maurice j hart , the endorsing agent for the full gospel fellowship of churches and ministers international , an evangelical church based in irving , tex , has not it s been easy , mr hart said they realize the men are really stressed out and in danger and harm s way , and they just feel like , 'that s my calling i 'd like to go and be a blessing ' in 1994 , the full gospel fellowship had no air force chaplains , but by 2005 it had 10 \( and that with only 58 members on the air force rolls at that time \) the number is impressive because many of the 100 denominations supply only a handful of chaplains each the evangelical chaplains are changing the concept of ministry in the military , said kristen j leslie , an assistant professor of pastoral care and counseling at yale divinity school , who has observed chaplains at the air force academy evangelicals administer biblecentered care in which the notion is that the religious message is core , and you bring everybody to it and that s how you create healing , ms leslie said if someone is struggling with a supervisor , a spouse or depression , an evangelical chaplain urges them to turn their life over to christ and look for answers in the scriptures , she said that is fine for a church setting , ms leslie said , but what is required in a diverse religious environment like the military is the pastoral care approach you walk with the person in the midst of their brokenness , using the resources of their faith to help heal them a push for inclusiveness still , many evangelical chaplains say they understand the distinct nature of their work for the military , recounting in interviews that they have helped arrange seders , the ritual passover supper , for jewish sailors or solstice celebrations for wiccan marines general richardson , the deputy chief of chaplains , said that although his faith required him to evangelize , he would help accommodate the faiths of others i am an assemblies of god , poundthepulpit preacher , but i 'll go to the ropes for the wiccan , he said , if that group wanted permission to celebrate a religious ritual in the navy some evangelical chaplains say they are the ones discriminated against chaplain gordon james klingenschmitt , of the evangelical episcopal church , says he was warned by commanders that his approach to the ministry was not inclusive enough when a catholic sailor on his ship died , lieutenant klingenschmitt said he preached at a memorial service and emphasized that for those who did not accept jesus , god s wrath remains upon him after that and several other incidents , lieutenant klingenschmitt s commanding officer recommended that the navy not renew his chaplain contract the lieutenant is fighting to remain in the military the navy wants to impose its religion on me , he said religious pluralism is a religion it s a theology all by itself lt cmdr david s wilder , a 20year navy chaplain who is a plaintiff in the class action suit against the navy , said that his troubles began on okinawa after the more senior episcopal chaplain stepped in and interrupted his worship service he says that that chaplain has blocked his promotion there s a pecking order in the navy chaplain corps , commander wilder said , and at the very top is the roman catholics and just below them are the episcopals and lutherans and if you 're an evangelical nonliturgical christian of some type you 're down on the bottom a navy spokeswoman said that many of the chaplains in the class action lawsuit were not promoted for reasons other than religious discrimination for the mormon in the marine corps , interactions with chaplains made him decide to become one himself a 29yearold who left the service in the late 1990 s , he is now applying to become a military chaplain with the intent , he said , of providing the troops a more inclusive form of pastoring he insisted on anonymity so as not to undermine his application he said that his faith was frequently denigrated by fellow marines , and even by some of his commanders what compounded it was when the chaplains would agree with them , he said that s what makes me want to become a military chaplain not just that my faith and other minority faiths were underrepresented , but to make it a more spiritually accepting environment
rupert murdoch s oldest son , lachlan considered by many to be his heir apparent resigned yesterday from his job at the news corporation amid apparent family discord , adding a new twist to one of the business world s most closely watched succession chronicles the decision by lachlan , 33 , to step down leaves just one of rupert murdoch s four adult children , james , in an executive position at the company , making him the clear frontrunner to one day succeed his father james , 32 , runs british sky broadcasting , the satellite television service that is 34 percent owned by the news corporation rupert murdoch , 74 , the chairman and chief executive of the news corporation , has made clear that he would like one of his children to succeed him the reasons lachlan gave for his exit were his yearning for australia , where he spent six years helping to oversee operations of the news corporation there , and a desire to spend more time with his wife and infant son but the abruptness of his departure suggested a palace intrigue of the kind that some of the news corporation s media holdings like the sun in london or the new york post newspapers or the fox news channel would follow with great relish more than just about any business scion , lachlan with his tattooed forearm and model wife sarah o'hare is something of a global celebrity lachlan is said by several former colleagues , none of whom would be quoted for fear of reprisal , to have chafed under what he saw as his father s overinvolvement in the running of the businesses those included the company s united states and australian print operations and local tv stations , and the new york post newspaper , where he was publisher the father and son , who have not been shy about displaying their affection for each other publicly with hugs and kisses , have not been as close of late , a person who works closely with both men said despite his official title as deputy chief operating officer , lachlan did not work closely with peter chernin , the news corporation s president and chief operating officer , and the two men had clashed in the past neither rupert nor lachlan murdoch , nor other news corporation officials , would discuss the fatherson spat that led to the departure , though two people close to lachlan said he had seriously considered leaving the company last summer , and perhaps earlier in all , lachlan worked at the media company for 11 years for the last 4 1 2 years he served as its deputy chief operating officer , based at the news corporation headquarters in new york i am particularly saddened by my son s decision and thank him for his terrific contribution to the company , rupert murdoch said in a press release i have respected the professionalism and integrity that he has exhibited throughout his career at news corporation in an email message lachlan sent to the news corporation employees yesterday afternoon , he called his resignation a very difficult decision that was made only after long and hard deliberations over many months lachlan has told people he does not rule out returning to the news corporation as an executive someday , leaving him in contention to one day succeed his father and he will remain on the news corporation board as the representative of the murdoch family trust , which owns a 285 percent voting interest in the company he also will serve as an adviser to the company the company includes such businesses as the times newspaper in london , the book publisher harpercollins , the satellite service directv and the 20th century fox film studio gary ginsberg , a news corporation spokesman , said lachlan s resignation does not mean his brother james had been given the nod it does not change the succession plan at all , mr ginsberg said rupert has said he plans on staying as chairman as long as he is mentally and physically fit to do so in the nearterm , rupert murdoch has said mr chernin is likely to be his successor as chief executive , but his ambition is for a member of his family to one day take the top job mr chernin recently extended his contract for five years previously , rupert murdoch had hinted he envisioned his sons collaborating on running the company in a statement , lachlan said , i would like especially to thank my father for all he has taught me in business and in life in the quarter ended march 31 , the news corporation reported earnings of 400 million on sales of 6 billion , compared with earnings of 434 million on sales of 52 billion wall street s reaction to the news was muted , with shares of news corporation down 23 cents , to 1734 yesterday merrill lynch media analyst jessica reif cohen said that with lachlan s departure she believes james becomes the heirapparent to his father s empire however , this remains a very longterm issue , as we continue to expect mr chernin will take the helm of the company when rupert murdoch retires lachlan murdoch was raised in the united states but spent six years working at , and eventually running , the australian businesses in the 1990 s his record in that country , where he was chairman of its newspaper operations , was blemished by a 475 million \( australian \) investment in onetel , a telecom company that collapsed in 2000 in deciding to pursue what he called the next phase of my career in australia , lachlan follows a path similar to that of his sister , elisabeth , 36 , who spent several years at bskyb she also was seen as a potential successor until she resigned from the company in 2000 after tussling with her father she subsequently formed a television company in britain like lachlan , she could play a greater role when their father retires in a 2001 interview with an australian magazine , mr murdoch s exwife , anna the mother of elisabeth , lachlan and james warned that the pressures of seeing who would succeed rupert would lead to a lot of heartbreak and hardship for their children there s been such a lot of pressure that they need n't have had at their age family dynamics have changed even more since then , with mr murdoch s remarriage to wendi deng , a former executive at the news corporation s startv arm , and the addition of their two young children , grace and chloe , to the clan in all , there are six murdoch children ranging in age from 46 to 2 prudence , from mr murdoch s first marriage , is the eldest lachlan s departure focuses more attention on james , a harvard dropout who moved slightly out from under his father s wing last summer when he was hired as bskyb s chief executive while lachlan is more pensive and shares his father s affinity for the print newspaper business , which is the company s roots , james is more cerebral and technologyfocused james enjoys more autonomy than other news corporation division heads in part because bskyb is a separately traded public company to emphasize his independence , he resigned from the board of news corporation board over his father s objections like his younger brother and other scions at publicly listed companies , lachlan faced an uphill battle showing investors that his position was based on more than genetics as deputy chief operating officer , lachlan was paid 38 million in salary and bonus last year news corporation documents show him as the holder of 17 million shares of his own beyond the family s interests , which are held by an entity called the ae harris trust the trust s stake in the news corporation is currently valued at 61 billion lachlan played a visible role last year in convincing australian institutions to support the company s recent reincorporation as a united states company despite frequent international trips , his highestprofile position was as publisher of the feisty new york post in that position , lachlan relished the fight to overtake its rival , the new york daily news the post has increased its circulation significantly against its rival , although news corporation executives who said they could not be quoted because they were ordered not to speak about the matter , said the paper s losses under lachlan hit as much as 70 million a year in the statement , rupert murdoch praised lachlan for driving all of his reporting divisions to record profits and the new york post to its highestever circulation the paper did not name a replacement as publisher lachlan and sarah murdoch recently sold their home overlooking sydney s harbor and purchased a new home near the city s bondi beach area they will live there with their son , kalan , who was born last november it is unclear whether they 'll keep the fivestory building in new york s soho district that the murdochs purchased and are in the midst of renovating to transform into a singlefamily residence lachlan s departure also comes amid what appear to be cooling tensions between his father and john malone , the media financier who has amassed an 18 percent voting stake in the news corporation mr malone had acquired the stake last year to put pressure on rupert to trade some news corporation assets for the stock but mr malone s move also raised the question of whether the news corporation is vulnerable to takeover in recent weeks , people close to both camps have said they are exploring a new , friendly deal by which rupert murdoch might gain a proxy to vote mr malone s shares , or an agreement that mr malone would not buy any more shares if either comes to fruition , the murdoch family s control over the news corporation would be secure for now
a few days ago i was sitting by myself at the movies , soaking up hollywood dreams turned into light , when a collegeage man came over and sat down next to me you 're a producer , are n't you \? he asked how can i get my movie made \? i hear this question all the time at dinners , meetings or restaurants from waiters , friends and the children of friends and most often , from people i have never met before these days , i tell them , the challenge is n't getting your movie made practically anyone can make a motion picture today all it takes is a personal time commitment to the process and access to a credit card , a digital video camera and a computer loaded with 1 , 000 of editing software the result might not be as good as the blair witch project or open water , but it will still be a completed movie the challenge , as it turns out , is actually getting your movie seen as an example , let s take the 2 , 613 feature films up 29 percent from 2 , 023 last year that were submitted to what has become the primary portal for new filmmakers seeking an audience , the sundance film festival , which begins on thursday these completed movies make up the collective hopes and creative output of tens of thousands of talented people but only 120 of these films fewer than 5 percent of all submissions were selected for screening at the festival if it s a good year , maybe , just maybe , 10 of these movies , or 03 percent of the submissions , will be picked up for distribution within the united states what will happen to the remaining 2 , 603 movie submissions \? for the most part , nothing you 'll never see them , not even at your local video rental store without the marketing push , awareness and wordofmouth that s generated by a theatrical release , it s not feasible for video chains to stock your picture of course , sundance is n't the only festival in fact , there are at least 2 , 500 film festivals around the world , so theoretically you could enter your movie in each of those festivals , and hope that it is accepted at one but getting your film considered at all 2 , 500 festivals will require a fair amount of dedication you would have to send out about seven letters of inquiry or dvd screening copies of your movie to different festivals each day for a year , with no days off still , let s say you beat the odds to this point miracle of miracles , your movie gets accepted by a festival and then is picked up for distribution the question now becomes will it ever have more than a minuscule audience \? approximately 450 movies are released in the united states every year by about 30 recognizable distributors of those , major film studios release about half , and independent distributors release the others but the numbers are even tougher than they look , because roughly 90 percent of the boxoffice receipts will be sucked up by the studio releases , leaving about 225 independent releases most likely including your picture to compete for the remaining sales when you realize that there will be only a few independent movies that genuinely captivate the popular imagination every year \( in 2004 those included the passion of the christ , fahrenheit 9 11 and , perhaps , supersize me \) you 'll see what a thin sliver of pie is left for everyone else alternatively , maybe you 'll look at these statistics and realize there s very little chance of financial success or even recognition if you produce an independent film , even if it gets released , so you decide to consider another tack writing your way into the business it worked for francis ford coppola it worked for frank darabont it worked for nora ephron could it work for you \? to protect your story and screenplay , you 'll realize that you want to register it with the writers guild of america , west if somebody tries to rip you off , registration helps you prove you had the idea first so , feeling positive , you go online and register your script then you discover that the guild registered 55 , 000 pieces last year , up nearly 60 percent from 35 , 000 in 2001 \( with fees pegged at 10 for members , 20 for everyone else , registrations appear to pump close to a million dollars from hopefuls around the world through the guild every year \) next , you will need an agent the guild maintains a directory of 93 agencies \( the number fluctuates \) that are guild signatories in california that is , the agencies have agreed to abide by the standards imposed by the professional writers' organization but of the 93 agencies listed , nearly two dozen state flat out that they wo n't accept unsolicited material , and only one says it will consider material from new writers \( it s called qualit dell'arte and it s in woodland hills , calif \) about 70 agencies indicate they might read your work if you are referred to them by an existing client or if you send them a letter of inquiry , but the agencies receive an average of 100 queries each week and can respond positively to only about one each month if an agency does agree to read your script , it goes next to the story department , where readers will synopsize it and offer their critiques this is called coverage a large agency might typically send between 15 , 000 and 30 , 000 projects to coverage each year , including material from new writers as well as existing clients' work now , let s say your script comes back from the story department with glowingly wonderful coverage \( almost none do \) will an agent take you on \? unfortunately , it s not likely an agent may have responsibility for 50 clients , and a new writer is the most difficult of the breed you will consume a great deal of your agent s time as he or she educates people about you and your talents , sends around your script and schedules meetings for you and as you are a new writer , if the agent does make the sale , the price of your script will almost certainly be set at the minimum scale fee , currently about 36 , 000 for a lowbudget script , as prescribed by the writers guild , for your services that s a lot of work for 10 percent of very little but i urge you , stay positive let s assume an agent agrees to sign you , thinks your script is the best material since the day after tomorrow and decides to take it out to the marketplace in a fullblown auction an agency can put a big push behind only one socalled spec script each week , and as many as 20 of these may be vying for the spot , so your agent will have to battle other agents internally \( not a pretty picture \) to get your work into prime position your script will go out to approximately 20 key buyers the eight major studios \( formerly nine , but mgm is selling out to sony \) and a handful of the bigger specialty film houses and independent financiers that can get a movie made each of these , in turn , will send your script to coverage by its story department , and if your spec is hot , it will be covered overnight a major studio s story department may cover 75 to 250 script submissions each week you can imagine the process from this point if your script receives high praise and feels fresh , exciting and imaginative , not to mention commercial , someone might actually buy it every month , in fact , between 20 and 50 spec scripts and pitches are sold \( in 2004 , according to the hollywood reporter , 298 new projects were sold 98 were spec scripts , 87 came from literary material , 70 were pitches , 16 were remakes , 10 were comic books , 6 were truelife stories , 4 came from video games , 2 each derived from television shows and magazine articles , and 1 was from an action figure \) then your project will go into development you 'll be assigned a development executive , who is probably working on at least 30 other projects and who will work to shape your script through rewrites \( some of which may even be done by you \) , package it with talent and as generally happens with fewer than 20 percent of projects in even the leanest studio development pool shepherd it into production so who actually gets a picture made \? already , you 're remembering that the major studios release about 225 movies a year , which means that each studio releases perhaps 30 movies take sony pictures as an example in 2004 sony released 39 movies in the united states , but it did n't actually make all of them six were financed through sony s partnership with revolution studios a whopping 22 were already completed movies acquired by the company s specialty distribution arm , sony pictures classics , and many of these received only a very limited release in new york and los angeles of the theatrical feature films sony actually made , 3 were sequels \( spiderman 2 , superbabies baby geniuses 2 and anacondas the hunt for the blood orchid \) , 2 were remakes , 1 came from a play and 1 from a novella , and 1 was written and directed by a famous writerdirector \( james l brooks s spanglish \) of the 39 movies that sony released only 3 could have possibly come from original , new scripts by promising artists like you or to put it another way there are about a dozen development executives at sony , each of whom is assigned to about 20 to 30 projects yet there were only three produced projects that were n't remakes , sequels , purchased from or paid for by another producer , or derived from novels , comic books or video games so , these dozen executives are competing with each other to get three original movies made , which means each executive has only a 1in4 chance of getting the green light for an original script , most of which will have come from veteran writers with impressive credits by the way , if you successfully navigate hollywood s gauntlet and your movie is made and released , it s unlikely you 'll ever see real money from it a studio movie costs on average 64 million to produce and 62 million to market , for a total average investment of 128 million per film \( and this is just an average many motion pictures have famously cost far more to produce and market \) last year , only 20 movies grossed more than 100 million at the domestic box office , and , after the theaters take their share , only about 50 percent of the boxoffice gross revenue comes back to the studio even though the domestic box office accounts for about 25 percent of total potential film revenues \( booming dvd sales account for a big share of the rest \) , there is rarely much left over from the threeyear income cycle of a feature film profit participations must be deducted and paid to the stars and other luminaries , studio overhead of 20 percent is assessed , distribution fees of 15 to 20 percent are charged , home video marketing costs are recaptured , and the interest accrued on the initial money allocated to produce and market the film is paid off but do n't let these daunting statistics cause you to lose heart hollywood has always been a haven for creative , quixotic types who know it s impossible to get a movie made , yet seek to do the impossible every day and once you 've tasted the delirious rush of seeing one of your movies open at multiplexes across america , there s no stopping the addiction the numbers may be against you , but hang in there because in hollywood , the dream of being no 1 keeps the whole town going even if it happens only 03 percent of the time film expert opinion adam leipzig is president of national geographic feature films
los angeles , feb 20 pete s caf and bar is an upscale place on a decidedly downscale corner in downtown los angeles it is only four blocks from city hall , so mayor james k hahn thought it would be a good place to meet one recent afternoon this could be the start of a great guy walks into a bar story , except it has no punch line the mayor of the secondlargest city in america entered pete s with two bodyguards and a press aide , and nothing happened no heads turned , no conversations stopped , no wellwishers or job seekers or gripers walked over to bend his ear the midafternoon crowd was fairly sparse , but for a mayor seeking reelection less than three weeks from now , it was not a good sign mr hahn , the son of a legendary and popular county supervisor , has not left a strong imprint on this city and appears to be vulnerable as he seeks a second fouryear term several city departments have been accused of steering contracts to the mayor s campaign contributors and although the inquiries have not reached directly into the mayor s office , mr hahn has been damaged by the perception that there is a paytoplay system in city government sixteen months ago , california s notoriously cranky electorate threw out a governor , gray davis , who shares with mr hahn a notable lack of charisma , and replaced him with an international film star los angeles voters likewise may be looking for a little more sizzle in their top elected official none of the three main rivals to replace mr hahn can be mistaken for arnold schwarzenegger , but it is hard not to look lively next to mr hahn the nonpartisan mayoral primary is march 8 if no one wins 50 percent of the vote , the top two candidates will meet in a runoff in may the mayor , a 54yearold democrat who has held elected office as city attorney and city controller for most of his adult life , is aware of his image as a buttoneddown plodder and tries to sell it as a strength i am not arnold schwarzenegger , the tall , slim and grayhaired mr hahn said as he sipped a glass of tap water at pete s i do n't have the body of arnold schwarzenegger i do n't have his acting career i have nothing like his star power but this town has plenty of movie stars , he went on what this town needs is a mayor who is serious about getting things done yet this is just what mr hahn s main challengers , all democrats , say los angeles lacks his top rivals are robert m hertzberg , a lawyer from the san fernando valley and a former speaker of the state assembly bernard c parks , a member of the city council and the former chief of the police department whom mr hahn pushed out of office three years ago and antonio villaraigosa , a city councilman and also a former speaker of the assembly all the candidates fault mr hahn for what they call a slender record of accomplishments and the whiff of scandal surrounding city contracts they also contend that he lacks vision and is a poor salesman for one of the most dynamic and diverse cities in the world if we had a mayor , i would n't be running , mr hertzberg said the guy is just invisible mr hertzberg , 50 , is in many ways the opposite of mr hahn he is burly and gregarious , famous for hugging strangers during an interview at art s deli in the studio city neighborhood , he was repeatedly approached by customers and waitresses as he wolfed down a corned beef sandwich , a plate of new pickles and three unneeded cups of coffee everything in politics is personal , mr hertzberg said it s all personal mr hertzberg compared mayor hahn with his father , kenneth hahn , who was a los angeles county supervisor for 40 years he s the son of a great politician who filled every pothole , went to every wedding , mr hertzberg said but jim does n't understand the nature of the job he s transactional he cobbles together enough votes to survive there s just no connection between the mayor and the people , mr hertzberg said he s not a giuliani , a bloomberg or a daley mr hertzberg , who represented part of the densely populated san fernando valley in the assembly for six years , said mr hahn alienated thousands of potential supporters with his vigorous opposition to a 2002 ballot proposal that would have allowed the valley to secede from the city of los angeles the measure failed citywide , but passed by a small margin among valley voters but mr hertzberg said the mayor s victory came at a cost he beat back secession in a way that angered people , he said he always referred to the valley as 'out there ' valley residents , who account for more than 40 percent of the city electorate , were an important part of mr hahn s winning coalition four years ago , and the mayor s political advisers acknowledge that he has lost some of that vote los angeles lacks strong political machines and a racial majority a winning candidate must appeal across geographic , racial and ethnic lines in the last mayoral election , mr hahn patched together a coalition , winning 80 percent of the black vote and 60 percent of the white vote , to defeat mr villaraigosa , a latino from the east side of the city , by seven percentage points mr hahn s appeal to africanamerican voters was twofold one reason was his family name his father for years faithfully represented south and central los angeles , the core of the city s black population the other was the support of mr parks , who is africanamerican and who was then the city s police chief six months after the election , though , mr hahn surprised the political establishment and angered black residents when he forced mr parks from his job the police department was plagued by charges of brutality and corruption , crime was rising , and morale in the department was falling mr hahn and the city police commission brought in as the new chief william bratton , the crimebusting former new york police commissioner , who is more visible in los angeles than any of the mayoral candidates in the city council , mr parks , 61 , who has a severe and upright demeanor , heads the budget committee he has frequently battled mr hahn , opposing his plan to raise the city sales tax to pay for hiring more police officers , for example many people , including aides to the mayor , characterize mr parks s campaign as an act of political revenge that s the farthest thing from the truth , mr parks said in an interview at his headquarters this is about the mayor s inability to run this city he has an answer for everything , but he does n't have a solution for anything mr parks would not be the first black mayor of los angeles tom bradley took office in 1973 and served for 20 years but no latino has occupied the city s highest office since 1872 , when the city had fewer than 10 , 000 residents mr villaraigosa came close in 2001 , when he lost to mr hahn in a runoff after beating him in the primary he electrified latinos , who showed up at the polls in record numbers , and he enjoyed the support of the unions and the city s political and financial establishment but his base proved too small when white voters shied away from him after mr hahn ran a commercial highlighting mr villaraigosa s support of clemency for a convicted drug dealer whose sentence was eventually commuted by president bill clinton mr villaraigosa , slender and impeccably dressed , complained over a cup of coffee at a starbucks in the little tokyo district that mr hahn had sunk to racebaiting in their last contest i believe jim hahn will do and say anything to get reelected , including his efforts to create a climate of fear , mr villaraigosa said it will not work a second time people know me now i 've been councilman for a year and a half the product of a broken home in the city s heavily hispanic east side , mr villaraigosa , 52 , dropped out of high school but eventually put himself through law school he failed the bar exam four times before passing he went on to become the speaker of the california assembly , preceding mr hertzberg like mr parks , he was elected to the city council in 2003 as much as he tries to play down the role of race in mayoral politics , mr villaraigosa knows his heritage is a factor although latinos make up 46 percent of the population in los angeles , they account for only 25 percent of the electorate and some of that vote is likely to be claimed by a fifth candidate , richard alarcon , a 51yearold latino and state senator from the northern san fernando valley who is trailing in the polls mutual distrust among blacks , latinos and whites still simmers around the city , requiring a deft political touch to piece together a winning coalition it is not clear whether mayor hahn can pull it off again and if he cannot , who can so far the public has paid little attention to the contest many political analysts expect mr hahn to survive the primary he has the support of much of organized labor in the city because he has been generous with patronage and contracts , but he generates very little enthusiasm elsewhere but mr hahn does have the advantages of money , incumbency and name recognition he s 'none of the above , ' said fernando j guerra , director of the center for the study of los angeles at loyola marymount university in this crowded field and this dynamic , that s not a bad place to be he does n't care what people say about him he just wants to win and then he 'll be sworn in again
in a volatile housing dispute in an east side apartment complex steeped in traditions of rent regulation and tenants' rights , residents of the peter cooper village are threatening a lawsuit and a rent strike over the insistence by the metropolitan life insurance company , the landlord , that they use personalized electronic entry cards instead of keys the cards , which have become common in manhattan hotels and office buildings , are described by metlife as essential to ensuring security at the 2 , 480unit apartment complex but many residents of the complex , on first avenue between 20th and 23rd streets built by metlife immediately after world war ii in a utopian vision of clean , wellkept housing for returning servicemen who might otherwise flee to the suburbs said yesterday that the landlord s demand crossed the line into an invasion of tenants' privacy and it has not been lost on either side that the system would make it easier to identify and remove people who illegally sublet apartments , since only those who can show they have a valid lease or are screened by security would qualify for entry metlife also owns stuyvesant town , a larger 8 , 750unit complex just to the south of peter cooper village , and the company acknowledged yesterday that a similar technology could be used there a march 30 deadline has been set for peter cooper village residents to get the new cards , or potentially be locked out as in most new york city landlordtenant disagreements , this one has generated an intense level of vitriol this is not security , it is surveillance , said steven sanders , a state assemblyman who lives at peter cooper village it smacks of totalitarian police state tactics assemblyman sanders said in a news release that a rent strike , threatened by the complex s tenant association to begin in april unless metlife retreats from its demand , would be one of the largest in city history richard shea , a spokesman for metlife , said yesterday that the keycard system was a part of a whole system of security enhancements that are intended the maintain a level of safety , and that the company had no intention of invading tenants' privacy or preventing the friends or families from entering the complex although electronic entry cards have made small inroads into new york city apartment buildings residents of the huge manhattan plaza on west 43rd street have used them for years experts say none have imposed the technology proposed for peter cooper village under the metlife plan , each key card would bear a photograph , taken by building security , of the authorized cardholder duplicate cards for family members , accepted frequent visitors or others could be obtained only with management s permission the dispute could have broader implications for tenants and landlords across the city , according to real estate executives , because of the technological advantages the electronic entry provides building owners it is a big investment that probably only would make sense in large manhattan buildings , said joseph strasburg , president of the rent stabilization association , a property owners group he said that several recently completed towers in manhattan had been equipped with keycard systems , but that the technology had not become widespread it does make sense to building owners as a way of keeping track of who is coming and going , mr strasburg said i would think that the comfort level will improve among tenants and building owners , and it will catch on but that comfort level is rare among the tenants of peter cooper village , where tenantlandlord relations were long considered a model of cooperation , but are now badly frayed we used to refer to metlife as 'mother met , ' said al doyle , president of the stuyvesant town peter cooper village tenants' association our landlord was considered very benevolent , very fair , but that is certainly not true anymore mr doyle said residents had been asked to attend a meeting on saturday and to vote on a rent strike beginning april 1 if the dispute with metlife is not resolved jack lester , a lawyer for the tenants' group , said he would file a motion in state supreme court on monday seeking an injunction to prevent any tenant from being locked out of the building mr shea said the anxiety over the plan for the new system , which was first presented to tenants in late 2003 , was unwarranted he said tenants' photographs were needed as a backup system of identifying people authorized to be in the complex in the case of a power outage or failure of the electronic door locks the keys are to be used in the doors leading to the lobbies of all buildings in the complex and to laundry areas , but not in the doors to people s apartments , where conventional key locks will be retained and mr shea said fears that the system would be used to restrict access to the complex by people who are close to tenants were unfounded so i'm a 30day houseguest i get a 30day key , he said in interviews yesterday , residents of the complex that runs along the franklin d roosevelt drive said the system was largely opposed by tenants pamela turkel , who has lived in the complex for 20 years , said she was convinced that metlife s intention was to identify illegal subletters and to encourage even valid leaseholders to move out although tenants are protected by rent stabilization rules , metlife has seized upon changes in state law that allow landlords who make improvements after tenants move out , and who can command more than 2 , 000 a month in rent , to free their apartments from stabilization constraints this place used to be a model for middleincome residents , she said now they just want as much money as possible from us another resident , who would not give his name , said he was in favor of the new system , and that his views on the subject would likely alienate his neighbors i am happy to get the illegal sublets out , he said people are subletting , moving to florida and renting for more money than they pay despite the deadline in two weeks , mr shea said the complex s management and security personnel would ease the transition nobody is going to get locked out in the cold , he said
baghdad , iraq , sunday , july 17 a suicide bomber wrapped in explosives detonated himself next to a gasoline tanker south of baghdad on saturday night , creating a devastating fireball that killed at least 59 and wounded 86 , an iraqi police official said the bombing , one the most deadly suicide attacks since the american invasion of iraq , appeared to target a nearby shiite mosque and a crowded openair market and came as the streets teemed with cars , pedestrians , shoppers and worshipers enjoying the relative cool of the evening the bombing , in musayyib , about 40 miles south of the capital , was the latest in an unrelenting string of dramatic suicide bombings that have killed scores of people and severely challenged the american command , which only a month ago claimed that military offensives had sharply undermined the ability of the insurgents to launch attacks and cut the number of suicide bombings in half earlier on saturday , another bomber strapped with explosives blew himself up next to a police station in mosul , killing five iraqi police officers in baghdad , which has has been subjected to a surge in suicide attacks , there were two strikes in one , a bomber driving a minibus attacked an american military convoy , wounding a civilian , an official at the interior ministry said several hours later , a car bomber attacked a convoy of commandos from the interior ministry in the dora neighborhood of baghdad , killing two commandos and wounding 11 , including 4 civilians , the official said the surge in suicide attacks in baghdad began last sunday , when an attacker detonated an explosive vest outside an iraqi army recruiting center , killing at least 23 volunteers and wounding at least 40 others on wednesday , a car bomb aimed at an american unit on patrol killed more than two dozen people , most of them iraqi children on thursday , there was a triple attack on a checkpoint leading into the green zone government compound and on friday , there was a daylong blitz in baghdad in which at least 8 suicide car bombs killed 22 people also on saturday , three british soldiers were killed when a roadside bomb exploded in the south an american soldier was killed and two others wounded by a roadside bomb on saturday afternoon in kirkuk province , the military reported early sunday without issuing further details about the incident meanwhile , the american military command said 11 american soldiers were under investigation after another soldier in their company complained that iraqis had been assaulted after they were caught during what military officials said was an attack on a power plant in southern baghdad the officials did not offer details but said none of the detainees required medical treatment for injuries suicide bombers including those who drive vehicles packed with hundreds of pounds of explosives and those wearing body belts fashioned from explosives and tightly packed ball bearings have become the top operational priority of american commanders , who have referred to the suicide bomb as the insurgents' precisionguided weapon the attack in musayyib was the most deadly suicide bombing since may 4 , when a bomber pretending to be a job seeker blew himself up outside a police recruiting center in erbil , the kurdish provincial capital , killing at least 60 kurds as many as 70 people were killed in baquba last july when a suicide bomber detonated an explosivepacked sedan on a busy street the american and iraqi military commands have been unable to figure out how to fight what appears to be a prolific industry producing car bombs , which american officials say can be assembled and armed in less than an hour the authorities have found it equally difficult to stem the seemingly steady stream of bombers willing to sacrifice their lives for the sunni arabled insurgency , which is trying to destabilize the new americanbacked government , dominated by shiites and kurds it was unclear why the insurgents decided to launch this flurry of bloody attacks this week , but many iraqis had been anticipating a spike in violence tied to sunday , the anniversary of the 1968 baathist revolution that ushered saddam hussein s political party into power officials say many of the top leaders of the insurgency are baathists the abuse charges on saturday against the 11 american soldiers stemmed from an incident that , according to lt col clifford kent , a spokesman for the american military in baghdad , occurred shortly after seven detainees were captured in the act of attacking a power plant in the dora neighborhood of south baghdad on june 20 the uncovering of other cases of american and british abuse against iraqi detainees , particularly the mistreatment of prisoners at abu ghraib disclosed last year , has cost the american military support among iraqis and goodwill worldwide the accusations by a soldier that his fellow soldiers had abused detainees compelled the military to take the extraordinary step of removing the entire company of about 100 soldiers from active duty while the investigation was under way , the military said six of the detainees were eventually released to the iraqi police , and the seventh remains in the custody of allied forces , colonel kent said the charges , if proved , could lead to a range of punishments , or could result in a courtmartial in the other violence on saturday , the three british soldiers were killed and two others wounded by a roadside bomb in maysan province the british military said the attack against its troops happened early saturday morning on a road in amara , a mostly shiite city near the iranian border it brought the number of british deaths in iraq since the 2003 invasion to 92 in a web posting , a group calling itself imam alhussein brigade , apparently a reference to a martyr revered by shiites , claimed responsibility for that attack several militant factions operating in southern iraq are splinter groups of the organization of the shiite cleric moktada alsadr that british officials believe may be behind other recent attacks on their troops after the january elections , mr sadr gained control of the maysan provincial council and broke off formal relations with the british command , sheik abdul sattar albahadli , a senior sadr representative in basra , said in a recent interview in political developments on saturday , prime minister ibrahim aljaafari led a highlevel delegation to iran for a threeday trip intended to mend relations the new iraqi government has sought to repair ties with iran and end tensions that peaked during the iraniraq war from 1980 to 1988 prime minister jaafari s threeday visit is his first to iran in his new official role during saddam hussein s rule , iran was a haven for many shiite opposition leaders , including mr jaafari , and iran was among the first to recognize the iraqi government iran promised last week to contribute 1 billion to iraqi reconstruction efforts after defense minister sadoun aldulaimi of iraq made a formal apology for the war crimes committed under mr hussein and pledged not to allow iraqi soil to be used for attacks against iran in a major agreement announced this month , the countries agreed to build a pipeline between the two southern cities of basra in iraq and abadan in iran to trade oil the two countries resumed diplomatic ties in 2003 , when foreign minister naji sabri went to iran but the two countries have not yet signed a peace treaty iraq has also demanded that iran return 22 planes that mr hussein sent to iran before the persian gulf war in 1991 iran has said it will return the planes only if the united nations asks for them the united states has accused iran of meddling in affairs of iraq , but the departing iranian president , mohammad khatami , said last week that iran did not want to export its islamic revolution in iraq , he said , even though the majority of iraqis are shiite , we never allowed ourselves to impose our model on them
washington , sept 19 combining an old concept , existing equipment and new ideas , nasa gave shape on monday to president bush s promise to send humans back to the moon by the end of the next decade michael d griffin , the agency s new administrator , detailed a 104 billion plan that he said would get astronauts to the moon by 2018 , serve as a steppingstone to mars and beyond , and stay within nasa s existing budget the plan would use a new spacecraft similar to the apollo command capsule of the original moon program , and new rockets made up largely of components from the space shuttle program it is very apollolike , dr griffin said , but bigger think of it as apollo on steroids the plan drew a mixture of praise and criticism from lawmakers and space experts news analysis , page a15 the chairman of the house science committee , representative sherwood boehlert , republican of new york , said it appeared to be the safest , least expensive and most efficient way of moving forward in space exploration , but added that current cost overruns in other nasa programs might make it hard to develop the new vehicle on schedule the outlines of the plan had been disclosed informally over the last two months by nasa officials and space experts but dr griffin s announcement laid out a timetable and a budget , putting flesh on the bones of a proposal that mr bush announced in january 2004 but had never described in detail dr griffin said that after adjusting for inflation , the program would cost just 55 percent of what it cost to put a dozen men on the lunar surface from 1969 to 1972 the payasyougo plan , approved by the white house last week , would stay within nasa s 16billionayear budget through a combination of retiring the space shuttle , finishing the international space station and reallocating money from other nasa programs and dr griffin said the nation could well afford it , despite concern about tight budgets in the wake of hurricane katrina we 're talking about returning to the moon in 2018 , he said at a news conference here in washington there will be a lot more hurricanes and a lot more other natural disasters to befall the united states and the world in that time , i hope none worse than katrina but the space program is a longterm investment in our future we must deal with our shortterm problems while not sacrificing our longterm investments in our future when we have a hurricane , we do n't cancel the air force we do n't cancel the navy and we 're not going to cancel nasa dr griffin and other space advocates , including influential members of congress , have said the united states needs a replacement for the aging shuttle fleet as a matter of national security russia and china are currently capable of human spaceflight , and other countries have expressed interest in following suit dr griffin said the nation must maintain an independent capability to send people into space after the shuttle retires in 2010 the new craft , called the crew exploration vehicle , would perch the astronauts' capsule above the rockets that power it into space , rather than alongside them as with the shuttle nasa officials said it would be 10 times as safe as the shuttle , with a projected failure rate of 1 in 2 , 000 , as opposed to 1 in 220 for the shuttle the increased safety , they said , will be due in part to escape rockets that will be able to jettison the capsule away from the booster rocket in the event of an accident dr griffin said the vehicle would be able to take as many as six astronauts to the space station , or fewer astronauts and some cargo or it could fly robotically without a crew , he added , carrying up some 25 tons of cargo , about as much as a shuttle can carry the wingless craft , weighing 50 percent more than the apollo , could carry a crew of four to the moon as envisioned , the craft would resemble a larger version of the russian spacecraft soyuz , including solarpower panels deployed after launching it would be carried aloft on a modified version of one of the shuttle s solidfueled rocket boosters and a new second stage using one of the shuttle s main liquidfueled engines for moon voyages , the craft would rendezvous in earth orbit with lunar components lifted on a big new cargo rocket this heavycargo rocket , which could put 125 tons into orbit , would comprise two extended shuttle solidfuel boosters attached to a liquid hydrogenoxygen first stage made of an extended shuttle external fuel tank with five shuttle main engines atop this would be a new second stage using one or more of the shuttle main engines the bigger rocket , capable of lifting the payload of the saturn v , which sent men to the moon decades ago , would put into earth orbit another rocket that could carry a landing craft and the crew vehicle to the moon the moon mission would be accomplished in stages first , a vehicle with a lunar lander and a moon rocket would be launched into earth orbit the crew capsule would be launched as much as a month later and would meet the first vehicle in orbit the joined craft would then be propelled to lunar orbit from there , the landing craft would fly to the surface , and its crew of four would spend up to a week exploring afterward , the top part of the twopiece lander would take the crew back to lunar orbit to rendezvous with the crew vehicle , which would have been left there unmanned , for the trip back to earth the bottom part of the lander could be left behind with equipment that might be used by future crews that land nearby , the agency said nearing earth , the crew vehicle would jettison its equipment module before the crew capsule plunged into the atmosphere parachutes would slow the capsule before it landed in the water or on land , possibly at edwards air force base in california the landing would be cushioned by air bags on the craft s bottom or small rockets that fire just before touchdown some of the big military contractors that stand to win multibilliondollar contracts to launch and maintain the new mission vehicles said they were pleased by monday s announcement this is a big deal for us , said michael coats , chief of space exploration for the nation s largest military contractor , the lockheed martin corporation , one of two teams competing to build the crew exploration vehicle today s announcement means that we will have a stable program for a while it would be great for us to compete and win a piece of the business lockheed is the leader of a consortium that currently has a 28 million contract to design the crew exploration vehicle another team , headed by the boeing company and northrop grumman , has an identical contract to design an alternative nasa is expected to select the winning design next spring john e pike , a space policy expert with the consulting firm globalsecurityorg , said nasa needed to sell more people on the value of a moon program if it is to preserve future budgets and continue space exploration the moon may be a source of the rare element helium3 , for instance , which could fuel fusion reactors to provide abundant electricity on earth , he said nasa , mr pike said , needs to have reasons like this to go back to the moon so the program has more stakeholders who see its value and want to protect it
an unlicensed hasidic day care center in staten island serving at least 89 children was shut down yesterday after a fire department inspection , officials said the inspection took place at a building at 289 harold street , in the willowbrook section , used for day care and owned by chabad lubavitch of staten island , a hasidic organization the building , bought in december , is next to a separate day care center called the torah tots academy at 389 bradley avenue , which is also owned by the group children were also cared for in a trailer behind the buildings , the department said in all , 98 children between about 2 and 5 were in the two buildings and the trailer yesterday morning , said battalion chief dominick derubbio the city health department , however , put the number at 89 the harold street building includes a synagogue on the first floor and a basement day care center the fire department said the basement , occupied by about 30 children , lacked sprinklers and sufficient exits rabbi moshe katzman , director of chabad lubavitch of staten island , said the violations concerned only paperwork , and nothing that could have endangered the children we are running a great program here , he said the kids are loved , cared for and safe he said the group had contacted an architect to study the violations and planned to reopen as soon as possible none of the citations issued yesterday alleged that the children were endangered or inadequately supervised the department of buildings and the department of health and mental hygiene also took part in the inspection , and more inspections were pending at the bradley avenue address and at the trailer the inspections and closing drew reporters from several news organizations and created a minor spectacle traumatized a lot of children and parents , said a woman on the telephone in rabbi katzman s office who would not give her name we 're feeling discriminated against big time by everybody according to the fire department , the inspection was scheduled after a lieutenant read an article in the staten island advance last friday in which rabbi katzman announced that the harold street building had been bought and that a celebration was planned fundraising never ends , rabbi katzman was quoted as saying the children were held yesterday until their parents came to pick them up , many arriving at the usual time , around 3 pm , with no inkling that anything was wrong the health department is helping parents find other day care options while the center is closed , according to a department statement one mother , rivka denker , 32 , whose 6yearold son has attended the center for three years , said i do n't know what the problem is they 're beautiful everybody there is beautiful it s clean they take very good care of our children the buildings department cited rabbi katzman for using the harold street address for purposes other than those described on its certificate of occupancy , which describes it simply as a twofamily home , said jennifer givner , a department spokeswoman when our inspectors arrived , we determined the first floor was a synagogue and the cellar was a school , she said the building also lacked a sprinkler system and a second exit from the basement , city officials said they 're not the most imminently hazardous violations , but they are violations , and they could be dangerous , deputy fire chief theodore goldfarb said while praised by parents who spoke to reporters yesterday , the center has its detractors one man said it was difficult to park in the afternoons when parents arrive to pick up their children , and another man , allen braswell , complained of the noise the children make they 're loud , obnoxious and screaming , he said there are a zillion kids going back and forth it disturbs very many neighbors
alan m dershowitz , harvard law school professor and hopeless pack rat , now has a home free of clutter , to the great pleasure of his wife , and it is all thanks to the box to brooklyn when it is filled with court documents or speeches , book notes or the latest hate mail , the box is sent off to join 800 others of mr dershowitz s at brooklyn college s archives he agreed to donate his papers to his alma mater , and it is there that a team of four students now sits in the dershowitz processing room , as it is called , going through it all they hope to have the material culled and cataloged within 18 months mr dershowitz s papers were not sold to the highest bidder , as has become custom , or given to harvard , his longtime employer , because of the role brooklyn college played in his life a combative intellect who liked to provoke for sport , mr dershowitz was a listless student through high school that changed once he got to brooklyn college , a place that mr dershowitz said not only tolerated his troublemaking but also encouraged it in a telephone interview from his office at harvard , he called his acceptance letter from brooklyn college the most important document of his life he recalled challenging the college s anticommunist president harry gideonse and eugene scalia , a professor of romance languages and a wellknown conservative on campus \( and the father of justice antonin scalia of the supreme court \) mr dershowitz said he came of age as an iconoclast in college there was such a difference coming in and going out , he added several years ago , anthony m cucchiara , brooklyn college s archivist and a professor of archival management , answered a phone call from mr dershowitz , who wanted help with some research professor cucchiara held his breath and then popped the question would he donate his papers \? college archives , once tucked away in dusty corners of the campus and run by history buffs who dedicated their careers to talking people into donating long forgotten material , have become bigger business of late norman mailer sold 500 boxes of papers to the university of texas for 25 million , making a point of mentioning that they contained reminiscences of the bonds he had forged with soldiers from texas in world war ii the university of texas also has the papers of isaac bashevis singer , another writer not normally associated with the lone star state and instead of going to the national archives or one of their own alma maters , bob woodward and carl bernstein sent their watergate papers to the university of texas in 2003 for 5 million boston university acquired the papers of w somerset maugham in a sotheby s auction professor cucchiara said that with mr dershowitz , there was a minimum of romancing before he was making trips to cambridge , returning in a rental van with boxes labeled simpson , von b low , milken and tyson there were also documents from civil rights cases and video and audio tapes from mr dershowitz s sideline as a talking head on television and the radio for mr dershowitz , class of 1959 , it was payback of a kind i got to go to brooklyn college for free , which was about what i could afford , he said in fact , since i got a scholarship , i actually made money on college in the dershowitz processing room on a recent workday , tatyana lotarevich looked up from a computer to shake her head at just how much work of different types , from trials to geraldo appearances , that mr dershowitz has produced he must have a lot of time on his hands , she said the students , who have been working since january , are paid about 10 an hour david kay , trying to bring order to mr dershowitz s vast volume of radio tapes , said he was amazed at how someone could center his life in an academic institution and also have his pinkie in so many other pies because of issues of attorneyclient privilege , it is unclear when some of the dershowitz material can be exhibited , and none will be available for researchers until it is fully inventoried the dershowitz room has been only one center of action at brooklyn college s archives of late in preparation for an exhibit honoring the school s 75th anniversary , the college s archivists decided to delve deeply into old boxes of stored material most of the material was cataloged , but the archivists had no notion of what they would find in the seven climatecontrolled floors , each filled with boxes packed with campus documents and trinkets from the past their goal , however , was clear to make the exhibit , which is scheduled to be seen through the rest of 2005 in the school s library , as compelling as possible professor cucchiara is wry about his work , which pairs an abiding curiosity for the past with more mundane tasks , like lugging boxes there is such physicality to it , he said , that i sometimes feel like a sanitation worker he spends his days in the carefully regulated air of the archive , leaving at night for the famously stale air of gleason s gym in brooklyn , where he spars in the boxing ring of all the newly found material , professor cucchiara s favorite is a snapshot of an unknown woman who is the exhibit s emblem the pennant woman , as he calls her , is in professor cucchiara s opinion the prototypical brooklyn college student determined , playful and proud on a walkway and carrying a brooklyn college pennant , the woman has her head tipped ever so slightly with pride as she shares the slightest of secret smiles with the camera also newly uncovered was a film of president franklin d roosevelt visiting the campus in 1936 for the dedication of roosevelt hall school officials had known that photographs of the visit existed , but they had no idea that motion pictures had been buried in a box since the dershowitz material is not yet organized , only a single piece of paper from his collection is exhibited a hate letter , calling him a disgrace , among other things as a lawyer who accepts tough cases , mr dershowitz said that hate mail was a badge of honor in fact , papers that will not be put in the box to brooklyn until after he dies are his alltime favorite hate letters , which he keeps posted outside his office for all visitors particularly his students to see a criminal defense attorney has to be as proud of his enemies as of his friends , mr dershowitz said
wall street has been pining for the government to back off and let it get back to making money without the interference of many competing , sometimes politically motivated regulators it now appears the street will get its wish with the chairman of the securities and exchange commission , william h donaldson , and a democratic commissioner , harvey j goldschmid , heading for the exits , president bush will be able to reshape the commission the white house nominee , representative christopher cox , republican of california , seems a likely candidate to lead a commission far more sympathetic to wall street but is less regulation good for the capital markets right now \? the evidence is less than overwhelming take the case of hedge fund registration , one of mr donaldson s legacies over the protests of just about everyone , including the chairman of the federal reserve , alan greenspan , mr donaldson hammered through a rule requiring that hedge fund advisers register with the commission , essentially requiring that the funds send in their addresses and affirm that none of their employees are felons \( the agency can also conduct routine exams and penalize firms faster if they do break the law \) it did not seem to be asking much , but the protest inside the commission and outside was vociferous one of the two republican commissioners , paul atkins , argued that the sec did not have the resources to regulate the fastgrowing hedge fund industry effectively hedge funds argued that the compliance costs of regulation would stymie innovation mr greenspan said that hedge funds helped diversify risk in the financial system and that slowing their growth would be detrimental these hardly seem reasons to step aside not every criminal is caught , but you do n't hear calls to abolish police forces having a regulator that is trying to grapple with the issues , working in concert with the federal reserve and spending time thinking about the issues that hedge funds themselves do n't have time to think about , is not a danger to the system it is a safety net , even if it may be a flawed one finance is becoming more complex , but the response of the sec should not be to retreat hedge funds trade in complex investments , sometimes at lightning speed and in places from des moines to dakar at the same time , most securities firms are taking in more money from trading than from making deals , making more on complex credit derivatives than on stocks and far more as investors than as middlemen the sec will have to adapt to all of this to police effectively the commission will undoubtedly fail in some ways but ignoring the new reality of the securities industry would simply guarantee failure as one former federal law enforcement official noted even ineffective regulation has an effect on the parties being regulated you ca n't count on them being incompetent the problem with wall street s complaining about too much regulation is that its record is abysmal this week , citigroup agreed to pay 208 million to settle allegations that it shortchanged mutual fund investors by denying them certain discounts \( and lying about it \) a once highflying fund manager , alberto w vilar , meanwhile , has been accused of taking millions of his investors' dollars regulators could do better the turf war among the sec , the new york attorney general and the justice department , not to mention nasd and the new york stock exchange , is costly and at times , dangerous prosecutors should not be legislators and rule makers should not be business strategists the solution of course is simple if wall street stopped breaking the rules , enforcement cases would abate and regulation would be scaled back to be sure , the sec has created its own quandary now that it has stepped into hedge fund regulation , it is in the untenable situation of having to do it effectively as mr atkins notes , it is unclear if the commission has the resources , the technology or the expertise to do so rest assured that when a hedge fund blows up along with the retirement savings of teachers in ohio , politicians and others will waste no time blaming the sec \( you said you were on the case , right \? \) but consider the alternative a more laissezfaire chairman arrives and rolls back the registration requirement the system hits a glitch , the sec is skewered for being asleep at the switch and congress rams through the next sarbanesoxley law for hedge funds laissezfaire becomes draconian regulation and wall street starts complaining about overly zealous regulators all over again as winston churchill said about democracy it s the worst system , except for all the others handsoff regulation for an industry obsessed with making money has n't worked in the past adopting reasonable rules and tweaking them to make them effective is clearly more desirable mr donaldson realized this when he disregarded the cacophony of protest over hedge fund registration
a no 5 starting pitcher , a reserve catcher and a 217 hitter gave momentum to the improbable yesterday at shea stadium if kazuhisa ishii can upstage a potential cy young award candidate if ramon castro can play a more complete game than mike piazza and if doug mientkiewicz can show greater power than any first baseman the mets might acquire in a trade , perhaps this team will contend for a playoff spot after all the mets began to ponder such previously remote possibilities after their fringe members thrashed the san diego padres , 120 , completing a threegame sweep over the national league west leaders for the first time since early may , the mets have won four games in a row , and for the first time since early june , they are in third place in the national league east players who could not reach a consensus on what song to blast over the clubhouse stereo agreed that this was their best series of the season we need to push further , manager willie randolph said hopefully , it s the right time to let everybody know in the division that we 're for real now and we 're going to compete all the way through hopefully , it s the right time to make a move unlikely sources are leading the stampede pitching to retain his spot in the rotation , ishii threw six scoreless innings hitting to hold on to his spot in the starting lineup , mientkiewicz sparked the mets with a homer proving that he can spell piazza on a regular basis , castro hit a tworun homer , threw out a runner on a steal attempt and coaxed ishii through a couple of early jams the mets matched their largest margin of victory this season and posted their largest margin over san diego shea stadium is turning into the home of oddball baseball facing the allstar pitcher jake peavy yesterday , ishii looked more like the ace and peavy looked like the punching bag in the fifth and sixth innings , the mets scored 11 runs , 6 off peavy and 5 off the yankees' reject paul quantrill seven mets starters drove in at least one run , and seven starters scored at least one run the onslaught was born in large part late wednesday night , when third baseman david wright noticed that mientkiewicz was slow in moving his hands through the hitting zone wright cued up some of mientkiewicz s game tapes in the clubhouse to illustrate his point in mientkiewicz s first atbat yesterday , he ripped a ball foul down the firstbase line wow , mientkiewicz said that reminds me of somebody he promptly hit his 10th home run of the season , raised his batting average to 223 , and the mets did not stop scoring their sevenrun sixth inning lasted so long that wright had two hits in it because wright was also celebrating the first anniversary of his major league promotion , teammates teased him with a sign over his locker congratulations on 1 year in the big leagues i have no idea who did that , wright said when the mets' veterans reported to shea stadium yesterday for a rare 12 10 pm game , they were met with an alarming sight wright and jos reyes , each 22 years old , were bouncing around the clubhouse as if they had ingested too many skittles left fielder cliff floyd , still groggy from a night game wednesday , tried to rub the sleep out of his eyes i love it , floyd said twelveten game and we 've got guys jumping around here and having fun his tone has changed markedly in a year after san diego swept a fourgame series from the mets at shea last season , floyd enraged club officials when he questioned whether there was any light at the end of the tunnel the padres have presumably improved , but the teams seem to have switched roles looking uninspired in this series , san diego outfielders misjudged two routine fly balls and their catchers made two errant throws into center field second baseman mark loretta even managed to bunt into a 153 double play yesterday ishii was grateful for the assistance , especially since he had not pitched in 12 days and the mets were considering whether to remove him from the rotation although ishii issued five walks , his usual allotment , he scattered four hits , none for extra bases if everybody does n't write negative things about me , this will probably feel even better , ishii told reporters through his interpreter the mets may eventually conclude that ishii has more potential than the other pitchers lobbying to fill out their starting rotation they may also decide to stick with mientkiewicz at first base rather than trade for someone like cincinnati s sean casey , who makes 8 million a year and has only four home runs they may even find it easier to rest piazza with castro waiting behind him i know i wo n't play a lot here , castro said but when i do , i 'll prove what i can do such is the mood around the mets , who finished a series in which they got a gamewinning homer from pinchhitter chris woodward , a homer from carlos beltran in a game pedro mart nez was not pitching , and homers from mientkiewicz and castro in a game dominated by ishii given how many upsets occurred in the past three days , no one was about to tell the mets they could not contend
a 7yearold boy from connecticut was killed yesterday when he got stuck in a conveyor belt propelling a water ride at the playland amusement park in rye , ny , the westchester county police said the boy , who was not identified by the authorities , was riding alone about 4 pm in a boat through ye old mill , a sixminute trip through a darkened tunnel the police said they believed the boy had somehow gotten out of the front or back of the boat near the start of the ride he was the second child to die on a playland ride in the last two years in may 2004 , a 7yearold girl died on a ride called the mind scrambler when she wriggled out of a protective lap bar to wave to a friend there are no seat belts or other protective devices on ye old mill and the boy was about 6 inches taller than the 42inch height requirement , park officials said the boy s mother had taken him to the entrance of the ride and allowed him to enter on his own , the authorities said she became alarmed when the boat her son had been riding in came out of the tunnel and he was not on board the boy was discovered pinned in the conveyor belt about 4 pm and the ride was closed one of his sneakers was found floating in the water further along the ride officials of the park , which is owned by westchester county , also planned to close the park at 6 30 pm , but andrew j spano , the county executive , ordered that it stay open until its normal 11 pm closing hour hundreds of families were still at the park late last night mr spano called the accident a tremendous tragedy , but said there was no evidence of any mechanical malfunction or wrongdoing by park employees it is one of the safest parks in the world , mr spano said during a news conference last night i ca n't tell you how upset i am personally , he said i love coming here because you see kids smiling in fact , if you go out right now , you 'll see the same thing officials from the state department of labor and the county police will investigate the accident , mr spano said last summer , when stephanie dieudonn of new rochelle was killed , investigations concluded that the park had not been at fault county officials later commissioned a study that included several recommendations on improving the park , including a stricter enforcement of height and weight restrictions for all the rides although there is a camera on the water ride , there was no film in it at the time of the accident , mr spano said , and none of the other passengers were questioned about what had happened , said thomas belfiore , the county s commissioner of public safety an electronic swipe card is needed to enter the rides mr belfiore said this could enable investigators to track down passengers who were on the ride at the time of the accident because the ride s tunnel is so narrow , it would be nearly impossible for anyone to fall out of a boat from the sides , said joseph montalto , the director of playland we have no reason to rule anything out and are continuing to investigate , mr montalto said it would not be unusual for someone to jump out , he added , referring to rides generally ye old mill , originally built in 1929 , underwent minor renovations to its scenery three years ago , mr montalto said fourteen boats are propelled along the 1 , 200footlong ride by the conveyor belt and a water stream from a large mill the depth of the water traveled by the boats is less than two and a half feet i 've always considered it one of our most benign rides , mr spano said most people at the park last night seemed unaware of the accident , though a few had heard an earlier announcement that the park would close early lines continued to snake through the park after 9 pm last night , as fireworks went off as scheduled overhead i'm not concerned at all , said mary downes , who came to the park with her two young sons last night it s really slow , she said of the ride there s nothing that jumps out to scare you the only difference between that and the kiddiepark rides is that you go through a tunnel
st louis , sept 11 the circumstances were slightly different the last time pedro mart nez pitched at busch stadium it was oct 26 , 2004 , and mart nez s boston red sox were seeking a victory to go up by three games to none in the world series on sunday , mart nez s mets needed a victory to prevent a seventh straight defeat in the last game of their agonizing trip mart nez never seems to feel pressure he would not be pedro mart nez if he did and yet he said he sensed a greater urgency to win sunday than he did 11 months ago , on the grandest stage of baseball , while pitching for a team that had not won a world championship in 86 years in the world series , it was easier for me to relax , mart nez said i had a space to actually make mistakes but the way we 're looking right now , it seems like we 're not going to last very long if we continue to lose games the way we were mart nez was taking the losing streak personally , and when he walked into the clubhouse on sunday morning dressed in black and wearing his designer sunglasses , he looked like a man not to be messed with he scattered eight hits over eight innings , benefiting from four double plays and striking out seven , as the mets defeated the cardinals , 72 , for their first victory here since aug 9 , 2002 that he did so against a cardinals lineup that appeared more suited for a spring training intrasquad game made no difference to the mets a 28 trip still feels better than a 19 one the mets had lost six in a row it s just nice to stop the bleeding right now , manager willie randolph said the mets had 13 hits against three cardinals pitchers they were led by mike jacobs and ramon castro , who each had two hits and runscoring doubles , and victor diaz , who punctuated the afternoon with a threerun homer in the ninth inning the eruption of offense was a pleasant surprise the mets played without their cleanup hitter , cliff floyd , who rested a strained left hamstring that tightened overnight , and mike piazza , who sustained a minor concussion after being beaned by julian tavarez on saturday floyd said he would play tuesday piazza said he could have played sunday , and was clearly seething about the saturday incident he responded to questions about his condition with short answers i'm ok i'm all right i'm fine and said he did not want to revisit the issue asked if he held any ill will toward tavarez or the cardinals , piazza arranged some belongings in his locker and waited several seconds before saying , no comment cardinals manager tony la russa rested the sluggers jim edmonds and larry walker , removed albert pujols after the seventh and substituted liberally in the eighth , after mart nez topped 100 pitches and found himself in some trouble , randolph left him in to face the likes of scott seabol , john gall and einar diaz the thing about pedro is that even if he s a little bit gassed , he can make pitches for you , randolph said i had a feeling that against some of those young , inexperienced hitters , he 'd be able to make a pitch , and he did after seabol singled , bringing runners to first and third with one out , mart nez induced a runscoring groundout from gall and struck out diaz on a vicious slider mart nez \( 147 \) pointed to the heavens on his way to the dugout , appearing confident that he was on his way to another meaningful victory here inside pitch carlos beltran hit a solo homer in the seventh inning it was his 15th homer of the season , and his ninth in a pedro mart nez start the mets wore hats honoring seven new york service agencies that had members killed in the terrorist attacks of sept 11 , 2001
a thorough exploration of aaron copland s music , with a comprehensive look at the 20thcentury american culture that shaped him and that he shaped , seems a natural idea and a likely audience draw so the most astonishing thing about the festival copland and his world at bard college is that it was so long in coming bard began presenting its composerthemed summer festivals in 1990 , the year of copland s 90th birthday \( he died that december \) but that first summer , the subject was brahms at the copland centenary , in 2000 , the festival , in annandaleonhudson , ny , was devoted to beethoven in its first 15 years , bard has examined only one thoroughly american composer , charles ives \( in 1996 \) , although a few of its other subjects bartok \( 1995 \) , schoenberg \( 1999 \) and mahler \( 2002 \) had important links to the united states now bard is more than making up for its tardiness in addition to three weekends of copland and his world \( aug 12 to 14 and 19 to 21 , and oct 21 to 23 \) , the college s summerscape series \( of which the festival is a part \) is offering other programs that touch on copland s time this weekend , for instance , a highlight is a staging of regina , by marc blitzstein , a composer who shared with copland both an eclectic musical sensibility and a progressive political outlook , and in the weeks to come \( starting on thursday \) , the blitzstein work competes with a production of copland s only fullscale opera , the tender land summerscape s film series includes several productions for which copland wrote the music , including of mice and men \( thursday \) , the city and the cummington story \( aug 7 \) , our town \( aug 11 \) and the red pony \( aug 14 \) all this attention seems only right , or at least it does to a critic who grew up in the years when copland was regarded , with something close to unanimity , as the dean of american composers more than ives , the quirky loner , and more than copland s most famous contemporaries , like virgil thomson , samuel barber , roy harris and william schuman , he was for several generations the personification of american composition still , those composers , as well as others who wrote in a more rigorous , international style roger sessions and elliott carter , among them helped create an atmosphere of both collegiality and competition that was essential to their shared goal of establishing an american compositional style , or styles new music of the new world it was not , after all , as if copland had invented american music , or claimed to he was fully aware of centurystraddling american composers like george whitefield chadwick and edward macdowell , who wrote in an essentially germanic style , as well as charles tomlinson griffes , who was more inclined , like copland , toward french impressionism there was also a line that stretched back to the early and mid19th century , when anthony philip heinrich and homer newton bartlett affixed american names \( like heinrich s dawning of music in kentucky \) to works cast in european forms , and when louis moreau gottschalk built a concert career playing lisztian fantasies on both old and new world themes just before copland s time , scott joplin s ragtime classics might have become an american parallel to the array of nationalistic european styles that ran from chopin through alb \? z and granados , and arthur farwell tried to take up dvorak s suggestion that an american voice could be found in native american chants and dances and then there was ives , the crusty new england iconoclast who wove hymns , marches and patriotic songs into his often dissonant harmonic fabric , and his friend carl ruggles , whose musical vision of america was daring , idiosyncratic and often muscular one thing copland had that these composers lacked is a critical mass of likeminded colleagues and competitors , as well as sympathetic performers , all pushing to have american composition taken seriously on the world stage bard s programs offer an overview of this thriving milieu , sometimes to a fault in some programs , the context is so rich that copland nearly fades into the background a program called paris , boulanger and jazz , for example , includes copland s early , cartoonishly descriptive piano work the cat and the mouse \( 1920 \) and his four motets \( 1921 \) , among works by nine other composers , including several whose jazztinged compositions \( stravinsky s ragtime , milhaud s cr \? ion du monde and gershwin s three preludes , among them \) influenced copland s own hybrids another , celebrating copland s efforts as a promoter of new music , through composer societies , publications and his own conducting , includes only one of his works \( the 1930 piano variations \) , alongside scores by seven other composers , from ives and ruggles to sessions and var \? and a program devoted to neoclassicism includes copland s violin sonata amid works by stravinsky , piston , diamond , fine and others many shades of copland but even if copland s works are vastly outnumbered , these thematic programs trace the contours of his career they also touch on a longstanding point of contention in the world of copland studies \( or even merely copland listening \) specifically , how many coplands are there \?
africanamerican teenagers are beset on all sides by dangerous myths about race the most poisonous one defines middleclass normalcy and achievement as white , while embracing violence , illiteracy and drug dealing as authentically black this fiction rears its head from time to time in films and literature but it finds its most virulent expression in rap music , which started out with a broad palette of themes but has increasingly evolved into a medium for worshipping misogyny , materialism and murder this dangerous narrowing of hiphop music would be reason for concern in any case but it is especially troubling against the backdrop of the 1990 s , when rappers provoked a realworld gang war by using recordings and music videos to insult and threaten rivals two of the music s biggest stars tupac shakur and the notorious big were eventually shot to death people who pay only minimal attention to the rap world may have thought the killings would sober up the rap community not quite the may cover of the hiphop magazine vibe was on the mark when it depicted fallen rappers standing among tombstones under the headline hiphop murders why have n't we learned anything \? the cover may have been prompted in part by a rivalry between two rappers that culminated in a shootout at a new york radio station , hot 97 , earlier this spring the events that led up to the shooting show how recording labels now exploit violence to make and sell recordings at the center of that hot 97 shootout was none other than 50 cent , whose given name is curtis jackson iii mr jackson is a confessed former drug dealer who seems to revel in the fact that he was shot several times while dealing in queens he has also made a career of beef recordings , in which he whips up controversy and heightens tension by insulting rival artists he was following this pattern in a radio interview in march when a rival showed up at the station the story s murky , but it appears that the rival s entourage met mr jackson s on the street , resulting in gunfire mr jackson s onair agitation was clearly timed to coincide with the release of the massacre , his grotesquely violent and misogynist compact disc the cd cover depicts the artist standing before a wall adorned with weapons , pointing what appears to be a shotgun at the camera the photographs in the liner notes depict every ghetto stereotype the artist selling drugs , the artist in a gunfight and includes a mock autopsy report that has been seen as a covert threat aimed at some of his critics the massacre promotion raises the ante in a most destructive way new artists , desperate for stardom , will say or do anything to win notice and buzz for their next projects as the trend escalates , innercity listeners who are already at risk of dying prematurely are being fed a toxic diet of rap cuts that glorify murder and make it seem perfectly normal to spend your life in prison critics who have been angered by this trend have pointed at jimmy iovine , the music impresario whose interscope records reaped millions on gangster rap in the 90 s mr iovine makes a convenient target as a white man who is lording over an essentially black art form but also listed on the massacre as an executive producer is the legendary rapper dr dre , a black man who happens to be one of the most powerful people in the business dr dre has a unique vantage point on raprelated violence he was cofounder of death row records , an infamous california company that marketed west coast rap in the 1990 s and had a frontrow seat for the feud that led to so much bloodshed back then the music business hopes to make a financial killing on a recently announced summer concert tour that is set to feature 50 cent and the megaselling rap star eminem but promoters will need to make heavy use of metal detectors to suppress the kind of gunrelated violence that gangster artists celebrate that this lethal genre of art has grown speaks volumes about the industry s greed and lack of selfcontrol but trends like this reach a tipping point , when business as usual becomes unacceptable to the public as a whole judging from the rising hue and cry , hiphop is just about there
player agents are betting their clients' money that there wo n't be a baseball work stoppage in 2007 that season is the first after the current collectivebargaining agreement expires , and before that agreement , achieved in 2002 , negotiations for new contracts had always produced work stoppages in the major leagues in the past , with the threat of a strike or a lockout in mind , agents had negotiated lower salaries in multiyear contracts for the seasons that they felt might be in jeopardy because of a work stoppage the less money allocated , the agents reasoned , the less money a player could lose but agents have not followed that pattern this offseason the agreement expires in 53 weeks dec 19 , 2006 which ostensibly makes the 2007 season vulnerable yet none of the approximately 25 multiyear contracts that players have signed over the past several weeks acknowledge that vulnerability some examples paul konerko \( white sox \) signed a 60 million contract with a salary of 12 million a year billy wagner \( mets \) signed a 43 million contract that will pay him a salary of 105 million a year brian giles \( padres \) has a salary of 9 million a year for three years , 2006 through 2008 rafael furcal \( dodgers \) will make 13 million in 2007 , and also in 2008 a j burnett \( blue jays \) will make 12 million in 2007 and the same salary each of the three years after that if there is a theme in these and other negotiations , it is that player agents are clearly optimistic that the owners and the union will negotiate a new contract in the same spirit and with the same success that they achieved peace in 2002 other thoughts were expressed by player agents in an informal survey , including the view that the commissioner s office crushed the union in the talks for a stronger steroids testing program and held the upper hand for future talks in that dispute , however , commissioner bud selig was negotiating from strength because he had the 800pound gorilla congress on his side the union knew if it did n't agree to selig s proposal , congress would move to enact legislation that would be even worse for the players in negotiations for a new collectivebargaining agreement , the owners will be on their own they will not have congress running interference nevertheless , economic conditions are so good for both sides that people on both sides feel they should be able to negotiate a new agreement without a strike or a lockout one agent , tommy tanzer , seemed particularly optimistic about the chances for a reasonably easy and early settlement they 're selling the international baseball thing so hard , tanzer said , referring to the world baseball classic , which will be held for the first time in march and on which the union and the commissioner s office are cooperating they 're enthusiastic about it i just do n't believe there will be a work stoppage i do n't see it this time tanzer represents scott eyre , a relief pitcher who signed a contract with the chicago cubs that will pay him 35 million in the second year , 2007 , or 800 , 000 more than his salary in 2006 adam katz , who negotiated furcal s contract , said the possibility of a work stoppage just has n't been raised as a deal point or a matter of discussion in my dealings barry meister , who negotiated reliever kyle farnsworth s contract with the yankees , said , based on the climate , it s nothing that makes me alarmed bean stringfellow , wagner s agent , said he thought about seeking a lower 2007 salary but added , we did not want that to happen ninety percent of the contracts i 've seen do n't have a lower salary in '07 , he said darek braunecker , burnett s agent , said of a lower 2007 salary it was something we gave consideration to and we attempted to do but it was something we gave up in exchange for something else it was a tradeoff for the way the money came out in a bonus in the first year joe bick , giles s agent , said he might seek a lower 2007 salary in some deals , but for giles , he said , i talked to our tax guys about it , and we did n't feel that in the final analysis it made that much of a difference sometimes the commissioner s office alerts clubs to certain aspects of negotiations , but rob manfred , the clubs' chief labor executive , said , we have not made a big issue out of 2007 michael weiner , the union s general counsel , said the structure of new longterm contracts was not discussed at the union s meetings with agents last month they obviously know when the agreement expires and when there could be a work stoppage , he said maybe we made an error not focusing on that it will be an error only if players do n't get their entire salaries in 2007

ulan bator , mongolia , nov 21 if you are an american president in need of just a few hours of temporary political asylum no debate about iraq , no chinese leaders resisting the american agenda and plenty of adulation here is an approach come to the endless steppes that ghengis khan made famous when air force one descended low over the barren but breathtaking landscape here , few mongolians had ever seen anything like it none of the previous american presidents had made the journey while in office and so mongolians came into this tattered postsoviet capital , past what will soon be a monument celebrating the spectacular victories eight centuries ago , when the mongol empire stretched from the yellow sea to baghdad , to hear george w bush tell them that today , mongolia and the united states are standing together as brothers in the cause of freedom if it was gratifying for mongolians to hear that message from the leader of a country that billboards here proclaimed a third neighbor not russia and not china their reaction was probably even more gratifying for president bush at home , there may be questions about the war in iraq , but there are not many here mongolia recently sent its fifth rotation of troops to iraq it sends roughly 160 at a time in truth , there were four protesters as mr bush bumped past the belching industrial complexes outside ulan bator two held a sign urging him to get out of iraq two wanted him to sign the kyoto protocol on climate change \( for the record , mongolia signed \) antiamericanism \? i have n't heard any , said brett burkhart , a peace corps volunteer from california who has been living in a ger a traditional mongolian domed tent in a rural village well , i did hear it once , but i think the guy was drunk there is something else that seemed to thrill mr bush about mongolia presidential entertainment is vivid as his limousine raced across the steppe , a team of mongolian warriors carrying spears and shields and wearing the body armor that ghengis khan used to subdue territory that mr bush is still grappling with 800 years later suddenly appeared and galloped alongside gone from mr bush s face was the let sgetonwithit look he had at gigkakuji , the famed temple he visited in kyoto , japan he talked with the warriors and stepped around camels and yaks to make his way into a quite luxurious ger sitting by a woodburning stove , he chatted with a family of herders \( the mongolian government says the herders were the real thing , but they live 100 miles out of town , and were brought in to lend some authenticity to the small village erected for mr bush s benefit \) the president sipped a bit of fermented mare s milk , nibbled on some cheese curd and listened to some throat singing the man who once powerwalked through red square in less than 10 minutes actually lingered then , reluctantly , four and a half hours after he landed , mr bush boarded his plane and lifted off taking him back to the questions at home about how his presidency can regain its footing amid new debates on the iraq war iraq , every day , everywhere if mongolia won its way into mr bush s heart with its unflagging support for the war in iraq , its attitude was the exception on his fourday trip the war is deeply unpopular in japan , his first stop , and his motorcade did not exactly attract huge crowds things were worse in south korea , where the defense minister announced , as a fact , that south korea planned to trim its more than 3 , 000 troops in iraq by a third next year mr bush s aides scrambled to win a retraction the president s national security adviser , stephen j hadley , called the south korean foreign minister and was reassured , he said , of the country s commitment to the mission the number of south korean troops , mr hadley told reporters , will depend on the political evolution and the security evolution apparently , that evolution happened quickly on monday , 48 hours after mr bush left south korean soil , the country s cabinet approved the reduction of forces next year then came the chinese , with their highly attuned sense of political leverage it is impossible to say exactly what led president hu jintao to conclude that he would not pay a high price for making vague commitments on revaluing china s currency and for offering no commitments on improving human rights or increasing the pace of democratization administration officials were clearly surprised that not only did china fail to release any dissidents on a list of human rights cases turned over to mr hu in september , but it also detained more dissidents just before mr bush s arrival administration officials also seemed vexed that mr bush s statements in china were largely unheard by most of the nation so perhaps it was no surprise that aides traveling with mr bush were striving to note some accomplishments talks with china are about longterm problems , they said , adding that mr hadley had warned before the trip that the president was not seeking immediate deliverables , apparently referring to specific diplomatic and economic achievements and secretary of state condoleezza rice said that china s willingness to listen to talk about human rights issues was significant i can remember times in the past where , both here and in a number of other countries , you were just told to mind your own business , she said when she met with reporters in beijing on sunday well , that s not the case now for bush , no horse of any color president bush may love texas , and his ranch , as he reminded mongolians when he compared their land to his beloved state but his enthusiasm does not extend to another mongolian passion horses when defense secretary donald h rumsfeld was here a month ago , the mongolians presented him with their highest honor a beautiful gelding that he named montana so in a delicate act of diplomacy , the white house secured an agreement that president enkhbayar nambar would not give mr bush a horse but since the secretary of defense had to look his gift in the mouth leaving it here , at least temporarily , because it was a bit difficult to transport on his official plane mr bush found another way to saddle up i'm here on an important international mission , mr bush said at the opening of his speech in government house secretary rumsfeld asked me to check on his horse
when carrie beth walsh and her two toddlers landed at the airport in seoul , south korea , last year , there was no sign of her husband , an army pilot who had been transferred there six weeks earlier he eventually showed up in a taxi , broke and unprepared for his family s arrival no rental car for the drive to his base , no apartment , no credit cards in his wallet that were not already up against his loan limits he was making more than 60 , 000 a year , ms walsh said but we were always broke she soon learned why her husband , warrant officer aaron w walsh , had pumped more than 20 , 000 into the army s own slot machines on bases in south korea last month , his marriage and career shattered , mr walsh , who is 33 , resigned from the army to avoid a courtmartial on desertion charges stemming from his gambling habit military gambling is a big business about 2 billion flows through militaryowned slot machines at officers' clubs , activities centers and bowling alleys on overseas bases each year most flows back out as jackpots , but 6 percent remains with the house , about the same ratio as in las vegas each year , the armed forces take in more than 120 million from onbase slot machines and 7 million from army bingo games at home these funds help pay for recreational programs for the troops but even military researchers have acknowledged that the armed forces are heavily populated by people who , like aaron walsh , may be especially vulnerable to gambling addiction athletic , risktaking young people who are experiencing severe stress and anxiety and wartime is an environment that is probably creating more vulnerability than usual , said christine reilly , executive director of the gambling addiction research institute at cambridge health alliance , a teaching institution for the harvard medical school more than four years ago , congress ordered the pentagon to study how onbase slot machines were affecting military families the pentagon initially hired pricewaterhousecoopers to do the study , but it ended the contract after a few months and completed the study itself the final report provided no new data about the rate of problem gambling but it did caution congress that the military could not maintain many popular programs , like golf courses and family activity centers , without slot machine revenue or a significant new source of cash one consultant who worked with pricewaterhousecoopers was rachel volberg , a medical sociologist who runs gemini resources , which measures gambling rates around the world we met a great deal of defensiveness , both in washington and on base , she said everyone was very concerned that those revenues might go away she added only the chaplains took this really seriously they told us that one out of three people who come to them for counseling have a problem with gambling , but ca n't tell anyone because they will be dishonorably discharged slot machines are a very profitable operation , said peter isaacs , the chief operating officer of the army s community and family support center , which runs the largest slot machine program but we do not operate them strictly to extract profit our soldiers have told us they want access to the same games and gambling opportunities available to the civilians they are defending the military is very passive in our advertising , and we have low maximum jackpots , mr isaacs continued we do n't want to encourage people to blow the rent money chasing a 1 million payout he added , the vast majority of the troops use the machines responsibly despite research showing that service members are at least as vulnerable to compulsive gambling as civilians even more vulnerable , some research suggests the military spends little of its congressional funding , and none of its gambling profits , on treatment for those whose gambling gets out of control the pricewaterhousecoopers report to the pentagon noted a general lack of accessible treatment for gambling addiction , but that warning was not included in the pentagon s final report to congress it was echoed , however , in a littlenoticed research paper written by a team of navy and marine corps medical personnel last year , describing a gambling addiction program they started in okinawa in january 2003 the fact that few treatment options exist for military personnel , their family members and other personnel at overseas bases is not disputed , the paper said prior to the start of the present program in okinawa , no formal overseas treatment options for pathological gambling existed the okinawa program treated 35 patients in 2003 most cited slot machines as their primary form of gambling , although five said they spent significant time playing bingo as well seven of them , or 20 percent , said they had considered suicide although its leaders called the okinawa program quite promising , it no longer exists , according to a navy spokesman indeed , across the services , there is only one program that provides the preferred inpatient treatment for gambling addiction , at camp pendleton in oceanside , calif the center handles about 25 cases a year a few bases , including nellis air force base in las vegas , rely on nearby veterans' hospitals or local gamblers anonymous chapters but on most military bases , the search for treatment can be frustrating and futile maj tami dillahunt , a military lawyer at camp casey in south korea , recently defended pvt andrew foster , a former chaplain s assistant , who was convicted of stealing money to gamble he tried to get help , major dillahunt said he went to army community services they said they could n't help and sent him to mental health services there , they said , 'no , we ca n't help you go to your chaplain' so he goes to his chaplain , who says he s not qualified to help with addiction and refers him to army community services it was a total runaround a senior legal officer also tried unsuccessfully to find treatment for private foster , major dillahunt said private foster wants treatment he knows if he does n't get help , he will return to gambling , she added it just is not available mike catanzaro , who runs the camp pendleton program , acknowledged that many commands have never heard of us and that little other treatment is available one of the major obstacles is that there is no policy or mandate to treat pathological gambling in the military , just as in the civilian community , he said slot machines have been a fixture of military life for decades they were banned from domestic military bases in 1951 , after a series of scandals they were removed from army and air force bases in 1972 , after more than a dozen people were courtmartialed for skimming cash from slot machines in southeast asia during the vietnam war but 1 , 500 machines remained on navy and marine corps bases overseas after that scandal , and in 1980 , the army and air force started to restore the machines at many of their overseas bases the marine corps and navy slot machine programs are now run by the army the air force still runs its own program today , there are approximately 4 , 150 modern video slot machines at military bases in nine countries , according to mr isaacs and an air force spokesman the army bingo program , too , has a few small skeletons in its closet in the 1990 s , some bases outsourced their bingo games to private companies , which would bus in civilian players and share the profits withthe base after some local officials complained that the games violated state gambling laws , the pentagon barred outsourcing and restricted bingo to onbase personnel and their bona fide guests but while army bingo operations are modest , they are twice as profitable as slot machines and produce an annual profit of about 7 million on revenue of about 45 million sixty percent of those bingo programs are small , but 11 of them collect average monthly revenue of more than 100 , 000 those include games at some of the giant bases deploying troops to iraq fort bragg in north carolina , fort benning in georgia and fort hood in texas some larger programs are beginning to embrace the new technology that is transforming bingo from a parlor game into a highspeed contest played on terminals that increasingly resemble slot machines by reducing labor costs , this technology makes the programs more efficient and profitable , according to robert glotfelty , a senior program analyst at the army s community and family service center that is worrisome to some gambling experts because , they said , there is some evidence that faster play is more addictive for vulnerable players the military s best guess about how many service members are vulnerable comes from the pentagon s survey of health related behaviors among military personnel , conducted departmentwide every two to three years the october 2003 survey showed that about 12 percent of all service members , or about 17 , 500 people , had reported five or more gambling problems over their lifetime , an indication of probable pathological gambling that roughly matches the rate for the civilian population but a number of gambling specialists say the survey may substantially understate the problem , and not just because of the demographics of the military population the methodology in the surveys is out of date in a big way , ms volberg said top military officials say they have no gambling problem , she said but they have n't measured it in a way that s comparable to the way rates are measured in the civilian population moreover , selfreporting surveys are poor tools for measuring behavior , like excessive gambling , that are essentially criminalized in the military culture , said keith whyte , executive director of the national council on problem gambling in arlington , va so private foster , whose career is hanging by a thread , is serving out a sixmonth sentence in south korea without treatment , major dillahunt said he s said he hoped to be sent to iraq when he gets out , because there is no gambling there , she said mr walsh , the helicopter pilot , was luckier he was sent to camp pendleton for treatment after his wife discovered the program on the internet no one in korea had ever heard of it , she said like 90 percent of all gambling addicts , mr walsh washed out of his first try at treatment he drove from the clinic to las vegas , overstayed his leave and lost 18 , 000 before being arrested and sent back to korea by then , his wife had returned to her home in maine to obtain a divorce his view is that slot machines should be removed from military bases the military s explanation that slot machines are a recreational opportunity for the troops is a bunch of bunk , he said it does n't have anything to do with 'recreational opportunities' it has everything to do with the money after his forced resignation , mr walsh flew home and went directly to las vegas interviewed on a collect call from a pay phone there , mr walsh said that he has now lost 10 , 700 , the last of his savings for nine days i 've been sleeping on the streets , he said i'm not sure what i'm going to do most nights , i think about ending it all
for a country renowned in the age of exploration for its seafaring adventures and colonies , portugal has lived much of its wineproducing life in splendid isolation there is port , of course , made from grapes grown along the douro river , and madeira from the island of madeira you would be surprised at how many people think of these fortified wines as british rather than portuguese , and with reason the british pretty much invented port and have dominated its shipping , though france and the united states are now the biggest port markets for years , if people thought at all of portuguese wines , they thought of mateus and lancer s , cheap sparkling ros s known for producing monumental hangovers , which were as much a rite of passage for a certain age group as buying that first jimi hendrix record or claiming to have been at woodstock for most of the 20th century , the portuguese themselves were making and drinking indifferent wines very few went out into the rest of the world , for which we can be grateful , because they were n't very good but after portugal joined what was then the european community in 1986 , the wine industry fundamentally remade itself , replacing outdated equipment , modernizing winemaking methods and improving viticultural techniques today , portugal is a source for distinctive wines that can be very good values , and some of the best portuguese red wines , as the dining section s wine panel learned , are coming from the douro , the area best known as the home of port we tasted 25 dry red wines from the douro , a rugged mountainous region that stretches from the center of portugal s northern tier east to the spanish border florence fabricant and i were joined by phil pratt , wine director at 21 club in manhattan , and ernani l silva , wine director at trotters in white plains our immediate reaction was how widely these wines ranged stylistically some were simple and grapy , while others were earthy and , as mr pratt put it , savage i think he meant it as a compliment some were easy to enjoy immediately , while others were tannic , perhaps savagely so , and required aging as a general rule , mr silva said , these would benefit from decanting more than anything , these wines struck me as honest they did not try to imitate flavors and styles that are popular elsewhere they are not what marketers call fruit forward , essentially one step removed from soft drinks nor were they rustic and simple they were decidedly old world in style , with tannins , mineral flavors and good acidity , excellent with food but not wines for people milling around in a banquet hall what makes these wines so distinctive \? look no further than the grapes not a cabernet , merlot or syrah among them the portuguese have stubbornly stuck with their indigenous grapes , which in the douro means names like tinta roriz \( known in spain as tempranillo \) , touriga nacional , tinta barroca , tinto c o and touriga franca if these names spark a glimmer of recognition it is because they are the principal grapes of port touriga nacional is widely regarded as the best and most distinctive of these grapes , producing a wine of great power and personality that has been likened to cabernet but singlegrape wines are the exception most are blends of some or all of these grapes , and each has its role to play tinto c o can add a fine floral perfume , while touriga franca adds a more exotic quality our top wine , the 2001 quinta do vale me o , had all five grapes in its blend , and perhaps that accounted for the complexity of its aromas and flavors yet the wine offered more than complexity it showed intensity and precision , the mark of a great wine it cost 55 indeed , four of our top 10 wines were 55 to 60 , and if that seems expensive , consider how many mediocre california cabernets , burgundies or brunello di montalcinos can be had for the same price without complaint while douro reds are beginning to attract attention , they have not yet gained widespread popularity , so many retail shops may still have older vintages because nobody has bought the wines for that reason , because we buy all our wines in retail shops , we were able to taste a 1998 vinha do fojo from quinta do fojo , which was powerful and tannic yet still somewhat elegant , with flavors of menthol and dried fruit , and a 1997 quinta da gaivosa , a much softer , less structured wine with plenty of lush fruit alfama , a greenwich village restaurant with an excellent portuguese wine selection , offers both , but from the 1999 vintage our best value was a 12 2000 reserva from sogrape , one of portugal s biggest producers , which makes wines from all over the country i 've always found the wines to be pretty good and excellent values , and this wellbalanced wine , with dense fruit and complexity , was no exception by contrast , the 60 2001 pintas from wine soul , is in a different league , with tough tannins that ought to soften over time , spicy , earthy aromas and lots of fruit ms fabricant called it sophisticated that term was previously reserved for port , but no doubt we 'll be seeing it applied more and more to portuguese table wines aside from port companies that have increasingly gone into the table wine business , winemakers from france , italy and germany have all taken a bead on portugal as the next big thing with continued progress in winemaking , and further research on cultivation of the distinctive portuguese grapes , it s likely that portugal will really hit its stride in the next few years pretty soon , we 'll be remembering those 60 bottles as remnants of a more innocent age tasting report moving beyond memories of mateus quinta do vale me o 2001 55 1 2 rating three and a half

to appreciate how far eating has evolved from a matter of survival to a statement of values , take a trip to cookshop and a look at its chalkboards they do n't list daily specials they celebrate the restaurant s favorite farmers , an honor roll of principled stewards and good shepherds who are n't exhausting their land , immobilizing their livestock , tweaking genes or toying with hormones along with an elite fleet of chosen fishermen , these farmers stock cookshop s larder , and they are more or less local , or at least regional the governing religion demands it on a given night the number of them on those boards may rise as high as 10 , just like the commandments cookshop , you see , is selling more than montauk squid , catskill duck and a cornucopia of lettuces , legumes , root vegetables and fruits that dutifully obey their seasons cookshop is selling virtue , and it s suffused with it , even in ways that are n't bluntly advertised the tables , for example , are made of a type of american oak that cookshop s proprietors chose over less expensive alternatives because those alternatives come from endangered forests the menus , tawny and matte , use recycled paper so you can sip , sup and simultaneously congratulate yourself , all of which might be a bit much but for this you can also have a merry , heedless time with the exception of those chalkboards , cookshop renders its call to conscience as a murmur , audible to anyone soothed by the sound and ignorable by those who just want to chow down more important , cookshop s theology incorporates the pleasure principle never mind the wood the tables are well spaced throughout an lshaped room with a long wall of windows , a magnanimous level of lighting and a d cor that perfectly splits the difference between spare and cozy the seafood , meat and produce are n't just ethical they 're fresh and flavorful and while the dishes , individually and all together , strive for a quality that might well be called wholesomeness , it s a hedonistic \( as opposed to an extracrunchy \) wholesomeness , built around an allamerican , oldfashioned emphasis on bellyfilling comfort that brings to mind prune and little giant they and cookshop are the deviledegg restaurants all three have served that dish , which is listed on their menus among snacks , a category separate from appetizers and in all three cases the dish is part of a studied homeyness that also manifests itself in housemade sausages and liverladen treats but the deviled eggs at cookshop are topped with caviar \( from american paddlefish , mind you \) , signaling something else cookshop is a more ambitious production than its kinfolk it s also more polished and , with about 115 seats , much larger the producers are the husbandwife team of marc meyer and vicki freeman and their partner , chris paraskevaides , who also collaborate on five points in noho mr meyer is the executive chef five points opened in 1999 and has done brisk business ever since it s never exciting but frequently satisfying , while cookshop is rarely exciting but almost always satisfying a child that improves upon the parent it presents a balanced userfriendly menu that offers something for everyone \( a meatless woodoven pizza , a meatless pasta , halibut in a shower of olives and raisins , beef brisket in a swamp of grits and fried onions \) without collapsing into incoherence the food is amply portioned , fairly priced and completely sophisticated but not remotely fussy the wine list is extensive and varied but not showy because cookshop has made the rounds of small producers , acquiring wines that are n't easy to find in retail stores , you can spend 30 to 40 and get an interesting , hugely enjoyable bottle try the 2002 mas des chim res from languedoc , made primarily of syrah none of those strengths may sound like a big deal , but it s surprising how few restaurants combine them , how seldom i hear what i often did when i went to cookshop friends remarking that they would gladly return on their own time and dime they most often said this as we sampled cookshop s irresistible desserts , the work of the pastry chef , heather miller there was a singleserving chocolate meringue pie , which had stiff competition from a maple flan with warm gingerbread and from a hot fudge sundae with pecans , bourbonspiked butterscotch and more there was also , for the faint of stomach , a fantastic mix of gingerlemon ice and cranberries , which sat on the table among its less restrained peers like a merchantivory film in a festival of tarantino the savory highlights at cookshop include an appetizer of housesmoked bluefish that s as fine a treatment of a blue as you 're likely to encounter you ca n't go wrong with any of the salads , one of which liberates beets from goat cheese and pairs them instead with tahini you also ca n't go wrong with cookshop s grits , and that s fortunate , because they appear not only with the brisket but also with roasted shrimp and fried duck livers , and on their own , as a side among the snacks , the deviled egg is not as good a bet as saut ed chanterelle , oyster and maitake mushrooms on grilled rye toast , or as slices of smoked pork tenderloin with persimmon mr meyer clearly knows his way around a pig , because the best of the entrees is probably the pork , which pairs grilled loin with a pudgy link of sausage it reflects mr meyer s attempt to use as many parts of the animals he buys as possible he cooks whole young chickens and rabbits on an experimental , oddlooking vertical rotisserie that he helped design , but he seemingly has n't mastered this equipment or dealt adequately with its collateral effects both times i had the chicken , its skin was n't crisp , and the one time i sat near the open kitchen the heat from that rotisserie made me feel as if i should be wearing spf 45 i'm betting mr meyer and his partners will solve those problems , because their eagerness to please seems as keen as their exaltation of all things seasonal , freerange and linecaught of course these impulses are not contradictory , and cookshop is proof a place where eating well and doing

madison avenue is increasingly interested in using everyday women in advertising instead of just waifish supermodels the change comes after the dove line of personalcare products sold by unilever introduced what it called a campaign for real beauty , which presents women in advertisements as they are rather than as some believe they ought to be if the fad becomes a trend and shows legs , so to speak , it has the potential to fundamentally change decades of imagemaking on madison avenue but that is a big if indeed there have been many previous instances of ads that showed socalled real women in place of professional models , which receded as the allure of glamour again reared its beautiful head this week , nike is introducing a humorous print and online campaign for exercise gear , frankly glorifying body parts that until now were almost never seen in ads , much less celebrated one ad , which begins boldly , my butt is big , features an oversize photograph of the derri re in question another nike ad declares , i have thunder thighs , while a third asserts my shoulders are n't dainty or proportional to my hips some say they are like a man s i say , leave men out of it the nike ads , by wieden kennedy in portland , ore , are arriving days after the chicken of the sea brand of tuna introduced a television commercial showing a gorgeous young woman being ogled by the men in her office she can escape their wolfish ways only in the elevator , which she enters alone , then breathes a sigh of relief revealing that she really has a morethanample stomach , which she had been holding in the nike campaign was in the works , executives say , well before the muchpublicized arrival last month of dove print and outdoor ads showing six women , none of them models , sizes 4 to 12 , smiling in their underwear \( the first of the dove real beauty ads , showing older , wrinkled women , started appearing last fall \) the chicken of the sea commercial is adapted from a spot that its parent , thai union frozen products , began running in asia in 2001 even so , the arrival of all the ads at the same time suggests that change may be in the air we 've gotten tired of airbrushed pictures none of us can relate to or recognize , said linda kaplan thaler , one of the most prominent women in advertising , whose agency , the kaplan thaler group in new york , was not involved in creating any of the campaigns advertisers are loosening the reins , said ms kaplan thaler , who is chief executive and chief creative officer at her agency , which is owned by the publicis groupe , in recognition of the reality that women are the majority of consumers and are buying most of the products but those facts have been evident for years why the new style of ads now \? one reason , said nathan coyle , senior strategist at brain reserve in new york , a consulting company , is the advent of reality television your neighbors , everyday people , are the new celebrities , mr coyle said , which feeds the desire for marketers to shift from depicting women who are unattainable to women who are attainable kelly simmons , president of a brand consulting company in philadelphia named bubble , offered another reason the aging of the babyboom generation the 76 million americans born from 1946 to 1964 who have long set the pace for marketers and advertising agencies the first baby boomers will start turning 60 on jan 1 there s no question baby boomers feel better about their bodies , ms simmons said , and are determined to age beautifully , adding , it feels there are real voices of women coming through in the dove and nike ads i applaud the trend nancy monsarrat , united states director for advertising at nike in beaverton , ore , said that in addition to the different attitudes about body image among boomer women , younger women have a different perspective from that of their counterparts a decade or two ago they 're more personally independent about who they can and should be , ms monsarrat said , which is also reflected in the campaign s approach one of the things we 've noticed is if you go to an exercise class , if you go to a marathon , active women come in a lot of shapes and sizes , she added this can be a great celebration of that fitness and health are also the focus of the chicken of the sea commercial , said john signorino , the company s president and chief executive , in san diego he imported the spot to the united states after consumers including , he said , his wife received overseas versions of it from friends by email it s an effort to show consumers , in an attentiongetting way , that tuna , and chicken of the sea , fit into a healthy lifestyle , mr signorino said the commercial is being shown , or soon will be , on networks like abc , cbs , hgtv and oxygen , he added , and will be circulated through email the spot is adapted from the original version created by an agency in bangkok named chaiyo ms monsarrat said the nike campaign , which is also scheduled to appear on a web site \( www nikewomen com \) , is in keeping with her company s efforts , dating back more than a decade , to address issues about women s selfimages in a positive way , without stereotypes she cited campaigns that carried themes like this is not a goddess and if you let me play , all of which were intended , she said , to be honest in how we communicate with our target consumer nike was not alone in the 1990 s in running ads meant to question the conventional wisdom about images of women in advertising in 1997 , the body shop gained international attention for a campaign carrying the theme love your body , which featured a rubenesque plastic doll named ruby the print ads and posters showed the voluptuous , even zaftig , ruby reclining on a sofa under this headline there are 3 billion women who do n't look like supermodels and only 8 who do and since 1997 , the advertising women of new york club has presented awards to campaigns that its members deem to be breaking ground by portraying women in realistic , nonstereotypical ways in addition to nike , winners of such awards have included adidas , avon , gatorade , john hancock and reebok the waxing and waning of socalled real women in advertising comes as marketers and agencies embrace the idea , then revert to traditional images when they believe it is time for a new direction as consumers lose interest advertising sometimes starts trends and sometimes it follows trends , ms kaplan thaler said even if they do not turn up in ads , real women have always been here , are here and continue to be here , she added i'm always happy to see advertising that does not dictate a norm none of us can achieve still , said ms simmons of bubble , who studies sex issues in marketing , more remains to be done before the stereotypes are banished the emphasis is still on women s bodies in the new ads , ms simmons said it s not like we 're looking at their irises

paris , jan 9 for the french , culture is culture and commerce is commerce , and the twain should ne'er meet that at least is the theory in practice , because culture here requires even more money than the government provides , french museums charge admission , operate gift shops and woo corporate sponsors and now two of them , the louvre and the georges pompidou center , are going still further they are preparing to open branches outside paris so , are french museums following the international branding route chartered by new york s empirebuilding solomon r guggenheim museum , which not only created the acclaimed guggenheim bilbao in spain in 1997 , but also has outposts in venice , berlin and las vegas and is looking to plant its flag in brazil , mexico , taiwan and hong kong \? up to a point the louvre is to open a 100 million satellite in the northern french city of lens , near lille , in 2009 and will occupy a new annex at the high museum of art in atlanta for three years from 2006 still , the louvre s director , henri loyrette , has said he considers britain s tate to be a closer role model than the guggenheim the tate , founded a century ago on london s millbank , now runs three other museums in britain , but it has no permanent presence abroad in contrast , while the pompidou will inaugurate a new 68 million branch in the northeastern french city of metz in 2007 it is also looking beyond france it aspires to run a new museum of modern art in hong kong , part of a proposed development known as the west kowloon cultural district and there , the pompidou finds itself alongside the guggenheim , which has also signed up with one of three groups bidding for the west kowloon contract so why are western museums flapping their wings so energetically \? throughout the 19th century , museums displayed art and antiquities from faroff lands to people who did not travel but today , with tourists representing around half the visitors to leading european museums , the issue is less how to draw crowds than what to do with tens of thousands of artworks that never go on display the opening of outposts , then , eases this problem the tate led the way with a liverpool branch in 1988 st ives in 1993 and tate modern in london in 2000 in 1999 the nagoya boston museum of fine arts opened in nagoya , japan , to show works from the boston collection the rodin museum in paris will soon rotate sculptures through the new museu rodin in salvador , brazil and since 2002 , the rijksmuseum in amsterdam has run a small gallery at nearby schiphol airport to draw attention to itself other museums , the guggenheim among them , see foreign branches as sources of revenue the state hermitage museum of st petersburg , russia , has shown particular enterprise in october 2000 the hermitage rooms in somerset house in london opened with the treasures of catherine the great a year later the hermitage created an exhibition center at the venetian resorthotelcasino complex in las vegas in collaboration with the guggenheim foundation \( the guggenheim las vegas , a larger gallery that opened at the same time , has since closed \) and last year , a still more ambitious hermitage followed in amsterdam good for the hermitage s image , no doubt , and a nice deal too the museum bore none of the cost of adapting these spaces for its rotating exhibitions although 48 million was spent on renovating two 17thcentury buildings in amsterdam alone but the hermitage nonetheless takes a 15 percent share of entrance fees , money it is channeling toward restoration and conservation of its collection and winter palace headquarters money is also a variable in the louvre s agreement with the high museum in atlanta , although mr loyrette is circumspect he says he wants longterm projects with american regional museums because you can do things in research and education that are not possible with oneshot exhibitions in this case , three successive 10month exhibitions on the history of the louvre will be accompanied by smaller shows of works from its collection thanks to american corporate and private sponsors of this extended visit , however , the louvre also hopes to receive revenues that will cover half the 20 million cost of renovating the 18thcentury french furniture gallery at its paris headquarters with lens \( prounounced lahnsse \) , the louvre s main motivation is to share its vast collection , with the plus that the new museum will be built with city , regional and european funds but mr loyrette sees this decentralization bringing other advantages it will take place in a city without any important cultural institution , he explained putting the lens museum into a new building will alter the louvre s image and it offers us a chance to rethink our collection the pompidou also plans to show its collection and organize temporary exhibitions at its new museum in metz , a city that will soon be linked to paris by highspeed train and is also well placed to draw visitors from neighboring germany , luxembourg and belgium of the 55 , 000 works in the pompidou s collection , bruno racine , the center s president , recently noted , only around 1 , 300 are on show in paris at any time while both the lens and metz museums will be run from paris , the louvre and the pompidou are eager to use eyecatching contemporary design to give them a separate identity work is already under way on the pompidoumetz , a striking design by the japanese architect shigeru ban , jean de gastines of france and philip gumuchdjian of london and a much anticipated architectural competition for the louvrelens will be held this year in this , the french museums are clearly bowing to frank gehry s guggenheim bilbao , which has demonstrated the power of architecture to transform a city s image and iconic architecture remains central to the guggenheim s strategy its planned museum in rio de janeiro is the work of france s jean nouvel , while zaha hadid has designed the museum proposed for taichung , taiwan because building costs must be paid locally , however , both projects are being held up in the courts in rio and the municipal council in taichung the guggenheim is also looking to build a landmark museum in guadalajara , mexico , but still has to pick a design for the 100acre west kowloon cultural district , however , the hong kong government has already chosen norman foster s master plan , which includes a great canopy to embrace theaters , concert halls and four museums , including one for modern art whether other architects will design the institutions beneath the canopy is unclear and whether the guggenheim or the pompidou or both will ever operate any museum in hong kong is also still up in the air they have joined forces with dynamic star international , but two other consortiums have held talks with the museum of modern art in new york and the victoria and albert museum meanwhile , opposition is mounting in hong kong to giving a lucrative 5 billion project to a single developer in fact , even if dynamic star is chosen , it may still come down to a choice between the guggenheim and the pompidou the guggenheim can boast greater international experience , but the pompidou has the richer modern collection both promise to share their temporary exhibitions with hong kong and to promote contemporary chinese art , but here the pompidou may have the edge because it organized a major china show in paris last year so perhaps politics will have the last word after all , the very notion of implanting western museums around the world is political in this case , would hong kong prefer an american or a french cultural beachhead \? on the other hand , if it wants to be truly mischievous , the city might just ask the guggenheim and the pompidou to run the new museum together now that would make for interesting cultural politics
the bush administration s efforts to capitalize on the recent discovery of the ivorybilled woodpecker were bizarre gale norton , the interior secretary , announced a 10 million program to enlarge the bird s habitat , proclaiming that second chances to save wildlife once thought to be extinct are rare but what about first chances \? the woodpecker , if it indeed has returned , is as much warning as gift president bush s policies suggest that he not only has failed to learn from past mistakes , but is determined to repeat them on a more destructive scale the obvious example is his fixation on opening the arctic national wildlife refuge to oil drilling this bespeaks an intellectually bankrupt energy policy and would certainly cause trouble for wildlife yet the arctic is hardly the only illustration of the administration s insensitivity to wilderness values here are three more of recent vintage roadless rollback on thursday , the administration repealed one of president bill clinton s proudest and most popular environmental initiatives , a rule that placed nearly 60 million acres , or roughly onethird , of the national forests off limits to new road building and development the clinton rule gave protection to some of the last truly wild places in america and the fish and wildlife that live there by the forest service s own estimates , these roadless areas shelter at least 200 rare species , which under the administration s less protective regime will now be more vulnerable to commercial development the rollback also completes the administration s demolition job on the web of forest protections it inherited from mr clinton drill , drill , drill meanwhile , the interior department continues to move at warp speed to lease everlarger chunks of the rocky mountains to oil and gas companies at least one governor has had enough last month , bill richardson of new mexico filed a suit against a bureau of land management leasing plan that he says would leave 95 percent of the 18 millionacre otero mesa open to drilling at risk are some of the most important and fragile grasslands left in america , the wildlife they sustain and of special concern to mr richardson an aquifer that contains the state s largest untapped source of fresh water the lawsuit is being closely watched by other western governors , in particular wyoming s dave freudenthal , who is appalled by the pace and volume of the drilling activity in wyoming s upper green river valley it is not as if the oil and gas companies have no place else to go fully 85 percent of the petroleum resources on federal lands in the five rocky mountain states are already leased or available for leasing moreover , by its own admission , the industry has neither the equipment nor the manpower to exploit the leases it already owns yet another reason to ask why the administration finds it necessary to accelerate drilling in places where moderation is required and to invite new drilling in places where there should be none at all shortchanging nature mr bush s environmental agenda in the 2000 campaign consisted of three promises , none realized one was to regulate global warming emissions another was to eliminate the maintenance backlog in the national parks and the third was to fully fund the land and water conservation fund , the government s main program for creating and preserving parks and wildlife refuges the program s authorized level is 900 million , half for federal open space purchases , half for state acquisitions mr bush has n't come close this year he asked for 130 million for federal purchases , nothing for the states last week a house subcommittee axed the federal funds altogether the irony that mr bush may be presiding over the death of precisely the kind of program that the ivorybilled woodpeckers of this world depend on seemed lost on mr bush s senior officials , who uttered nary a peep of protest
washington , nov 30 as a lawyer in the reagan justice department , the supreme court nominee samuel a alito jr played an integral role in devising legal strategy to pare back the landmark abortion rights case roe v wade , documents disclosed wednesday show judge alito argued in a 1985 memorandum to the reagan administration s solicitor general that two pending supreme court cases were an opportunity to advance the goals of overruling roe v wade and , in the meantime , of mitigating its effects and in a strongly worded 17page legal analysis , he recommended advancing the administration s ultimate case against roe by defending state regulations requiring doctors to provide women seeking abortions with information about fetal development , the risks and unforeseeable detrimental effects of the procedure and the availability of adoption services or paternal child support although the information might cause emotional distress , anxiety , guilt and in some cases physical pain to the women , judge alito wrote , such results are part of the responsibility of moral choice , comparable to the feelings of a legislator voting on abortion legislation , a judge or juror pronouncing a sentence of death or imprisonment , or a military officer commanding a mission he knows will cost lives the memorandum substantiates recently disclosed statements judge alito made about his pride in contributing to the administration s efforts to end the constitutional right to abortion he made those statements in a reagan administration job application written a few months after the memorandum it also illustrates judge alito s personal passion in opposing abortion rights and the formative role he played in the administration s approach to the cases the reagan administration s solicitor general , charles fried , sent copies of judge alito s memorandum to several others in the justice department for discussion i need hardly say how sensitive this material is , and ask that it have no wider circulation , mr fried wrote on the cover sheet when the administration weighed in on one of the cases , thornburgh v american college of obstetricians and gynecologists , mr fried incorporated some of judge alito s arguments in the government s brief but where judge alito sought to avoid a frontal assault on roe v wade that he thought risked rejection , mr fried decided to take it on directly judge alito s name does not appear on the brief in an interview wednesday , mr fried said judge alito had helped write part of the brief , although not the parts directly criticizing roe in his analysis of the cases , judge alito called the courts' reasons for overturning the abortion regulations incredible , remarkable and extraordinary he suggested that many physicians , including those operating highvolume abortion clinics , have a financial interest in encouraging women to have abortions , and that such doctors were more worried about an irs agent investigating tax shelters than about criminal prosecution for an abortionrelated offense and in a threepage proposed introduction for a brief , he argued that what is clear is that so long as the court adheres to the several doctrines announced by roe v wade , the difficulties and conflicts illustrated by these cases will continue to recur coming as the supreme court heard its first abortion rights case in five years , the disclosure has assured that the subject will remain at the center of the debate over judge alito s nomination , in part because he would succeed justice sandra day o'connor , the swing vote in many such cases in addition to galvanizing the opposition of many liberal democrats , the memorandum ratchets up the pressure on the handful of republican senators who support abortion rights several , including senators susan collins and olympia j snowe , both of maine , and senator lincoln chafee , of rhode island , have said they will oppose a nominee committed to overturning roe v wade all three senators voted to confirm chief justice john g roberts jr none could be reached for comment judge alito , who sits on the united states court of appeals for the third circuit , has told senators that if confirmed to the supreme court he will weigh the value of upholding the abortion rights precedents even if he disagrees with the original decisions he has stopped short , however , of disclosing how he would vote but senate democrats said wednesday that the memorandum s arguments and language suggested that judge alito had prejudged the issues this new information heightens concern about judge alito s views regarding settled law' and his eagerness to engage in activism to change a law with which he disagrees , senator patrick j leahy of vermont , the ranking democrat on the judiciary committee , said in a statement but steve schmidt , a spokesman for the white house , said suggestions that the memorandum indicated how judge alito might rule from the bench cross the border into silly land judge alito wrote the memorandum as a lawyer giving tactical advice to his client , the reagan administration , mr schmidt said when interpreting precedent on the federal appeals court , he added , judge alito has voted in some cases to uphold and in others to strike down abortion restrictions when the thornburgh case reached the supreme court , mr schmidt noted , justice o'connor wrote a dissenting opinion that questioned the lowercourt decisions the majority opinion , written by justice harry blackmun , upheld them in a statement , senator arlen specter of pennsylvania , a republican supporter of abortion rights who is chairman of the judiciary committee , said he held out the possibility that subsequent precedents might have altered judge alito s views many times the supreme court has decided the issue , mr specter said , singling out the 1992 case of planned parenthood v casey but senator charles e schumer , a new york democrat on the judiciary committee , said , maybe at the hearings he can dispel this , but the more you learn the more he seems to have something of an agenda judge alito , for his part , turned in his answers wednesday to a senate judicial questionnaire in response to a query about judicial activism , judge alito argued that the supreme court had a special responsibility for selfquestioning because neither of the elected branches of government could provide a check on its role in interpreting the constitution judges must be appropriately modest in their estimation of their own abilities they must respect the judgments reached by their predecessors and they must be sensibly cautious about the scope of their decisions , judge alito wrote and judges should do all these things without shirking their duty to say what the law is and to carry out their proper role with energy and independence listing his memberships in clubs or organizations , judge alito wrote that recent disclosures reflected that in the mid1980 s he belonged to concerned alumni of princeton , a group that initially opposed the school s admission of women and later opposed its affirmative action policies but he added , i have no recollection of being a member , of attending meetings , or otherwise participating in the activities of the group judge alito also listed the cases from which he had recused himself during his 1990 hearings for confirmation to the third circuit , judge alito said he would recuse himself from any cases involving vanguard , a mutual fundcompany that held some of his investments in 2002 , judge alito sat in judgment of a case involving vanguard and stepped aside only after a party to the case objected democrats have questioned the lapse , which he called an accident he later sent senator specter a letter arguing that his initial pledge applied to only his first years on the court and noting that ethics guidelines did not require him to recuse himself his answers to his questionnaire , however , indicate that he continued to recuse himself from cases involving vanguard throughout his time on the court after reading judge alito s 1985 memorandum , democrats argued that the administration should disclose more documents from his work in the reagan administration solicitor general s office the bush administration has so far maintained that disclosing such documents would compromise the confidentiality of white house deliberations mr schmidt , the white house spokesman , said the administration was not changing that policy he said judge alito s memorandum that was disclosed wednesday had ended up in the files of other justice department officials and been transferred to the national archives during the clinton administration
it s a scheme so crazy it just might work step 1 make a movie about a pair of disreputable broadway producers out to make a killing by opening a surefire flop and stealing their investors' money step 2 turn said movie into a musical and open it on the real broadway step 3 turn around and make a film of the musical of the film , adding a couple of hollywood names , about 50 million in production frills and a healthy dollop of faith in the power of oldschool musical comedy that , in sum , is the story of the producers , version 30 , which will open in new york on dec 16 and nationwide on christmas day , 37 years after the original film put mel brooks on the map , winning him an oscar for best screenplay and a reputation as one of the funniest directors around a hit in 1968 , the producers was mr brooks s first film , a wild sendup of everything from theatrical pretensions to hippie culture to , yep , producers , those dastardly top feeders on the broadway food chain with zero mostel as the flopprone , ethically challenged producer max bialystock , and gene wilder as leo bloom , the timid accountant whom max corrupts , the producers only gained stature as it aged , regularly popping up on alltime best lists all of which , of course , might lead one to ask why fiddle with it \? the answer , it seems , is that this producers is not a remake at all , but rather a wholly new film based on the hit 2001 musical inspired by the original film this had to be the musical , said the new film s director , susan stroman we never harkened back to the original movie the new movie of the producers features almost entirely the same creative crew that made a smash out of the stage version , including ms stroman , a tony award winner who choreographed and directed the broadway musical and is making her film directing debut produced by jonathan sanger and mr brooks , who wrote the music and lyrics for the broadway musical , the new movie like the stage version stars nathan lane as bialystock and matthew broderick as bloom with a screenplay by mr brooks and thomas meehan , who helped write the musical s book , and the same sweetly sarcastic take on show people and the business they love , the new movie is , by every indication , a faithful recreation of what is being performed eight times a week at the st james theater i said we already have a movie of it and it s perfectly fine , but i thought maybe we should memorialize all these amazing performances , mr brooks said we wanted to make sure that the musical would be remembered , with the original songs and the original stars we did n't get in it to make money for universal , of course , it s another story the studio , which is releasing the movie domestically , no doubt cares less about historical preservation than selling tickets , and also has high hopes for its potential award prospects opening at a time when audiences have shown an appetite for musicals see chicago , phantom of the opera , moulin rouge the producers , which has grossed half a billion dollars worldwide , would also seem to have other things going for it , including , presumably , a builtin audience of hardcore broadway fans \( rent , another adaptation of a longrunning broadway show , is set to open on nov 23 \) except for this the stars are n't exactly bankable in the same way as , say , ren e zellweger or catherine zetajones , who replaced the broadway actors when chicago went to hollywood mr lane s and mr broderick s broadway bona fides are unquestionable they are now appearing in a soldout revival of neil simon s odd couple , at the brooks atkinson theater but their pull at the local multiplex is , well , almost bialystockian mr broderick was a broadway baby \( he won a tony in 1983 for his performance in brighton beach memoirs \) whose turn as the title character in ferris bueller s day off \( 1986 \) gave him a movie base as well but he has seen his film work tail off in recent years \( part of that may have to do with lengthy stints in the producers on broadway \) his last major movie , the 2004 remake of the stepford wives , was a disappointment before that , he had n't been seen in a film since 2000 , in you can count on me , the independent favorite written and directed by the playwright kenneth lonergan , one of mr broderick s best friends mr lane , meanwhile , has never managed to fully translate his stellar reputation as a stage comic to the screen his two biggest movie successes probably came a decade ago in the animated blockbuster the lion king \( 1994 \) , where he was heard , not seen , as the voice of timon , the wisecracking meerkat , and in the birdcage \( 1996 \) there s also the cruel arithmetic of audiences let s say , for example , that every person who ever saw the producers on broadway about three million in more than four and a half years went to see the producers movie and paid 10 that s a gross of about 30 million , which is about 20 million less than the cost of the film , even before marketing by contrast , chicago , rent \( both on broadway for nine years \) and phantom \( 17 years \) have had much longer runs on broadway , and thus a bigger potential audience and while chicago had the appeal of a story involving sultry , guntoting molls in skintight clothes , the producers is a different animal entirely shot in new york , the 2005 version has been set squarely in fedoraclad 1959 , complete with women in gowns , men in suits , dancing girls in spangles and oneliners , oneliners , oneliners \( the 1968 version was set in the hippiehappy 60 s \) ms stroman , whose stage version is peppered with inside jokes and broadway references , said she wanted her movie to pay homage to movie musicals like royal wedding , the band wagon and singin' in the rain 'chicago' was sexy and edgy , ms stroman conceded we are not sexy and edgy we 're a comedy comedy reigns supreme which , of course , is what the producers of the producers are banking on none of the other recent broadway movies , after all , have had many giggles we made it a comedy musical , rather than a musical comedy , mr brooks said we rest our case on the production numbers , but most of the time it s nathan and matthew in their skulduggery not that the dancing is anything to sniff at , said ms stroman , a belief she said was borne out by early test screenings of the producers at malls in los angeles and suburban new jersey people applauded after the production numbers , she said the universal people were shocked and i was shocked and mr sanger , whose producing r sum includes everything from television movies to an 'n sync concert film to vanilla sky , said that mr broderick s and mr lane s box office power had never been an issue we felt that the selling point for the movie was 'the producers , ' mr sanger said and we felt that nathan and matthew were the best casting possible they were just integral to what 'the producers' was that said , the producers made some concessions in casting , bringing in will ferrell to play franz liebkind , the unrepentant nazi who writes springtime for hitler , the aforementioned surefire flop \( brad oscar was nominated for a tony award for his turn as liebkind in the broadway production \) the film s sex appeal , meanwhile , balances on the long legs of uma thurman , who took over for the broadway star cady huffman , as ulla , the swedish secretary lusted after by bialystock and bloom universal said , 'please give us some movie names , just to open it , ' and we said sure , mr brooks said and will and uma turned out to be great mr sanger said mr ferrell , in particular , would be important to the movie s success the traditional audience for these tends to be an older audience , the 25 to 60 s , rather than the 12 to 25 s , which is the biggest moviegoing audience , he said and we think that will ferrell will broaden it out to the younger audience still , the producers are including boca raton , fla , the retireerich community where mr brooks is considered a living legend , when the movie opens in six cities on dec 16 whether the people who loved the musical spread good wordofmouth to the public at large remains to be seen it worked with chicago , which started small and eventually grossed more than 300 million worldwide and won an academy award for best picture one thing is for certain mr brooks says this will be the last time he fiddles with the producers i felt like yoga berra it s d j vu all over again , he said what s next \? a claymation version \? there s got to be something else in my bag of tricks
lahore , pakistan , july 25 two experienced militants , both veterans of the war in afghanistan , told an independent pakistani journalist here last week that they had met one of the july 7 london bombing suspects , shehzad tanweer , on a trip to a known militant training camp north of the capital , islamabad one of the militants interviewed said mr tanweer struck him as a good muslim who was eager to assassinate the pakistani president , gen pervez musharraf i wish i could do that , he recalled mr tanweer as saying the militants , both members of jaishemuhammad , an organization officially banned by the government and implicated in two assassination attempts against general musharraf , spoke on condition that their names not be used because they do not want to be apprehended by the government they said they met mr tanweer , 22 , a briton of pakistani descent , last winter , but they would not be more specific on dates for fear of revealing their own identities their statements could not be independently confirmed , and a senior government official who is following the investigation said he had no knowledge of such a visit the militants were not interviewed by a correspondent for the new york times , but spoke extensively on two occasions to a journalist working on contract for this newspaper the two men said they had all traveled together from rawalpindi , a garrison town adjacent to the capital , to the shah ismail shaheed madrasa in mansehra , a heavily forested mountainous district where guerrilla training camps continue to operate , said diplomats and militants interviewed by the new york times mr tanweer , the two militants said , was at the madrasa , which doubles as a training camp , on a short study tour , which is akin to an orientation session for potential guerrilla recruits he was accompanied by two other men a pakistani and another briton of pakistani descent , they said none of them were there to receive arms training , they said mr tanweer and his companions left after four or five days the two men would not say where the three went its remoteness and landscape have made mansehra , situated on the ancient silk route , an ideal address for jihad training for at least 15 years , it has housed a number of rotating makeshift camps for fighters eventually dispatched to kashmir and afghanistan mr tanweer , along with another bombing suspect , mohammad sidique khan , also a briton born to pakistani parents , visited pakistan between november 2004 and february of this year , according to pakistani immigration records they arrived in karachi , a sprawling arabian sea coast city , but it is unclear where they went from there and whom they saw mr tanweer s maternal uncle , tahir pervez , said mr tanweer had visited the family home in a dusty village , kota chotiya , near the central pakistani city of faisalabad mr pervez had recounted his nephew s admiration for osama bin laden , a pakistani newspaper reported but in an interview with the new york times last week , he denied that report and characterized mr tanweer as a deeply religious young man who spent over a month in the village , doing little other than praying and playing cricket a third bombing suspect , hasib mir hussain , had also been reported to have visited pakistan last july , according to pakistani immigration records it later turned out that the immigration records actually referred to another young man by the same name , not the bombing suspect pakistani officials have maintained that no arrests have been made in connection with the july 7 attacks , but that hundreds have been picked up in an intensified campaign against banned militant organizations
five striking images of terri schiavo appeared on television yesterday one showed a beaming young woman with long , wavy hair , apparently in front of a christmas tree another showed a bride in a lacy highcollared dress , flanked by her parents , no groom in sight in a third portrait , ms schiavo , in a spiky haircut and heavy makeup , wore an ambiguous expression a fourth showed a widenecked woman in bed , regarding a visitor blankly none of these pictures were dated but the final image , a video clip , came with a date august 2001 in the video , ms schiavo has her head tilted back at an odd angle she can be seen smiling and looking up at her mother in what might be described as wonderment the images were significant because they hinted at what all the pundits failed to address the humaninterest side of ms schiavo s story who is she \? how sick is she \? should her husband or her parents make lifeordeath decisions for her \? ms schiavo s ambiguous predicament invokes so many serious ethical questions in fact that it was baffling to see the news channels concentrate on nothing but contrived washington debates the talking heads touched on the details of ms schiavo s case only when they served their preset conclusions rightwing commentators maintained that ms schiavo could be rehabilitated those on the left insisted either that alertness seen in the video was misleading , or that it had faded since the video was made to the viewer , the provocative images provided few answers it is clear only that a certain blankness befell ms schiavo when her heart stopped in 1990 but as viewers were regularly reminded , ms schiavo is not brain dead according to most reports , she is in a persistent vegetative state , which means , cnn said , that she cannot think , speak or respond to commands , but that she might smile or grimace spontaneously cnn s description of ms schiavo s mental state seemed to be at odds with the video of ms schiavo responding with clear pleasure to her mother s ministrations but that video though often presented merely as file videotape of ms schiavo was made by ms schiavo s parents , mary and bob schindler , who are intent on proving that their braindamaged daughter ought not to be denied lifesupport measures william kristol , the founder of the weekly standard , ventured to assert with conviction on fox news , she can recover substantially if she gets the proper rehabilitation also on fox news , mara liasson and juan williams , correspondents for npr , responded to mr kristol by trying to deflect attention from ms schiavo s mental state by discussing political matters ms liasson , like others on the left , added that ms schiavo s predicament might , if nothing else , serve as a reminder to all of us to write a living will but what did any of them really know about the medical and personal questions involved here \? ms schiavo s case is complex , and the complicated dynamics of her family life , as well as her medical history , have been a subject for the courts , but rarely for television the networks missed a chance to do the story right , to cover its full arc and give viewers more than a few snapshots on which to base their discussion of this pressing moral issue all the usual suspects on fox and cnn could talk about were the political implications , glossing over medical aspects of whether this woman ought to live or die photo mary schindler with her daughter terri schiavo in a video her family made on aug 11 , 2001 \( photo by schindler family video , via associated press \)
charleston , sc , oct 11 allan houston took a jog or two and antonio davis popped in long enough to have dinner , but the knicks will break training camp wednesday with no clear sign that either one will contribute this season in fact , it seems more likely that neither will the october movements of two 30something veterans rarely warrants more than a footnote , but the knicks are larry brown s team now , and he is generally partial to players with receding hairlines in philadelphia , brown had eric snow and aaron mckie to help him manage the impetuous allen iverson , and in detroit he had a polished group with experience and success the knicks have little experience and even less success , and the absences of players like davis and houston could put a dent in their progress brown has referred to his babyfaced group as like a college team , and he recently noted this is not the same situation i walked into in detroit those guys all knew how to play there were n't a lot of things that i told them that they had n't heard before or done before not so with the knicks counting trainingcamp invitees , brown has 11 players who are 25 or younger , including three rookies of the knicks who are here and practicing daily , only penny hardaway is over 30 , and brown said the lack of experience posed some concern oh , yeah , you ca n't invent that , brown said tuesday but penny is with us and he s been great allan s been great but we just are very young that s just the way it is you hope that the guys we do have that have been through it will continue to do their best to help these young guys there is only so much a veteran can do , however , from the bench which is where houston may remain or from chicago , which is where davis remains about halfway through the nineday camp here , the 34yearold houston had a recurrence of pain in his troublesome left knee , forcing him to cease most oncourt activity he has been shut down until next week going at this intensity is new , so i'm going to have to just continue to adjust , said houston , who is struggling to stay patient houston has not scrimmaged or played in a game since january , and he has not played painfree in two years he says he hopes to have a better sense of his rehabilitation next week davis , meanwhile , has yet to take the court with his new teammates he reported here last thursday night , after being traded with eddy curry from chicago but davis was back in chicago by the next afternoon the official explanation is that davis , 36 , is attending to family matters an unspecified operation for his motherinlaw but davis has also made it clear he does not want to leave chicago another bad sign curry was wearing jersey no 34 on monday he originally opted for no 32 , explaining that no 34 was reserved for davis the knicks are not yet working on a buyout of davis s 14 million contract , although that day may come nba officials are leery of any deal to waive davis and are watching with great interest if davis were to immediately return to the bulls , it could be considered salarycap circumvention brown and isiah thomas , the team president , want davis in a knicks uniform to help tutor their flock of young big men and to provide some defensive toughness his role does n't have to be what it was when he was younger , said brown , who previously coached davis in indiana but the fact that we have all these young kids , young big kids , he 'd be great brown last week described davis as devastated by the trade the fact that he s not here , i doubt that he has any different feelings , brown said tuesday davis has played in 93 playoff games houston \( 63 \) , hardaway \( 64 \) and malik rose \( 82 \) are the only knicks to have played in the finals but hardaway was a bit player last season , and it is not yet clear what role rose will play for brown stephon marbury , quentin richardson and maurice taylor were cited for their leadership abilities by brown , but none of them have had much success in his career i think it s something that we ca n't correct right now , brown said but you hope that within the guys we have , people will step up and take that responsibility rebounds before flying home wednesday , the knicks will visit with 200 families at charleston air force base all of the families have at least one relative serving in iraq or afghanistan maurice taylor returned to practice tuesday after missing three straight days because of a strained achilles' tendon quentin richardson is still bothered by a strained hamstring penny hardaway sat out monday s practice to rest what he called a tight quadriceps muscle , but he returned tuesday
many seemingly authoritative figures , not all of them partisan shills , say that the american economy has fully recovered from the recession that began in 2001 they point to the unemployment rate , which has fallen from a peak of 63 percent in 2003 to 5 percent last month that s not quite as low as the 42 percent unemployment rate in february 2001 , when the recession began , but it s fairly low by historical standards for some reason , however , the public is n't feeling prosperous gallup tells us that only 3 percent of americans describe the economy as excellent , and only 33 percent describe it as good maybe people are just ungrateful maybe they 've been misled by negative media reports maybe they 're grumpy about their paychecks adjusted for inflation , average weekly earnings have been flat for the past five years or maybe the figures on unemployment are giving a false signal economists who argue that there s something wrong with the unemployment numbers are buzzing about a new study by katharine bradbury , an economist at the federal reserve bank of boston , which suggests that millions of americans who should be in the labor force are n't the addition of these hypothetical participants , she writes , would raise the unemployment rate by one to threeplus percentage points some background the unemployment rate is only one of several numbers economists use to assess the jobs picture when the economy is generating an abundance of jobs , economists expect to see strong growth in the payrolls reported by employers and in the number of people who say they have jobs , together with a rise in the length of the average workweek they also expect to see wage gains well in excess of inflation , as employers compete to attract workers in fact , we see none of these things as berkeley s j bradford delong writes on his influential economics blog , we have four of five indicators telling us that the state of the job market is not that good and only one the unemployment rate reading green in particular , even the most favorable measures show that employment growth has lagged well behind population growth over the past four years yet the measured unemployment rate is n't much higher than it was in early 2001 how is that possible \? the answer , according to the survey used to estimate the unemployment rate , is a decline in labor force participation nonworking americans are n't considered unemployed unless they are actively looking for work , and hence counted as part of the labor force and a large number of people have , for some reason , dropped out of the official labor force those with a downbeat view of the jobs picture argue that the low reported unemployment rate is a statistical illusion , that there are millions of americans who would be looking for jobs if more jobs were available those with an upbeat view argue that labor force participation has fallen for reasons that have nothing to do with job availability for example , young adults , recognizing the importance of education , may have chosen to stay in school longer that s where dr bradbury s study comes in she shows that the upbeat view does n't hold up in the face of a careful examination of the numbers in fact , because older americans , especially older women , are more likely to work than in the past , labor force participation should have risen , not fallen , over the past four years as a result , she suggests that there may be considerable slack in the us labor market there are at least 16 million and possibly as many as 51 million people who are n't counted as unemployed but would take jobs if they were available there s both good news and bad news in that assessment the good news is that the economy probably has plenty of room to expand before inflation becomes a problem \( which implies that the fed s decision to start raising interest rates was premature \) the bad news is that it s hard to see where further expansion will come from we 've already had four years of extremely loose fiscal and monetary policy tax cuts have pushed the federal budget deep into the red low interest rates have helped generate a housing bubble that has lifted real estate prices to ludicrous heights in major parts of the country if all that was n't enough to give us a full economic recovery , what will \? oped columnist email krugman nytimescom

william p cheshire jr , the florida doctor cited by gov jeb bush yesterday in his announcement that he would intervene again in the case of terri schiavo , is a neurologist and bioethicist whose life and work have been guided by his religious beliefs dr cheshire directs a laboratory at the mayo clinic branch in jacksonville dealing with unconscious reflexes like digestion , and he is director of biotech ethics at the center for bioethics and human dignity , a nonprofit group founded by more than a dozen leading christian bioethicists , in the words of its web site in an article last year in physician magazine , published by the evangelical group focus on the family , dr cheshire , 44 , said doctors are too quick to declare that a patient is in a persistent vegetative state i'm not sure the diagnosis is used consistently , he told physician i am sometimes asked if a patient is in pvs , but it s only been a few days by definition , you have to wait at least a month yesterday , in an affidavit supporting a petition by the florida department of children and families in the case , dr cheshire said it was more likely that ms schiavo was in a minimally conscious state although terri did not demonstrate during our 90minute visit compelling evidence of verbalization , conscious awareness or volitional behavior , he wrote , yet the visitor has the distinct sense of the presence of a living human being who seems at some level to be aware of some things around her mr bush called dr cheshire a renowned neurologist , but he is not widely known in the neurology or bioethics fields asked about him , dr arthur caplan , director of the center for bioethics at the university of pennsylvania , replied , who \? dr cheshire , who graduated from princeton and earned a medical degree at west virginia university , did not return calls to the mayo clinic seeking comment the clinic said in a statement that his work on the schiavo case was not related to his work at the clinic and that the state had invited his opinion he observed the patient at her bedside and conducted an extensive review of her medical history but did not conduct an examination , the statement said dr caplan said that was not good enough there is just no excuse for going in and making any pronouncement about the state that terri schiavo is in unless you 're going to go in and do some form of technologically mediated scanning that would overturn what s on the record already , he said dr ronald cranford , a neurologist and medical ethicist at the university of minnesota medical school who has examined ms schiavo on behalf of the florida courts and declared her to be irredeemably braindamaged , said , i have no idea who this cheshire is , and added he has to be bogus , a prolife fanatic you 'll not find any credible neurologist or neurosurgeon to get involved at this point and say she s not vegetative he said there was no doubt that ms schiavo was in a persistent vegetative state her cat scan shows massive shrinkage of the brain , he said her eeg is flat flat there s no electrical activity coming from her brain dr cheshire entered the field of bioethics relatively late in his career a profile of him on the web site of trinity international university , where he enrolled in the master s program in bioethics in 2000 , states that he was searching for how he should integrate his faith with his medical career after getting the degree , he became an adjunct professor of bioethics there a search of his publication record in the online medical library pubmed yielded articles in medical journals , with a focus on headache pain , in particular trigeminal neuralgia , a painful disorder originating in a cranial nerve called the trigeminal none of the papers dealt with persistent vegetative states his papers show a fondness for puns , as in the title of a letter to the new england journal of medicine about a patient whose fillings caused an electrical current that made her condition worse the shocking tooth about trigeminal neuralgia he was also the author , with others from the center for bioethics and human dignity , of a paper opposing stem cell research the center s web site notes that he and his wife and four children are members of the episcopal church of the redeemer in jacksonville and that he has done medical missionary work in honduras and siberia he has also written poetry , including exit ramp , a poem about the movement to allow physicianassisted suicide that uses the metaphor of a highway offramp to warn of a different kind of slippery slope such killing fast degenerates , despite concern for patients' best , into a plot that terminates without explicit prerequest
austin , tex , march 2 win or lose , thomas van orden savored the moment wednesday as the lawsuit he brought here three years ago was preoccupying the highest judges of the land in washington what are the chances of this case making it to the supreme court \? he asked from behind a borrowed computer at the university of texas law library my god ! my little case it is hardly little a constitutional challenge to displaying the ten commandments on the grounds of the texas capitol , and so , a case that could rewrite aspects of churchstate relations when the high court rules , perhaps this summer but at any point in its journey up the legal ladder , mr van orden said , it might have failed for the unlikeliest of reasons a lack of paper , or postage mr van orden , a suspended lawyer who put his age at 60 , compiled the case while homeless , living in a tent on a wooded tract in austin , surviving on food stamps , while writing his briefs at the law library and scrounging for writing materials you can find paper and pens on the college campus , he said just look down at times , he said , he lacked the 10 cents to print out even one page of his briefs and did not have the money to mail his appeal to the federal appeals court in new orleans but he disdained what he portrayed as the caricaturing of his story by journalists ok , so i did crawl in out of the woods , he said , but i brought some knowledge with me it is not about him , mr van orden said again and again in an interview wednesday , deflecting personal questions while talking animatedly about the legal issues and yet volunteering intriguing snippets of biography that included a stint as a pilot it s not my lawsuit , he said it s every american s mr van orden said he had turned down an offer by a lawyer who argued his case , erwin chemerinsky , to pay for a trip to washington to witness the argument i do n't think i should accept anyone s money to go , he said he also said that he had overcome an unspecified psychological problem , that he was eager for a steady job you do n't actually think i like living in a tent , do you \? and that he had gotten , and laughed off , offers from hollywood for his story how do you do a movie of a guy at his desk researching legal briefs \? he asked there s no car chases , no exploding bombs but he said that if anyone persisted , i would say , 'bring cash and tell me what time to meet your plane ' tall , with lanky , centerparted hair and a thick brush mustache mr van orden , who declined to be photographed as well said he had not gone looking for a cause this one found me , he said he said he had come across the ten commandments monument on the capitol grounds several years ago and , based on his readings of separationofpowers cases thought something ought to be done , and why not me \? so i did it he said he was not drawn to the case by any antipathy toward religion he was brought up southern baptist , he said but raised questions with a state preservation office and was told the display would not come down i never said , 'i demand you take it down , ' mr van orden said i'm not rude but he did begin researching a federal lawsuit that he filed in 2002 i was demonstrating what you could do with a pencil and paper and a law book , mr van orden said a graduate of southern methodist university s law school in dallas , mr van orden said he had practiced criminal law in houston , principally defending drug dealers , until something happened to me that he said destroyed me previously published articles said he fell prey to acute anxiety and did not complete some cases he had been engaged to handle , accounts he declined to discuss beyond saying , i never stole a dime from anybody texas state bar records list him as suspended for disciplinary sanctions and default in payment of occupation tax he said he had been divorced for 15 years and had a son and a daughter little by little , other details of mr van orden s life emerged he said he had served in the vietnamera army and had narrowly avoided duty as a helicopter gunner by signing up as a lawyer in the judge advocate general s corps but he said his brother , a navy pilot who served on the same aircraft carrier as senator john mccain , was shot down and killed mr van orden said he himself later became a pilot flying light planes and training flight students and walked away from at least one serious crash he was always drawn to constitutional law , he said , and was so enamored of benjamin nathan cardozo , the former supreme court justice , that he named his son after him in the ten commandments case , mr van orden said , the central questions were what was the government s purpose in putting up the display in 1961 , and what message did it send to people \? if religious , it was unacceptable , he said moreover , he said , the version of the commandments at the capitol omits part of the hebrew text referring to god s covenant with the jews , raising another religious issue , he said mr van orden lost in the district court and , after managing to pay for enough copies and postage , appealed to the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit , in new orleans , where he also lost then , he said , seizing on conflicting opinions by different federal appeals courts , he asked the supreme court to resolve the issue that s what the supreme court does for a living , he said mr chemerinsky , a law professor at duke university , said that after the court agreed to hear the case in late 2003 , mr van orden called him one of the rare times mr van orden used a telephone and the two agreed to collaborate mr chemerinsky flew to austin last november and with mr van orden walked the capitol grounds , seeing the monument and discussing the case he was extremely knowledgeable in the law in this case , mr chemerinsky said they did not discuss mr van orden s homelessness , he said , adding , it was none of my business they exchanged drafts by email , mr van orden working at the university of texas law library and the state law library , using his own email accounts honoring his favorite roman philosopher , seneca mr van orden derided the clich s of homelessness that he said reporters had unfairly stuck to him over the years he did not travel with bundles , he said , and took pride in his clean clothes and grooming , which he attended to in ways he did not detail i'm surprised they do n't have me trailing a yellow dog , he said , exaggerating he ate on food stamps at the upscale central market , pitched his tent nightly and took it down each morning in a wooded location he did not specify , traveled on a free bus pass granted for a veteran s disability and read newspapers and magazines free at newsstands he said his happiest moment was not when he heard the supreme court was taking his case but when his teenage daughter read the story and tracked him down by email , breaking a long estrangement
washington , may 21 a former senior officer in a proisrael lobbying group who was fired because of his involvement in an espionage case says that he did nothing wrong and that he does not understand why he is the subject of a criminal investigation i did not violate any us laws , said the former officer , steve rosen , who is at the center of the swirling counterintelligence investigation mr rosen was a wellconnected senior policy analyst and lobbyist for the group , the american israel public affairs committee , until he was fired last month leaders of other major jewish organizations some who are close to aipac , as the organization is known , and others who are not say they believe that mr rosen and a colleague , keith weissman , were fired to insulate the group from criticism ahead of its annual convention , which opens on sunday aipac denies that mr rosen and mr weissman were fired because of their association with lawrence a franklin , a former pentagon analyst who was arrested on may 4 on charges of illegally disclosing military secrets no charges have been filed against the two , and the organization has not been implicated in the investigation , law enforcement officials said many senior government officials , including secretary of state condoleezza rice and the house speaker , j dennis hastert , are scheduled to attend the convention , as is prime minister ariel sharon of israel none of the major officials have canceled their plans to attend aipac has long been an important organization to the government officials strive to keep close relationships with it even with the two former aipac officials under federal investigation , support for aipac among other jewish groups remains strong still , there is little question that the organization s lobbying arm has been damaged by the loss of mr rosen and mr weissman , and the broader espionage accusations may discourage some government officials from dealing with aipac mr rosen and mr weissman often spoke with colleagues in the israeli embassy , and as part of their work traded information with the israelis some middlelevel people in government will be hesitant to talk to aipac now , said malcolm i hoenlein , executive vice chairman of the conference of presidents of major american jewish organizations , an umbrella group whose members include aipac he and others suggested that some government officials might fear that they , too , could be swept up in an espionage case patrick dorton , a spokesman for aipac , said that the organization continues to have meetings and exchanges at all levels of government morris j amitay , a former executive director of aipac , voiced another concern shared by almost everyone interviewed the risk , he said , that the department of justice comes up with something that could be incriminating to aipac over several years one or both of the aipac lobbyists held four meetings with mr franklin , who was under surveillance by justice department investigators when mr rosen and mr weissman began meeting him , they too were under surveillance during a final meeting between mr franklin and mr weissman in july 2004 , mr franklin was serving as a government informant , and the meeting was taped the people sympathetic to mr rosen s case said they regarded the meeting as a sting because mr franklin described information about threats to israeli operatives who were working in northern and southern iraq iranian agents , mr franklin said , planned to kill them mr weissman told mr rosen about this , the people said , and the two set out to confirm what mr franklin had said by talking to american and israeli officials soon after , an fbi agent questioned the two and asked if they had spread classified information they said no and maintained in discussions with the agent and with aipac officers that mr weissman never heard mr franklin say the material he was describing was classified later , lawyers learned that the tape of mr franklin s last conversation with mr weissman showed that he did note that the information was classified after learning that , aipac fired mr rosen and mr weissman , said several friends of aipac who were briefed on the investigation
hartford , sept 30 anne bailey , 72 , and betty palmer , 66 , fell in love canoeing in canada seven years ago and now have an engraved metal sign in their driveway with prominent lettering , bailey palmer their friends , joan smith , 66 , and marilyn ottone , 57 , occasional guests at cocktail hour in the comfortable bailey palmer house , in the woods of rural new hartford , have been open about their relationship since it began in 1974 yet for all the years of commitment between the two couples , now retired , they do not plan to take the newest legal step for gay couples , entering civil unions , which connecticut begins recognizing on saturday , the second state to do so , after vermont for many of our friends who are gay , this is not a significant event in their lives , said ms smith , 66 , a retired manager for an insurance company it does n't mean that i can now claim marilyn as a dependent it does n't mean that i can leave her my money without consequence it does n't give me the same rights as the average american none of the four reject civil unions on principle or say they would refuse anything less than full gay marriage , which is legal next door in massachusetts instead , after years of devotion to each other , they say they are emotionally secure in their relationships regardless of legal recognition and on a practical level , the women echo the uncertainty that legal experts say surrounds state civil unions what , exactly , are the benefits \? not everyone is spending time worrying beginning saturday , town clerks in some of connecticut s 169 cities and towns will keep their offices open to accept applications for civil unions the rest will begin accepting applications on monday some gay partners , including a state lawmaker , are planning saturday ceremonies in parks , churches and city halls even those like ms bailey and ms smith who are not planning civil unions see them as progress it s remarkable that we 've come from the days that we spent in coalblack bars in provincetown to the light of day , ms smith said but the new law , which effectively grants gay couples every state right and benefit that married couples receive , does not resolve many major questions , including how gay couples will be treated in other states , what their status is under federal law , which does not recognize gay unions , and whether it is financially wise to legally unite everybody s amazed at the complexities that this law will present , said brad gallant , an estate lawyer with day , berry howard , which has set up an estateplanning group for samesex couples in april , the democraticcontrolled general assembly and gov m jodi rell , a republican , approved the law , making connecticut the second state to approve civil unions and the first to do so without court pressure massachusetts , after a 2003 court decision , began allowing gays to marry california has a broad domestic partnership law , though last month gov arnold schwarzenegger vetoed a gay marriage bill passed by the state legislature it is unclear what rights will cross state lines some experts believe that vermont , which approved civil unions in 2000 after a lawsuit , and connecticut will be reciprocal , that each state will recognize a civil union from the other but connecticut does not recognize gay marriages from massachusetts within the state , the new law will ensure a broad range of rights gay partners can serve as conservators of their partners' estates they can receive state tax deductions if they inherit money from their partners they can be assured of hospital visiting rights they can file joint state income tax returns and take the same deductions married couples do yet most of the largest tax benefits from inheritance and income are federal , leaving what mr gallant called a huge inequality the status of gay parents may also not change in 2000 , the state made it easier for samesex couples to adopt children , and some experts say that status as an adoptive parent may carry more force than a civil union license , particularly if the child was born before the civil union occurred parents who 've already gone through those adoptions are not going to gain anything else , perhaps , said carolyn kaas , a law professor at quinnipiac university , which held a seminar in hamden on friday to explore the legal questions of civil unions an advocacy group , love makes a family , says it plans to continue its push for gay marriage in connecticut but even gay marriage within the state would leave questions until the federal government is willing to define relationships by state law , we 're not going to fully achieve equality for samesex couples , ms kaas said even with so many uncertainties , many gay couples plan to get civilized , as some are calling the unions art feltman , a state representative from hartford , said he was planning to be united with his partner of 25 years at a ceremony at hartford city hall on saturday and chelsea turner , a lobbyist who helped push the civil union bill through the legislature this spring , said she and her partner are having a ceremony , kind of a renewal of vows if you will , in elizabeth park , which straddles the border between hartford and west hartford a year ago , in the same place , they declared their commitment before 120 guests we 've talked about starting a family , and it will no doubt add a comfort that we would not have had , ms turner said of the new law i guess it s not about any one individual right or responsibility it s more about being able to say to a principal when you pick your kid up at school , 'i'm little johnny s parent' and to not be questioned about that
in his book what s the matter with kansas \? the liberal writer thomas frank argues that conservative politicians have come to rely on a brazen baitandswitch strategy he says that they often champion oldfashioned values while campaigning , only to turn their attention to economic issues once elected the trick never ages , the illusion never wears off , he writes , contending that voters who say they care about , for example , abortion often wind up electing representatives who seem more interested in reducing the capitalgains tax he s mystified or , more accurately , horrified by this seemingly paradoxical system vote to strike a blow against elitism receive a social order in which wealth is more concentrated than ever before in our lifetimes despite the book s widespread success , there is no evidence to suggest that the rapper 50 cent is among the armchair political scientists who have bought it still , its central argument might sound familiar to anyone following his career his new album , the massacre , arrives in stores today perhaps not coincidentally , it arrives just as headlines are confirming 50 cent s reputation as hiphop s leading troublemaker longrunning tension within his group , g unit , boiled over on monday as 50 cent and his prot g s gathered at the new york radio station hot 97 , wqhtfm \( 971 \) , to denounce the game , a former g unit affiliate who was defrocked for demonstrating insufficient loyalty and gratitude the interview was cut short when shots were fired outside the station , seemingly the result of a fight between members of 50 cent s entourage and members of the game s entourage , the police said one man , who a police official said was affiliated with the game , was shot in the leg the incident is not likely to keep fans away from the record store 50 cent had already been signed \( to columbia records \) , shot \( nine times , as he s not shy about reminding people \) and cut loose from the music industry by 2002 , when he began his astonishing comeback on a series of mixtapes and underground singles he portrayed himself as a mischievous antihero with nothing to lose he took particular delight in poking fun at ja rule , another queens rapper , who was known for his sugary \( but growly \) pop hits listening to 50 cent s mumbled wisecracks \( i'm back in the game , shorty , to rule and conquer you sing for hos and sound like the cookie monster \) , you could almost imagine him as a crusader , striking blows against the hiphop elite then , in early 2003 , came his get rich or die tryin , ' one of the most successful hiphop debut albums of all time , and success meant that 50 cent had to stray from the oldfashioned values that got him elected no rapper can sell millions of records without making love songs , and 50 cent mastered the thuglove subgenre , topping the charts with singalong hits about flirting \( in da club \) , sex \( pimp \) and even romance \( 21 questions \) his success was a baitandswitch 50 cent had come not to praise ja rule but to bury him and then , sneakily , to replace him the massacre \( shady aftermath interscope \) is predestined to be another smash it is a collection of stark but sly threats and comeons , nearly as addictive as its predecessor the shooting on monday may seem to fit with 50 cent s image , but if you turn on the radio right now you 'll probably hear a slightly different character as of last week 50 cent was behind three of america s six favorite songs , and all three are full of dancefloor pickup lines there s the simple and sinuous club track disco inferno \( in which 50 cent rhymes , li'l mama , show me how you move it better yet , put your back into it \) and candy shop \( a duet with 50 cent s rb prot g e olivia \) , which both come from the massacre the third is how we do , a collaboration with 50 cent s newest enemy , the game , in which 50 cent takes a break from tough talk to purr , touch me , tease me , kiss me , please me i give it to you just how you like it , girl threats may have gotten him elected , but it s comeons that keep him in office some rappers dazzle with wildly adventurous beats or instantly quotable lyrics , but 50 cent s style has always been both more and less subtle he s a crafty songwriter , specializing in obvious but nearly irresistible tracks that sound better the more you hear them on get rich or die tryin' , 50 cent often sounded more convincing when he was sneering at men than when he was leering at women but now the situation is reversed his singsong voice sounds best at its quietest , and his behindthebeat flow sounds best at its laziest for get in my car , the producer hitek contributes a sluggish backbeat and a sprightly fivenote guitar lick while 50 cent shows off his perverse charm , bragging , i got no pickup lines because , of course , he does n't need any for so amazing , 50 cent delivers thuglove boilerplate while olivia sings an rb refrain and a baltimore love thing takes this thuglove formula in a clever and unexpected direction the pledges of devotion might sound surprisingly sweet \( if you give birth , i 'll already be in love with your kids \) , until you realize that the protagonist is heroin personified , serenading a junkie like the best politicians , 50 cent has a knack for uniting disparate , even seemingly incompatible , notions into an appealing package he delivers his taunts and his pleas with the same notquiteharmless grin , which helps persuade listeners to ignore the seeming contradictions \( for starters hardknock tales of life on the streets of queens sound a bit less convincing coming from a man living in farmington , conn \) and so while 50 cent is a long way removed from being the mixtape hero he was in 2002 , he still finds time to pick fights with some unlikely foes piggy bank includes insults aimed at fat joe and jadakiss , who both have tougher reputations than 50 cent , and have promised to respond but what s really memorable about the song is n't the fighting words but the hypnotic chorus , delivered like a schoolyard taunt clicketyclank , clicketyclank the money goes into my piggy bank his foes can respond however they want , but for rappers and politicians and many others , oldfashioned values \( hiphop and otherwise \) are no match for economic issues if the massacre is n't quite as exciting as get rich or die tryin' , that is partly because it s not as surprising we already know who 50 cent is and how his strategy works but on a track like ski mask way , a criminalminded rhyme with a velvety beat by disco d , it s clear that none of this really matters like many a hustler before him , 50 cent has found out that giving people what they want is n't always the same as giving them what they 're asking for like all the best scams , this one has no end in sight the trick never ages , the illusion never wears off
roger clemens has won 329 major league games , and another 10 in what is known as the postseason , but despite defying a thunder of boos by allowing two hits and striking out nine over seven scoreless innings in the astros' 10 loss to the mets last night , he is still 0 for shea stadium in two starts there for the yankees , he was 02 in one start there with the blue jays in 1997 , he was tagged for seven runs in six innings and lost in two starts there for the red sox during the 1986 world series , he did n't get a decision in either game you would think that the shea savants would have welcomed clemens with cheers for having been without a victory in flushing by the bay but they preferred to boo the memory of moments that mike piazza , the mets' catcher , wished he could forget his beaning by clemens during the 2000 season and clemens s flinging of piazza s broken bat in his direction during the 2000 world series i felt good considering how cool it was , clemens said later you have to make good pitches when the game s that close the boos began as soon as clemens appeared on the outfield grass to loosen his right arm before warming up in the bullpen when clemens hopped out of the astros' dugout , louder boos serenaded him to the mound and after carlos beltran s twoout single to left in the first inning , cheers greeted piazza s arrival in the batter s box but on a 21 count , piazza bounced into a force play before piazza also walked and flied out against clemens last night , his career batting average against clemens was 471 , with four homers but his early success against clemens turned sour after the beaning until that highinside fastball crashed off his helmet at yankee stadium , piazza had strafed clemens for 7 hits in 12 atbats , including three home runs and a double since the beaning , including an 0 for 3 that involved the brokenbat episode at the stadium during the 2000 world series , piazza is now 1 for 10 against clemens , the only hit a homer clemens watchers also wondered if he might dust beltran , his astros teammate late last season but now the mets' center fielder he was a great teammate , beltran said yesterday while waiting his turn in batting practice , but when i was in kansas city , i did n't hit him too good during his royals career before his midseason trade to the astros last year , beltran batted 217 against clemens with only 3 hits in 14 atbats , and no homers but he did n't remember having to lean or fall away from any brushback pitches no , he said , smiling as he lifted his chin none of those and there were none of those last night for piazza or beltran willie randolph , the mets' new manager , remembered clemens as the yankees' ace \( when randolph was a yankees coach \) and as the red sox' ace \( when randolph was the batter \) who was ejected in a 1990 american league championship series game at oakland we did n't like him too much when we played against him , randolph recalled , referring to when clemens was with the red sox and the blue jays but with the yankees , you learned how hard he worked he s in the gym he s studying hitters great pitchers do n't just throw they have a real plan , randolph added and if i see him in the tunnel here , i 'll give him a big hug , but he is not one of my favorite people anymore and the time he got ejected in that playoff game , i was at the plate randolph , then the athletics' second baseman , was the batter when clemens shouted angrily at terry cooney , the plate umpire , over a call roger was frustrated early that day , randolph said when he yelled something at the umpire , i said 'you going to take that \? you going to let him get away with that \? ' i think i got him ejected randolph was also a yankee witness to both clemens s beaning of piazza and his flinging the broken bat in piazza s direction roger is always going to do what it takes to protect his part of the plate , randolph said the bat , i just thought it was a reaction roger s very intense that intensity has made clemens , who will turn 43 on aug 4 , perhaps the most dependable starting pitcher in the major leagues i'm not surprised anymore by anything he does i expect it , said phil garner , the astros' manager i expect another cy young and another 20 wins the secret of his longevity is that he prepares for it i 've learned the true definition of discipline with him pettitte and him , and robin yount was that way , they know there s more in their body that s when they become excellent andy pettitte s departure from the yankees to houston after the 2003 season persuaded clemens to unretire and join his hometown astros his command and his ability to work the batter is better now than it was in the seven years i was with the yankees , pettitte said he can do anything with the ball that s what pitching is all about the ability to make a pitch when he has to he s a better pitcher than he ever was he s making more quality pitches than ever but at shea last night , roger clemens just heard quality boos
this time there were no allnight happy hours in front of the bodegas , no batterypowered boom boxes blasting news updates between in da club and hey ya ! no neighborhood tough guys made it their jobs to direct traffic , winking at the girls and waving flashlights , and you can bet nobody will sell tshirts when it is done if mamas tell their babies about the blackout of oughtfive , they will not speak of a whole region plunged into darkness , as in 2003 , nor of a city united , in contrast to the riots of decades before instead , they will tell of a weird , hot , sometimes inspiring , mostly frustrating sunny day on lafayette avenue in fort greene , brooklyn fort greene was one of three neighborhoods in brooklyn and queens most affected by scattered power failures yesterday , said alfonso quiroz , a spokesman for con edison \( the others were corona and sunset park \) the high temperature for the city was 89 , and mr quiroz said about 150 homes and businesses lost power citywide the day before , the demand for electricity broke a con ed record , measuring 12 , 361 megawatts at 4 pm on tuesday a megawatt is enough to power about 1 , 000 homes , and the last time new yorkers used nearly that much was aug 9 , 2001 , a 103degree , 12 , 207megawatt day when 54 people were treated for heat exhaustion and the mets handed out free water at shea stadium peak usage yesterday was 11 , 790 the demand on tuesday drove prices in the city spot market , where companies buy when planning falls short , as high as 1 , 000 for a megawatt hour , compared with a typical range of 50 to 60 , said carol e murphy , a spokeswoman for the new york independent system operator , which administers energy markets prices on the spot market yesterday reached 200 in the city , she said last year , con edison estimated that at the time , it was delivering power to eight million television sets and five million airconditioners , part of a 20 percent increase in demand for electricity in the city and westchester county over the past decade none of those numbers meant much on lafayette avenue yesterday in the midday sunlight , there was little to draw attention to the block between south portland avenue and south elliott place , just a traffic officer in an intersection and a few city workers digging in the street it was easy to overlook the blackout of '05 , but it was still an ordeal , one that fort greene survived in its own way on the block where the lights went out , a restaurant sells a 20 plate of fish with haricots verts , and a bar is named moe s after the tavern on the simpsons between those , a row house is painted with passages from scripture , and the snip snap hair salon and french garment cleaners have not changed for years in a corner deli , the numbers that mattered to ralph jawad were 275 , 24680 and 2 , 30921 those were , in dollars and cents , the amounts on receipts he had signed this week for shipments of milk , cheese and meat , all now garbage it did n't spoil my viagra , did it \? a customer teased mr jawad inside the deli , it felt 10 degrees hotter than it did outside , but a small group of men sat around keeping mr jawad company anyway a teenager in an oversize basketball jersey peeked in he must have been from another block yo , dog , i think the power s out , the teenager said to his friends andre mccleary , 47 , came in with a slice of pizza mr jawad said he had been by the night before , when the lights on the block started to flicker around 10 pm before shutting off for good around 4 am he came down in his drawers he was afraid there was going to be a blackout , mr jawad said mr mccleary set him straight they were n't drawers , they were boxers , he said next door , elaine loney closed up the cleaners just after noon and came to the deli to say goodbye others came in for soda or water mr jawad gave credit to the ones who said they could not get money from cash machines , though he knew the cash machines were working on the next block everybody talked about the blackout this is worse than the big one , said mr mccleary , speaking of 2003 everyone pulled together we 're isolated no one knows about this the officer on the corner came in , and somebody asked him when the lights would come back on never , he said outside , michael gaynor , 50 , was hauling trash to the curb , a job he handles for some building superintendents he seemed undisturbed i never lose power , he said i gain it just east of the block , similar delis and cleaners had power , but just west of it , tom konstantakis sat in the dark on a stool at his academy restaurant he said he had thrown out 3 , 000 worth of food mr quiroz , the con edison spokesman , said that burned wires had caused the power failures and that 21 of the 36 customers on lafayette avenue who had lost power had it back by last evening , but he could not explain the pattern the neighborhood was as puzzled could be something going on , but nobody s saying nothing , said waldo howell , 76 , who was dressed in white from head to toe and sitting in a chair on the sidewalk listening to jazz on a small radio to me , it is strange by afternoon , mr jawad s deli was the only storefront open on the block , save one at trans academy car service , a driver sat in the airconditioning , watching tv on the screen , some joker was getting all worked up about a household cleaner a printed sign on the wall said that by the time you make ends meet , they move the ends my lights are on , said farouk hegazi , 62 , owner of the car service i'm the only one in the neighborhood mr hegazi was at a loss to explain his good fortune , but he did not trust it he was backing up his computer files every two minutes the whole neighborhood is coming in here to charge their phones , mr hegazi said i guess we 're blessed
the rocky marriage that binds the long island power authority and the keyspan energy corporation and , not incidentally , provides electricity to long island will apparently continue for some years to come , sweetened by a promise of a twoyear rate freeze , hope of a modest rate reduction and an agreement for lipa to buy and renovate two of keyspan s aging power plants an announcement on wednesday by gov george e pataki , who seems to have acted as a marriage counselor for the sometimes troubled partners , revealed that the power authority had agreed to let lapse its option to buy keyspan s generating plants on long island at fair market value , a price to be set only after the authority made a commitment to buy the plants that option was written into the deal brokered by mr pataki that established the authority in 1998 to succeed the long island lighting company it was due to expire dec 15 instead , the authority will buy just two power plants in far rockaway and oceanside and use the advantageous financing it can get as a statesponsored public authority to repower them to run much more cleanly and efficiently earlier understandings that the authority would have had to purchase all keyspan plants 5 major plants and about 40 minor ones or none at all seem to have been discarded the agreement sets a price of 75 million for the two plants and gives lipa a year to decide whether to go ahead with the purchases the prospect of repowering the two plants brought expressions of delight from environmentalists and public officials , including senator charles e schumer , democrat of new york they called on the power authority and keyspan to move ahead with the work as soon as possible but at the same time , the deal did not provide for the repowering of the rest of the island s power plants , including the giant northport power station and the aging plants at glenwood landing and port jefferson instead , the two entities agreed merely to start talking next year about plans to repower them the tensions and uncertainties in the lipakeyspan relationship had been blamed for a lack of progress on those plants , and many advocates had hoped that a decision by the power authority either to exercise or forgo the chance to buy them would break the logjam the new agreement extends keyspan s contract to manage the power distribution system on the island , the core of its business relationship with the power authority , until 2013 it had been due to end in 2008 keyspan also agreed to a cut of 34 million , or about 10 percent , in its annual fee under the contract those savings and another 75 million in cash reserves provided by the agreement are to be used by the power authority to defray the elevated fuel costs that have been pushing electric bills up under the agreement , barring a natural disaster like hurricane katrina , the rates that lipa customers pay for electricity are to be kept steady through 2007 an additional 69 million cash payment to lipa by keyspan could be used to lower rates , give rebates to customers and accelerate repayment of 4 billion in debt related to the shuttered shoreham nuclear power plant , which the authority inherited from lilco the authority said it would hold a hearing in january to gather public comments on how to use that money richard m kessel , chairman of the authority , and robert b catell , chairman and chief executive of keyspan , called the agreement a milestone that assured the region a more secure energy future this is a huge win for long island , mr kessel said at a ceremony at the authority s uniondale headquarters , attended by mr pataki , mr catell , other elected officials , environmentalists and keyspan and lipa employees mr kessel said the authority would buy the two plants unless a review found big environmental problems or determined that going ahead would be uneconomic the deal removed clouds of uncertainty for keyspan , an energy giant that grew out of the brooklyn union gas company , and for its employees and investors the agreement assures the company a continuing role as long island s overarching energy provider , not just its gas company now we have an agreement that is really going to solve the problems well into the future , mr catell said at the ceremony now , with this clarification , we know where the power plants are going to wind up the agreement must still be approved by the power authority s trustees , by keyspan s directors and by the offices of the attorney general and by the state comptroller the comptroller , alan g hevesi , has been critical of the power authority s pricing practices he issued a report last monday saying that the authority had improperly sidestepped regulatory review by imposing higher fuel surcharges on customer bills instead of formally changing its base rates the report said that the state public authorities control board , which is responsible for overseeing the authority s finances , was prohibited from allowing lipa s rates to rise even temporarily by more than 25 percent without permission from the new york state public service commission the authority has argued that fuelcharge adjustments on bills are not rate increases in the legal sense mr hevesi s report found that the fuelsurcharge increases imposed by the authority from 2001 to 2004 were nearly twice the national average the surcharges had raised electric bills by 345 percent since march 2001 , the report said mr kessel has defended the surcharges as necessary and appropriate , saying the authority had softened the blow to customers by absorbing some of the higher fuel costs the shoreham debt and high property tax payments also affect the authority s rates , he said photo richard m kessel , at microphone robert b

jim dine is one of the bestknown american artists of the past 40 years and an originator of pop art but in many reviews , critics express frustration with his classicism and lack of originality slick recycler , or words to that effect , recur often in the literature jim dine some drawings at the neuberger museum of art in purchase is a pleasant enough exhibition , corralling some 84 drawings in watercolor , charcoal , enamel , pastel and other media from the 1960 s to the present but it does nothing to persuade us that the artist , now 70 , is anything other than a skillful copier of other images and objects the selection of works offers a sort of mini history of the artist s development , showing off the range of technical process he has used many early drawings , for instance , include collage , while later pieces reveal the artist daringly combining materials and media in unexpected ways but more often than not the content is feeble , and often repetitive classical sculpture , hearts , birds and skulls leaving the images listless and flat there is nothing fresh or even fizzy about them where mr dine excels , i think , is when he allows spontaneity to dictate subject matter and style there are not too many examples of this here , but one that struck me was untitled \( shell \) \( 198184 \) , a messy painting of a shell against a murky , splashy ground somehow mutually repellent values of culture and nature seem aligned , even one cy twombly is a source of comparison for mr dine here , if only insofar as he is one of the few contemporary artists who can consistently infuse drawing with a sense of primal energy mr dine , i think , is capable of such feats , but his tendency is to create more romantic , stylized and often classical imagery , rather than , like mr twombly , allowing his imagination to run wild and free it is what holds him back take , for instance , midsummer , paris \( 2002 \) , a work gracing the cover of the pricey hardbound catalog accompanying the show the choice and application of mixed media is inspired , but the subject matter , a garden scene of some kind with white orchids , is so clich \? even nauseatingly sentimental , that you wonder at its meaning my guess is that there is none mr dine is a conservative artist playing at being avantgarde nudes are also in abundance here , but mostly they are lifeless and stiff there is no intimacy , or no erotic magma bubbling up from within in fact , there is no heat at all they are cold , distant and sterile , which is understandable , given that mr dine is often drawing statues this exhibition coincides with several others of the artist s work in regional galleries , including a brief survey of his prints at the center for contemporary printmaking in norwalk , conn this exhibition , selected by anthony kirk , the center s artistic director and a noted master printmaker , aims to please mostly , it consists of images of flowers , birds and hearts mr dine s prints are among his most accomplished works this is partly because it is a graphic medium and he has a love of drawing , not to mention a great facility , and partly because he has a longstanding passion for the art of printmaking he has worked over the years with many of the world s best master printmakers , and experimented widely with all kinds of printing processes and techniques he knows this craft accomplished prints in many media are here , among them a stark , simple etching and drypoint , cold mountain \( 1994 \) an appealing handcolored lithograph , watercolor zerkall \( 2004 \) and a lush lithograph and woodcut , two hearts in the forest \( 1981 \) but it is all too pretty for my taste , and is mostly decorative work cranked out to feed the market mr dine is among the art world s most prolific printmakers he has produced close to 900 print editions over the course of his career few are masterpieces , but several , like those of hearts and the armless torso of the venus de milo , have earned a toehold in the pantheon of last century s recognized art images the question is will they be remembered \? jim dine some drawings is at the neuberger museum of art , 735 anderson hill road , purchase college , purchase , through jan 8 information \( 914 \) 2516100 or www neuberger org from hearts to flowers jim dine , a print survey is at the center for contemporary printmaking , mathews park , 299 west avenue , norwalk , conn , through nov 18 information \( 203 \) 8997999 or on the web at www contemprints org photos jim dine s cold mountain \( 1994 \) at center for contemporary printmaking , and owl in chelsea \( 2000 \) , right , at neuberger museum
princeton university may have a female president in shirley tilghman , but there has n't been much trickledown effect when it comes to the employment of women there of the 29 tenured and tenuretrack faculty hired at princeton in 2003 , the last year for which data was available , only nine were women \( none were africanamerican or hispanic \) , according to figures culled from a federal database by a graduate student group at yale the data showed that princeton s entire tenured faculty in 2003 was 19 percent female , 3 percent africanamerican and 2 percent hispanic the corresponding numbers for the entire ivy league were 20 percent female , 2 percent africanamerican and 1 percent hispanic the report comes after remarks by harvard university s president , lawrence h summers , that women may lack something innate that prevents them from being top scientists , helping to explain the lower numbers of tenured female professors in response to mr summers , dr tilghman , a molecular geneticist , cowrote an oped article for the boston globe that said , in part , low expectations of women can be as destructive as overt discrimination and may help to explain the disproportionate rate of attrition that occurs among females as they proceed through the academic pipeline so , where are princeton s female professors \? while it might seem that princeton , with its ivycovered prestige , would have a leg up on hiring the best female and minority job applicants , terri harris reed , the university s associate provost for institutional equity , said it was not always that easy you do n't just say , 'princeton , ' and have someone jump , she said there are other factors where do i want to live \? what is there for my spouse \? where do i want to raise my kids \? and most important , do i want to be the only one \? robert strauss

the pads of paper are like little cobblestones that form the path to one of the greatest football minds of his day new england patriots coach bill belichick always has those notebooks with him , waiting for something as mundane as a practice schedule or as complex as an offensive system to be revealed , to spark his interest and demand to be remembered when new england plays host to the indianapolis colts tonight , the game will be viewed by many as a chess match between the most cerebral quarterback in the nfl , peyton manning , and the 53yearold coaching mastermind whose game plans have launched the patriots to three super bowl titles in the past four seasons but even as belichick flourishes at the highest level of his profession , he is engaged in the equivalent of a postgraduate education program , an independent study tour that has taken him from annapolis , md , to gainesville , fla , from a cot in ted marchibroda s hotel room to jimmy johnson s boat at each stop , usually in the offseason and sometimes involving intensive film study , belichick has picked the brain of his host , gleaning bits of wisdom about everything from navy s run offense to johnson s philosophies on drafting and contract negotiations such sessions are common among college coaches , who freely share information about their schemes with coaches whose teams are not on their schedule bear bryant , the legendary alabama coach , went to texas one spring to study the wishbone current college coaches frequently visit virginia tech to learn some of frank beamer s specialteams techniques but belichick s forays are unusual in the nfl limited time in the offseason and heightened paranoia result in most coaches avoiding anything more than the most informal sharing of information he s a perfect example of what we 've let slip away in the image of a coach the job is a teaching job , said giants general manager ernie accorsi , who was the general manager of the cleveland browns when belichick became the head coach there in 1991 bill certainly has a great deal of selfconfidence , but he s got the humility to know that he can always learn from somebody that s successful to me , the smarter you are , the more you want to learn belichick is the son of a longtime coach and scout his father , steve , who worked at the naval academy for years , taught him how to break down film when belichick was 9 years old but in the mid1970 s , when he was earning just 25 a week as a special assistant to the colts , the outside tutorials began in earnest marchibroda , head coach of the baltimore colts at the time , made his headquarters a howard johnson hotel near baltimorewashington airport belichick was not making enough money to rent an apartment , so marchibroda arranged for a cot to be placed in his room the young man with an economics degree from wesleyan and the veteran coach would talk deep into the night about football the gridiron equivalent of a gym rat was born it s just an exchange of information with somebody that you have common ground with , belichick said in an interview during training camp you talk about things that are successful , and sometimes that has an application to what you 're doing when belichick took his first job as a head coach in cleveland , he made an unusual request when he and his staff members went to the scouting combine in indianapolis each assistant was assigned three other teams they were to ask members of those coaching staffs what their practice routines were the point was to see if anybody else had good ideas about how to run practices another summer , belichick put a pile of books on a table in a meeting room each book had something to do with sports or great athletes belichick and his father have enormous libraries of football and sports books , about 500 volumes each , some historical , some technical he assigned two books to each of his coaches , and when they returned to work for the start of training camp , he asked them what they had gotten out of their summer reading book reports for the shoulderpad set he said , 'i think you can learn from others , ' said pat hill , who was a member of belichick s staff in cleveland he is now in his ninth season as head coach at fresno state he added bill is a very good listener he wanted your opinions he did n't want yes guys there s a big difference between listening for what you want to hear and listening to learn when he listens , he has a reason for the questions the questions have helped belichick evolve from the failed cleveland coach who seemed so inept that other executives thought robert k kraft , the owner of the patriots , was crazy to hire him even in recent years , as belichick and the patriots have established a dynasty and a franchise model that is the envy of the nfl , he has continued to seek advice just weeks after the patriots beat the carolina panthers for their second super bowl title , belichick was in baton rouge , la there , he talked defense with nick saban , his former defensive coordinator in cleveland , who was the coach at louisiana state at the time saban now coaches the miami dolphins belichick has known johnson , a twotime super bowl winner in dallas and now an analyst for fox nfl sunday , since the two made some trades while belichick was in cleveland and johnson was in dallas they even spent a part of a kentucky derby day standing along the rail at churchill downs , talking football three years ago , belichick went to the florida keys to visit johnson they fished they drank beer they talked about the draft he was concerned about having too many picks , johnson said in a recent interview i told him , 'picks are like money you ca n't have too much' on draft day , teams will want to trade future picks for one of your picks if you 're not going to use the pick and you do n't want to draft a player , trade it for a future pick he did that year he ended up getting a first and secondround pick that stockpiling of draft picks , even as the patriots were winning , is the cornerstone of the patriots' continuity and it allowed belichick , before the 2004 draft , to trade a secondround pick for running back corey dillon he then used a firstround pick to select defensive tackle vince wilfork but what most impressed johnson was belichick s preparation for their conversation belichick remembered some of johnson s drafts with dallas better than he did he knew that one year johnson had drafted three offensive linemen none of them made the cowboys' roster , but all of them landed with other teams two years ago , belichick returned to south florida and to johnson s boat this time their talk centered on contracts cornerback ty law wanted a new one and was threatening to hold out i said 'you 've got to hardline it once you start redoing it , you 'll have everybody on your team in your office' johnson recalled i said 'do n't think everybody is going to be happy but if you hold your line on one , it will prevent three or four problems down the road' that remains the patriots' guiding economic philosophy quarterback tom brady and others have accepted what many believe to be belowmarket deals to stay in new england belichick did not visit during this offseason , but jacksonville coach jack del rio called johnson and said he had heard about belichick s visits and wanted in two years ago , belichick spent two days watching film of the running game at navy he had an appreciation for how a program with limited resources could produce what he considers one of the best running games in college football when he told me he wanted to come , i laughed and said , 'yeah , i can see tom brady running the option , ' navy coach paul johnson said i think he was looking for things we do off the zone play , or blocking schemes that he could incorporate into his system the guy is a brilliant guy who knows what he was looking for \? i think he s intrigued with the option game perhaps that explains what belichick and his quarterbacks coach , josh mcdaniels , were doing in gainesville during the offseason belichick met with florida coach urban meyer while scouting his players , and they spoke about meyer s spreadoption offense it was highly successful in meyer s two seasons at utah and is all the rage in college football meyer and his offensive coordinator , dan mullen , were hosts to dozens of high school and college coaches eager to learn the highscoring system the only nfl coaches to visit were from the patriots mullen and mcdaniels spent hours watching tape and drawing plays on a board of particular interest , mullen said , was the intermediate passing game with an empty backfield they discussed different pass routes , especially on plays using five wide receivers and plays that have an option route i 've actually seen them do some of the stuff we talked about , mullen said you 're not designing the option to get tom brady to run the ball you 're designing the option to cause issues for a defense , to get him to read the defense and then pitch it to another guy because he s a great decision maker , he could probably run the option belichick said it s not like we 're going to do a wholesale change to that system are there plays we might use \? sure accorsi , the giants general manager , paraphrased a quotation from knute rockne , saying amos alonzo stagg invented everything there is in football the rest of us are just recycling it it is fitting then that belichick now has his spot in the coaching pantheon with rockne and stagg your ego ca n't be so big that you 're not going to borrow from other people , johnson , the navy coach , said the best coaches are a move or two ahead of the other guys i think that s the kind of guy he is

saying that the economy was still getting stronger , the federal reserve raised its benchmark shortterm interest rate again yesterday and gave investors reason to think that it would continue lifting rates through the end of the year the fed lifted the rate to 35 percent , from 325 percent , the 10th increase since last summer , as the economy has recovered from recession and its long hangover the change in the benchmark which directly affects many credit card and business loans and usually influences mortgage rates though with a lag had been expected but the fed s ratesetting committee also tweaked the language in its public statement after the meeting to note that economic growth had picked up aggregate spending , despite high energy prices , appears to have strengthened since late winter , the statement said , and labor market conditions continue to improve gradually the fed now seems to be in a race against the economy s gathering strength , with policy makers hoping that they did not keep interest rates low for a long enough time to ignite inflation many wall street economists are growing worried about that possibility , while others especially on the left say that job and wage growth remain too weak for serious inflation fears after president bush met with his economic team yesterday at his ranch in crawford , tex , he sidestepped a question about whether higher interest rates could slow the economy , saying that energy and health care were his top concerns the chairman of the council of economic advisers , ben bernanke , speaking with reporters , said inflation is well contained , under control the core inflation rate over the last year is about 2 percent , and i see inflation remaining well contained going forward the fed reiterated that it planned to raise shortterm rates at a measured pace , a term that is widely thought to mean that it would continue to move in quarterpoint increments investors expect the benchmark rate , the federal funds rate , to reach 425 percent by the end of the year , based on the price of a futures contract that tracks fed actions that would require the fed to lift the rate at each of its three remaining meetings in 2005 in the spring , when economic growth looked weaker than it has recently , investors were betting that the key rate would end the year at 375 percent a policy mistake may have been made , said laurence h meyer , a former fed governor and now vice chairman of macroeconomic advisers , a forecasting firm they may have lingered too long at interest rates that will eventually cause a surge in inflation the housing boom , a recovery in business investment and strong consumer spending have kept the economy growing at a steady pace despite oil prices that have reached the highest levels since the early 1980 s , adjusted for inflation on tuesday morning , stocks rose slightly , after a labor department report showed that productivity growth had slowed less than expected in the second quarter , and the market held onto its gains after the fed s announcement in the afternoon the standard poor s 500stock index closed at 1 , 23138 , up a little more than 8 points in a sign that investors might have expected the fed to express more concern about inflation than it did , the interest rate on the 10year treasury note slipped to 439 percent , from 442 percent late monday in its statement , the fed used many of the same words that it did last month to describe its attitude toward prices core inflation has been relatively low in recent months and longerterm inflation expectations remain well contained , it said , but pressures on inflation have stayed elevated the fact that longterm interest rates , including those on mortgages , remain lower than they were a year ago , when the fed started raising rates , has perplexed many analysts , and the causes are not clear this has made the fed s job more difficult , preventing the rate increases from slowing the economy as they typically do in recent weeks , longterm rates which are set by daytoday trading in the bond market have risen somewhat , which probably took some pressure off fed officials to issue a stronger statement about inflation risks the benchmark interest rate now exceeds inflation , which has been running about 25 percent a year , by a small amount in the language of the fed , that means the rate is still below the neutral level and is still pushing the economy ahead instead of holding it back the fed chairman , alan greenspan , has declined to say publicly just what the neutral level is we do n't know what neutrality is until we get there , he told congress last year many forecasters say it is in the neighborhood of 4 percent , which is why they expect the fed to continue raising its benchmark for the rest of the year in previous cycles , though , the fed struggled to avoid overreaching , and raising or cutting rates more than looked necessary in hindsight at times later , it had to reverse course the spooky part is that greenspan and others have said they do n't know what neutral is , said robert j barbera , chief economist at itg , but they 'll know it when they see it a fairer thing to say is probably that they do n't know what neutral is , but they 'll know it when they 've passed it the labor market is also complicating the fed s attempt to understand the economy s direction wages for most workers have recently been rising no faster than inflation , often a sign that the economic growth is not healthy enough to set off inflation new technologies and the movement of some jobs to lowwage nations seem to be holding back wage and price increases but another possibility is that pay increases will come with time raises often lag behind job growth by months or even years , and some economists say that the fed should continue increasing interest rates to prevent wages , and inflation , from spiraling over the next year politically , they 're not going to come out and say , 'we do n't want to see unemployment come down any more , ' maury n harris , chief united states economist at ubs , said , referring to fed officials but i think what they would like to see is an economy that grows just fast enough to keep unemployment stable in its report yesterday , the labor department said that unit labor costs , a measure of pay for each unit of output , rose 43 percent over the last year , the fastest growth since 2000 but most of the increase occurred late in 2004 in the second quarter of 2005 , unit labor costs rose at an annual pace of just 13 percent using the same words it did at its last meeting , the fed called productivity growth robust mr bush praised the economy over all , saying that job growth was strong and that trade agreements were opening new markets but his advisers struggled to explain why , if the economy was improving , public confidence remained shaky , as numerous polls show it does allan b hubbard , director of the national economic council , said that most people in terms of their personal finances , feel very good about the economy at the same time , there is unease about the economy in general , mr hubbard said none of us are comfortable paying 250 per gallon when we go to fill up our cars with gas and , he said , we are a nation at war both mr hubbard and mr bernanke said that health care costs were a major topic of discussion at the ranch meeting , but declined to specify what if any policies the president intended to pursue to address them
the orientalist solving the mystery of a strange and dangerous life by tom reiss illustrated 433 pp random house 2595 an entertaining species of biography might take the generic subtitle but did he really exist \? the benchmark is a j a symons s 1934 book , the quest for corvo , where a literary gumshoe tailed the pederastic \( and quite interesting \) writer frederick rolfe , baron corvo but other examples are the hermit of peking , in which hugh trevorroper exposed sir edmund backhouse , another intellectual impostor and sexual adventurer and bernard wasserstein s richly comical secret lives of trebitsch lincoln \( by turns hungarian jew , british mp , buddhist convert and chinese gunrunner \) in each case , the biographer s task is not just telling a life story but peeling away the layers of myth and mendacity that cocoon these fabulists although kurban said may not have reached such extremes of fantasy , he set a high standard during his short but amazing interwar career as a writer he became famous throughout much of europe his novel ali and nino , a romance set in azerbaijan at the time of the russian revolution , was a best seller in 1937 , and is read to this day when tom reiss went to report from baku some years ago , an iranian friend recommended it to him as better than any guidebook its author also published a number of books as essad bey , beginning with blood and oil in the orient , written when he was only 24 , and including biographies of the last czar and of stalin but who was he \? that question set reiss off sleuthing , and the orientalist is the result it might have been called the quest for kurban while the full answer is anything but simple , he was born lev nussimbaum in baku in 1905 , when the city was enjoying its first oil boom half of the world s supply passed through its port around half a century earlier lev s grandfather had probably migrated to the caucasus from the jewish pale within the russian empire , and lev s father , abraham , had made a small fortune out of oil one of lev s first pieces of mythmongering was to insist that his mother was not jewish \( as she doubtless was \) but a declassed aristocrat he was altogether a romantic snob , who strongly identified with nicholas ii \( we have the same character \) in blood and oil lev would describe himself at 13 using a machine gun during the brutal civil war that followed the revolution that seems unlikely , but there is little doubt father and son escaped across turkestan and persia and endured many privations before returning to baku but soon the bolsheviks and their dreaded cheka were in control there , and the pair escaped once more , this time to constantinople although reiss s book is intermittently enthralling , he suffers from the notorious author s inability to let go of anything he has learned numerous digressions are more detailed than relevant , on everything from the origins of the shiitesunni scission to the decay of old turkey \( i did n't know much about the ottoman empire when i first returned from baku , he says in his chatty way , but when i got back to my apartment in new york , the perfect source presented itself to me \) not all these asides have the ring of authority the projewish climate of aristocratic england in the 19th century is not a phrase many historians would be keen to use , and the czar and his family were killed at yekaterinburg in 1918 , not 1917 still , these are minor flaws , and the action is so gripping that reiss is soon pulled back to spinning his yarn after moving to berlin , lev finished his schooling among the russian migr s there , when his friends included elena nabokov but his first really successful reinvention was to shed his russianness and become a german author this kind of transmogrification was not so rare in the fullness of time , after all , elena s brother vladimir would become a great american writer and in that slightly crazy milieu , namechanging , or guising , was almost commonplace at any rate , there now emerged essad bey , a turbaned , daggerwielding writer , an azeri muslim , who began contributing to literary papers and turning out books whatever his veracity , there is no doubting lev s ability , precocity and sheer prolificity after blood and oil came half a dozen more very successful books in the next four years , at least 14 in his short life , as well as a great quantity of journalism less productive authors may be amused to hear his agent begging his client not to publish too many more books his performance as essad was not just shtick , and one chapter , on jewish orientalism , is far from an irrelevant digression reiss gives a fascinating examination of something that sprang up in the early 19th century , a romantic jewish tradition of identifying with the east it encompassed everything from the cult of the mystic orient found in benjamin disraeli s preposterous novel tancred , to the quite extraordinary architectural fashion for building synagogues in a supposedly jewishmuslim or moorish style , often of the most outrageous extravagance \( i do n't know if reiss has ever seen it , but there is no more astonishing case than the wildly overthetop synagogue in liverpool \) in this context reiss connects nussimbaumessad with some of the more exotic zionists , who envisaged not so much a european colony on the eastern shores of the mediterranean as a reconnection of the jews with their asian heritage and yet if the jewish boy from baku who wanted to be a sheik of araby fit into this pattern , he never completely shed his origins , not in the way witnessprotection schemes are meant to arrange essad bey was less a total change of identity than a stage name , like calling yourself cary grant or ed mcbain as a career move by the early 1930 s lev was flirting with all sorts of harebrained zealots and crackpots , some on the far right but if he had forgotten that he was a jew , they had n't in late 1933 , after hitler had come to power , lev sailed for new york , maybe who knows if anything was for certain in his case \? with a view to one more transformation , into an american instead , he returned to europe in 1935 , only to learn that he had been expelled from the german writers union \( no specific reason was given , but none needed to be \) and that his wife had left him he went to vienna and , in the same strange pattern of paradox and denial , wrote allah is great , celebrating the muslim resurgence of the age the book could equally have borrowed shelley s title , the revolt of islam , or george antonius s arab awakening and to make it odder still , its coauthor was wolfgang von weisl , an associate of vladimir jabotinsky in the ultranationalist revisionist zionist movement now lev moved to italy and desperately tried to ingratiate himself with mussolini s regime , even offering , with what reiss calls almost suicidal chutzpah , to write a biography of il duce but his timing had finally gone all wrong mussolini had just passed his racial laws in an opportunistic attempt to please hitler and lev nussimbaum s jewish identity was officially denounced he managed to hide himself away in positano , the pretty town south of naples , pretending to be an american maybe the new order would have caught up with him his father disappeared into the hellish darkness and was probably murdered at treblinka but disease came first raynaud s syndrome , similar in effect to gangrene , killed him in 1942 , at the age of only 36 whether this astounding and bitter story has any moral i am not sure , but it defies the old phrase stranger than fiction it s just as well that reiss did n't write his quest for kurban as a novel who would have believed a word of it \? geoffrey wheatcroft s books include the controversy of zion jewish nationalism , the jewish state and the unresolved jewish dilemma , and the forthcoming strange death of tory england
east rutherford , nj , sept 18 perhaps that 3410 victory over denver last week was an aberration , a fleeting feelgood moment from what may still be a slog of a season for the miami dolphins perhaps the offense could not have hoped to duplicate its week 1 balance against the jets' run defense perhaps there is still too much that is new about the rebuilt dolphins to think that they can challenge the american football conference s power teams in coach nick saban s first season linebacker zach thomas is buying none of that after the jets beat the dolphins , 177 , capitalizing on 10 miami penalties , thomas was adamant that things would be different the misery of last year s 412 season is over , gone with the former coach dave wannstedt this performance with the dolphins running for only 66 yards , and with the defense committing critical penalties on the jets' first touchdown drive and on their last one is merely a snapshot from what will be an extended tableau of improvement for the dolphins , thomas said but if the victory over the broncos provided optimism for what the dolphins might become , then this loss provided a reality check miami is still a team struggling to right itself , struggling even , thomas admitted , to find its intensity in a road game against a heated rival this ai n't the same old dolphins , i promise you that , thomas said we were inconsistent we 're going to get better i just know this , we 're going to be a lot better when the jets come to play us once we get clicking on defense , we 're going to be real good today , we were off and we were n't very good what they were against the jets was wildly inconsistent , stringing together long drives that stalled , and pushing the jets backward , only to allow them to leap forward with the help of penalties on the first drive of the game , the jets were backed up to their 15yard line on thirdand15 but miami safety lance schulters was called for defensive pass interference , at a cost of 16 yards the jets scored their first touchdown on that drive in the fourth quarter , an unnecessaryroughness penalty turned a 16yard gain by receiver laveranues coles into a 28yard pickup , to the miami 11 still , the dolphins' defense , as it has done for years , kept miami in the game , holding the jets to 271 total yards and keeping them scoreless on three consecutive drives in the third quarter the dolphins were still down by only a field goal early in the fourth quarter but the offense , so effective against the broncos , could never regain the rhythm it had in its first drive of the game the dolphins had marched to the jets' 3yardline , but the usually reliable olindo mare missed a 21yard fieldgoal attempt wide left a poor snap threw off his timing the dolphins managed just 235 yards of offense jets defensive end john abraham taunted and tested the dolphins' offensive line all day , and miami s inability to establish the running game kept it in longyardage situations the result was abysmal the dolphins were 4 of 14 29 percent on third downs a typical sequence from the third quarter the dolphins had thirdand2 from their 30 when a false start forced them into a passing situation on thirdand7 abraham batted down gus frerotte s thirddown pass attempt at the line of scrimmage you can handle secondand8 and chip away at it , frerotte said but when it s secondand15 , secondand20 , those things hurt you when we have penalties on offense , it s not very good when we 're in thirdand10 , all we can do is throw in those situations we 've got to run the ball for a team that is rebuilding , there are supposed to be plenty of days like this the afc east is one of the most competitive divisions in the league and in that , thomas takes some solace the whole division is 11 , he said next week we 're coming out with some intensity even at practice , even at home we 're going to be a lot better team i'm telling you , we 're going to get better for the dolphins this season , that might be enough
boca raton , fla it was saturday night at the palace 20 , a huge megaplex here designed in an ornate , mediterranean style and suggesting the ambience of a las vegas hotel moviegoers by the hundreds were keeping the valet parkers busy , pulling into the portecochere beneath the enormous chandelierstyle lamps entering the capacious lobby , some of them dropped off their small children in a supervised playroom and proceeded to a vast concession stand for a quick meal of pizza or popcorn shrimp before the show others , who had arrived early for their screening of , say , wedding crashers or the dukes of hazzard their reservedseat tickets , ordered online and printed out at home , in hand entered through a separate door they paid 18 twice the regular ticket price \( though it included free popcorn and valet service \) and took an escalator upstairs to the bar and restaurant , where the monkfish was excellent and no one under 21 was allowed those who did n't want a whole dinner , or arrived too late for a sitdown meal , lined up at the special concession stand , where the menu included shrimp cocktail and sushi and half bottles of white zinfandel and pinot noir as it got close to curtain time , they took their food and drink into one of the adjoining six theater balconies , all with plush wide seats and small tables with sunken cup holders during the film , the most irritating sound was the clink of ice in real glasses not your image of moviegoing \? pretty soon it might be at a time when movie attendance is flagging , when home entertainment is offering increasing competition and when the largest theater chains regal entertainment , amc entertainment \( which has recently announced a merger with loews cineplex \) and cinemark are focused on shifting from film to digital projection , a handful of smaller companies with names like muvico theaters , rave motion pictures and national amusements are busy rethinking what it means to go to the movie theater the palace , which was opened five years ago by muvico , a chain of distinctive megaplex theaters based in south florida , remains pretty close to the gold standard , in terms of customer amenities in firstrun theaters but the competition is growing in the age of the megaplex , after all , said hamid hashemi , muvico s president , everyone gets pretty much the same movies and pretty much the same quality prints so what makes someone pass up one location and go to another one \? he added it s how you package the experience in other words , you have to offer more than a movie it s the folks who create a compelling value proposition for consumers who will be the survivors in our business , said paul glantz , whose company , emagine entertainment , runs three megaplex theaters in michigan , all featuring full bars and allowing customers to take their drinks to their seats in my book , the muvicos and raves of the world represent the future of moviegoing in this country , said mr glantz , who added unabashedly that the liquor license saved his business they 're giving people a real reason to leave their home and be entertained certainly , movie theaters have been experimenting with amenities since the advent of airconditioning \( it s cool inside ! \) but since 1995 , when amc opened the first megaplex , the 24screen grand in dallas , the movie landscape has been reconfigured and for the larger chains , the sheer size of the enterprise regal now has nearly 600 theaters in 40 states housing more than 6 , 600 screens mitigates against chainwide service innovations some conveniences have been tried and kept rewards programs for frequent moviegoers , for example but experiments with restaurants and lounges have been largely discarded as inconsistent with what dick westerling , a regal spokesman , calls the core business , meaning the showing of movies thus , the improvements regal and amc and the other behemoths have concentrated on involve the viewing experience digital sound , stadium seating and armrest cup holders and though most of them have tried regional , luxury and specialty items at the concession stands , too , as john fithian , president of the national association of theater owners , put it , we 've experimented and experimented , and people basically want popcorn and soda and candy they go to the movies to escape their houses , mr fithian continued , and they like to escape their healthy diets , too so the tinkering in terms of customer service has been mostly in the hands of small theater owners the first firstrun theater to offer alcohol was the commodore , a onescreen palace in portsmouth , va and according to in focus , a trade magazine published by the theater owners association , by 1997 only 14 theaters allowed patrons to drink , either in the lobby or their seats at the beginning of this year , the magazine said , the number was 270 , most operated by independent owners or small chains places like the alamo drafthouse in austin , tex , and two small chains in northern new england , chunky s and smitty s , seat customers at tables and offer different versions of dinner and a movie the megaplexes run by rave , the texasbased chain , feature stateoftheart video arcades pacific theaters in california is especially proud of the arclight in hollywood , a stateoftheart multiplex with reserved seating , a cafe bar and screenings restricted to adults 21 and older , not to mention highend concessions and ushers who will actually urge chatterbox patrons to pipe down the massachusettsbased national amusements , which runs 86 theaters in the united states , mostly in the east , has built two new theaters under a new brand name , the bridge located in philadelphia and los angeles , they include a bar and lounge and a limitedmenu restaurant \( though the theaters are not yet licensed for customers to bring alcohol into the auditoriums \) , as well as other amenities like a reading room , a concierge desk to help with postmovie dinner reservations and taxis , and live entertainment in the lobby they create what i call an upscale moviegoing experience for the masses , said shari redstone , the president of national amusements some of these amenities , including the bar and a lobby pianist , are included at many of the company s other theaters , in a package called cinema de lux , which will be offered , ms redstone said , in every theater the company builds from now on like most chains , national amusements is tinkering with its concessions menu ms redstone seemed especially excited about a new item on the menu , baby carrots , to be served with ranch dressing for patrons who are n't so interested in the tubofpopcorn , tureenofcoke convention she has also started special programs , like classic old movies for seniors , and alternative entertainment , like live comedy and sporting events , for instance , showing red sox games on the big screen in their new england theaters , and serving beer and hot dogs what i'm really trying to become is a community center , ms redstone said the exciting part is that we 're reinventing our business by giving people more reasons to go to our buildings but muvico may be the most ambitious of them all muvico theaters are huge and , melding the throwback idea of the glamorous movie palace to the contemporary fixation on theme parks , all designed according to grandiose themes the 1950 s , for example , or ancient egypt between 50 , 000 and 60 , 000 moviegoers a week pass through the 4 , 600seat paradise 24 , visible from i75 indavie , fla , which was constructed to look like an ancient egyptian temple , columns and decorative hieroglyphics included the palace is a homage to the fauxmediterranean designs of the architect addison mizner , who more or less built boca raton but what is even more distinct about them is that they do not disdain an audience that many theaters already seem to have dismissed adults who have adult predilections muvico theaters offer ways for a price , of course for moviegoers to escape the crying babies , giggling teenagers , rude patrons , cellphones and inferior food that keep many people from venturing to the theater even without the popcorn , it s definitely worth the money , said david raphael , a salesman from boca raton who , with his wife , judy , was enjoying a glass of wine at the upstairs bar at the palace before a screening of wedding crashers we pretty much go here whenever we go to the movies and we pass other theaters to get here none of this , of course , changes the fact that hollywood movies seem to skew younger and younger every year we 're a productdriven business , and we do n't have any control over the product , unfortunately , mr hashemi said but in all our customer surveys , the unifying factor is 'get us away from the kids' it s the exact opposite of what we 're led to believe in this business there are 12 muvico megaplexes now , in tennessee and maryland as well as florida , all with expanded concessions and professional child supervision , some with full bars six other theaters are in varying stages of construction , including a 26screen megamegaplex reprising the egyptian theme that is scheduled to open in 2006 or 2007 adjacent to the meadowlands sports complex in new jersey and will include a 400seat bar and restaurant , a rooftop terrace , complete with an outdoor screen , and a helipad to facilitate vip access asked if he had ambitions to go nationwide with muvico theaters , mr hashemi did everything but say yes the company is negotiating in chicago , he said , and exploring in los angeles and manhattan \? if the real estate is there , we 'll be there , he predicted in the meantime , he said , they believe they can be profitable in markets with populations of 600 , 000 or more within a 20minute drive of the theater we can build two buildings in each of the top 50 markets in the country , he said after a pause , mr hashemi was asked if the spread of theaters with adult luxuries might eventually result in more movies aimed at adults he laughed i do n't think we could ever build them fast enough , he said
washington , june 3 a military inquiry has found that guards or interrogators at the guant namo bay detention center in cuba kicked , stepped on and splashed urine on the koran , in some cases intentionally but in others by accident , the pentagon said on friday the splashing of urine was among the cases described as inadvertent it was said to have occurred when a guard urinated near an air vent and the wind blew his urine through the vent into a detainee s cell the detainee was given a fresh uniform and a new koran , and the guard was reprimanded and assigned to guard duty that kept him from contact with detainees for the remainder of his time at guant namo , according to the military inquiry the investigation into allegations that the koran had been mishandled also found that in one instance detainees' korans were wet because guards on the night shift had thrown water balloons on the cellblock in another case , a twoword obscenity was written in english on the inside cover of a koran , but investigators could not determine whether a guard or detainee had written it last week , the head of the investigation , brig gen jay w hood , commander of the guant namo joint task force , announced at the pentagon that his preliminary findings had uncovered five cases in which the koran was mishandled at the prison , but he refused to provide details in releasing those details in a final report on friday , general hood emphasized that any abuse of the koran was unusual and that the military had gone to great lengths to be sensitive to the detainees' religious faiths , including issuing more than 1 , 600 korans at the detention center mishandling a koran at guant namo bay is a rare occurrence , general hood said in a statement released by the military s southern command mishandling of a koran here is never condoned the investigation was started about three weeks ago after newsweek magazine published an article asserting that a separate inquiry by the military was expected to find that a koran had been flushed down a toilet at the detention center the magazine later retracted the article , but the assertion led to violence in the muslim world that left at least 17 people dead general hood said last week that there was no credible evidence to substantiate the claim that a koran had ever been flushed down a toilet at the prison the final report released on friday said that four of the five incidents took place after january 2003 , after written procedures governing the handling of the koran had been put in place that contradicted an account provided last thursday by general hood , who was asked directly whether all five of the incidents had taken place before january 2003 , and replied not all of them one of them occurred since then a spokesman for the task force , capt jeffrey weir , said in a telephone interview that he could not explain general hood s comments last week maybe he misspoke , captain weir said i'm not sure why he would have put it that way the military released the findings of the investigation about 7 15 pm , eastern time , well after the broadcasts of the network television evening news programs a pentagon spokesman , bryan whitman , denied that the military was trying to bury bad news late on a friday night , a tactic often used by government agencies it was completed and we try not to hold these things after their reviews are completed , mr whitman said in a telephone interview military policy acknowledges that some muslims consider a nonmuslim touching the koran as a desecration the southern command policy of koran handling is serious , respectful and appropriate , said lawrence di rita , the pentagon spokesman , who was traveling with defense secretary donald h rumsfeld at a security conference in singapore the hood inquiry would appear to affirm that policy the report said investigators had examined nine alleged incidents in which the koran was mishandled , either intentionally or unintentionally , and confirmed five of them four involved guards at the detention center one involved an interrogator according to the military s statement on friday , this is what happened in the five confirmed incidents of koran abuse in february 2002 , a detainee complained during an interrogation that guards at camp xray had kicked the koran of a detainee in a neighboring cell four or five days earlier , the inquiry s report said the interrogator reported the complaint on feb 27 , and confirmed that the guards were aware of the complaint the report said there was no evidence of any investigation into the incident , and investigators did not say why they believed it was credible or who might have been responsible on july 25 , 2003 , a contract interrogator apologized to a detainee for stepping on the detainee s koran in an earlier interrogation the detainee accepted the apology and agreed to tell other detainees and ask them to stop disruptive behavior caused by the incident the interrogator was later fired for a pattern of unacceptable behavior , an inability to follow direct guidance and poor leadership , the military statement said on aug 15 , 2003 , two detainees complained to one set of guards that their korans were wet because guards on the night shift had tossed water balloons on the cellblock the complaints were recorded in the cellblock s log , but there was no indication that the incident was ever investigated investigators described the guards' conduct as clearly inappropriate but said it did not cause any disturbance among detainees less than a week later , on aug 21 , a detainee who spoke conversational english complained that someone had written a twoword obscenity in english in his englishversion koran the complaint was recorded in an electronic log it is possible , the military s statement said , that a guard committed this act it is equally possible that the detainee wrote in his own koran on march 25 , 2005 , a detainee complained to the guards that urine had come through an air vent in his cellblock , and splashed him and his koran as he lay near the vent a guard who had left his observation post to urinate outside acknowledged that he was to blame he had urinated near the vent , and the wind blew it into the vent , from which it splashed into the cell the senior guard on duty immediately relieved the guard , and ordered that the detainee receive a fresh uniform and a new koran the guard was reprimanded and assigned to duty where he had no contact with detainees for the remainder of his assignment at the detention center general hood s report found 10 other alleged incidents , 7 involving guards and 3 involving interrogators , where the military personnel accidentally touched the koran , touched a koran within the scope of their regular duties or did not touch the koran at all the inquiry concluded that none of these events involved mishandling of the koran , but that some were clearly alarming to detainees , including a case in late 2002 in which an unidentified marine , during an interrogation , was said to have squatted down in front of a detainee in an aggressive manner in the process , the report said , the marine unintentionally squatted down over the detainee s koran , and this provoked a visible reaction from the detainee the report also found 15 incidents in which detainees had mishandled the koran the military s statement said the investigation had examined 31 , 000 documents , both on paper and electronically classified and unclassified computer drives used by task force personnel and legal documents and news articles for any mention of possible abuses of the koran general hood concluded that the current policy regarding the handling of the koran was appropriate , but the military statement said that some additional minor changes , which it did not describe , were under review correction june 7 , 2005 , tuesday a frontpage article on saturday about the release of the final military report on the mishandling of the koran by guards or interrogators at the guant namo bay detention center in cuba gave an incorrect surname in some copies for the general who headed the investigation he is brig gen jay w hood , not wood
on the day george steinbrenner was born , a yankees team with nine future hall of famers lost a holiday doubleheader in washington seventyfive years later , another yankees team loaded with star power played one game that seemed like two in the longest nineinning game in the majors this season , the yankees outlasted the baltimore orioles , 138 , yesterday at yankee stadium steinbrenner was not there , staying home in florida with his family after the yankees needed 4 hours and 12 minutes to put away the victory , he might have needed a few more candles on his birthday cake i'm sure it was n't one he enjoyed watching , manager joe torre said none of us did the end of the game , i'm sure , put a smile on his face held scoreless for five innings after an early 60 lead , the yankees erupted for seven runs in the eighth the rally erased a baltimore comeback that had put the yankees down by two , and it brought back cozy memories of seasons not so tense we 're coming back the way we used to , said bernie williams , whose tworun bloop single over first base scored the goahead run in the eighth i think it s a great sign of good things to come the yankees \( 4239 \) have won five of their last seven games , coming from behind four times and winning the other game , 10 it is a dangerous way to play , and emblematic of the yankees' pitching problems tanyon sturtze made an emergency start yesterday because the yankees had no viable replacement for the injured carl pavano the three relievers who pitched after sturtze were pitching for class aaa columbus two weeks ago sturtze lasted three and twothirds innings , allowing four runs scott proctor , wayne franklin and jason anderson followed him , and the mound looked like a petri dish for torre the yankees are experimenting with inhouse bullpen help before the july 31 nonwaiver trading deadline , and yesterday torre got a closeup look at the specimens the results were inconclusive at best proctor walked in a run , then retired four hitters in a row before allowing a homer to jay gibbons franklin struck out brian roberts with a man on second to escape a jam in the sixth , but he gave up two runs in the seventh anderson \( 10 \) earned the victory , but not without allowing a goahead tworun double to luis matos in the seventh torre restored order in the ninth , using mariano rivera to finish it we ca n't rely on games like this on a regular basis , torre said we need to pitch effectively and control the game better than we did today as strange as it was for the yankees , the game was just as bizarre for the orioles their closer , the allstar bj ryan , threw more pitches than their starter , bruce chen orioles manager lee mazzilli summoned ryan in a save situation in the eighth inning , which he had not done all season ryan \( 12 \) failed , allowing five runs \( four earned \) on three hits and three walks , one intentional it was the 10th loss in 12 games for the orioles , who lead the yankees for second place in the american league east by just a game and a half but mazzilli , after meeting with his players , said he was proud you 're down six runs to the yankees in the second inning and you come back and score eight runs in this ballpark , he said to reporters it s pretty damn good the bullpen did the job they held them right where they were the orioles might have won handily if not for chen gary sheffield smoked a threerun homer to left off him in the first inning , and hideki matsui added a basesempty blast in the second inning , jason giambi crushed the first of his two homers into the third deck in right it was 60 after two innings , but after a homer by roberts in the third , sturtze s stamina ran out in the fourth a hit batter , a walk and a single brought in one run , and a twoout walk loaded the bases for the no 9 hitter , sal fasano sturtze walked him with his 82nd pitch , making it 63 and bringing in proctor from the bullpen i just wanted to go as hard as i could as long as i could , sturtze said that ended up being three and twothirds that s all i had with the yankees leading , 65 , in the sixth , torre called for franklin , a lefthander so obscure that sturtze admitted he did not know his first name until he took the mound franklin used a backdoor slider to strike out his first hitter , roberts , and he punched the air on his way to the dugout you do n't want to make a mistake to the league s leading hitter , franklin said , referring to roberts and his 358 average that s why i got a little emotional right there it was a onerun game but the orioles quickly tied it in the seventh melvin mora doubled and scored on a oneout single by rafael palmeiro anderson relieved franklin , walked his first hitter and gave up matos s tworun double on a curveball to put the orioles ahead , 86 scoreless off three middle relievers , the yankees had better luck off steve kline and ryan giambi led off the eighth with a homer , and after two singles , an intentional walk and a sacrifice bunt , ryan walked alex rodriguez on a 32 count to force in the tying run every game has a moment , and i knew that was it right there , rodriguez said strikeout or popup , we might lose the game instead , williams followed the walk by looping a single just out of reach onto the grass near the foul line in shallow right two runs scored to put the yankees ahead , 108 , and they piled it on from there sometimes it s better to be lucky than good , williams said he was referring to his hit , but he could have been talking about the team the yankees were not exactly good , but they had more staying power than their sinking opponent , and they gave their owner the only thing he really cares about a victory

americans in the eastern half of the country will be able to breathe a little easier in years to come as a result of two developments in washington this week first , a senate committee pretty much killed president bush s clear skies initiative , a deeply flawed rewrite of the country s basic clean air laws it would have done more for the industries that pollute the air \( and helped write the bill \) than for the people who breathe it the committee s action was swiftly followed by a new rule from the environmental protection agency aimed at significantly reducing the smog , soot and acid rain caused by power plant emissions in the east and midwest the agency had held the new rule in reserve in case congress could not agree on clear skies known as the clean air interstate rule , it is intended to reduce emissions of nitrogen oxides , which help create smog , by 60 percent over 10 years , and of sulfur dioxide , which creates soot , by more than 70 percent both contribute to acid rain , a scourge of northeastern forests like the adirondacks clear skies had essentially the same targets and timetables but clear skies would also have gutted several vital clean air act provisions that eastern states in particular have found useful in combating windblown pollution from other states one of these provisions requires power plants to install stateoftheart pollution controls whenever they significantly upgrade plants another allows states to sue each other over windblown pollution the new rule , in other words , has all of the upside of clear skies with none of the downside it could have been stronger but there is no reason that it cannot be strengthened in the future , and state officials who are ultimately responsible under the clean air act for providing their residents with healthy air still have access to the various regulatory mechanisms that mr bush s clear skies proposals would have taken away the next piece of news on the clean air front is likely to be much less cheery for the environmental community than this week s news the epa is scheduled to unveil on wednesday its longawaited rule on mercury , a highly toxic pollutant that has been found in fish because previous administrations largely ducked the mercury issue , this will be the first effort to regulate mercury emissions from power plants , which are responsible for about 48 of the 113 tons produced in the united states every year environmentalists are sure to argue , however , that the rule fails to control local depositions of mercury , does not exploit proven technologies that could lead to even greater reductions and , in general , is biased toward industry this much is certain the clean air wars , which have been a reliable feature of the political landscape in washington ever since the original clean air act was passed more than 34 years ago , will continue , in the courts if not in congress
being the governor of new jersey is such a good job that two people are spending staggering amounts of their own money to land it neither one , however , seems to be able to get people to like him as the zillionaire candidates douglas r forrester and jon s corzine sink deeper into legal , and legalistic , explanations of the funny spots in their personal finances , their approval ratings in recent polls are landing in the range of poor to mediocre one poll shows that nearly half of new jersey voters wish that someone else were on the ballot this fall and if acting gov richard j codey is not taking some enjoyment in that , then he is an even better person than his web site would have you believe he is nine months ago , mr codey , a democrat , was the wouldbe governor who could not personally bankroll his candidacy mr corzine was the wouldbe governor who had spent 63 million to win his united states senate seat in 2000 , had promised to finance his own gubernatorial campaign and had given 8 million to other new jersey democrats along the way the county party chairmen decided that there would be no primary , and so there was none surely mr codey has not forgotten this and his friends and allies would not let him , in any event as he enjoys the 14month job he inherited as the senate president , governing with the benevolent air of a man who has found a warm and comfortable chair his honeymoon with the news media is now the longest in human history mr codey , instead of vacationing in the depths of august , was dispensing hope and good news he was promoting the fair and clean elections law , announcing improvements on the garden state parkway , creating housing for psychiatric patients and preserving farmland with the stroke of a pen meanwhile , mr corzine was in the news primarily for having given a mortgage of nearly a halfmillion dollars to a girlfriend , who is also the president of a union representing 9 , 000 state employees , and then forgiving the loan after they broke up mr forrester , his republican opponent , was alternately seeking refuge from reporters and protesting that he has not violated state election law by making political contributions the millions he gave his own campaign as well as the gifts to local party organizations while holding a majority stake in an insurance company to judge from the quinnipiac university polls , both candidates have some work to do even though mr corzine held a lead of 10 percentage points among likely voters , they are liking him less and less he was viewed favorably by 32 percent of registered voters in a survey taken aug 3 to 8 , a period during which his gift to the union president , carla katz , came to light his rating was 41 percent in january mr forrester s approval rating has managed to climb all the way to 25 percent at the same time , in a survey taken aug 14 to 16 by strategic vision , an atlanta company that polls in several states , just 44 percent of new jersey voters said they were satisfied with the gubernatorial candidates , while 46 percent said they were not \( the poll had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3 percentage points \) the percentage of voters satisfied with their choices in major political races usually falls in the high 50 s to mid60 s , said david e johnson , the chief executive of strategic vision when new jersey voters were surveyed during the presidential campaign last fall , mr johnson said , 57 percent said they were satisfied with the tickets mr johnson said that those numbers , in conjunction with mr codey s fairly high approval rating of 47 percent in the august poll , show that mr codey would be a stronger candidate than the ones who are running voters are asking , is either of these guys an improvement \? mr johnson said they have an acting governor they like they 'd rather keep what they have even some of mr codey s fans note that the heat of a campaign would have set his halo on fire fast but mr johnson said that candidates did not typically experience that kind of erosion of support , at least not those who are well known from the start so , in january , what is mr codey going to do with all his popularity points \? he will probably keep his job as the senate president , a post that his fellow democrats might have stripped him of if had he opposed mr corzine in a primary and lost he will post the bills he likes and smother the ones he does n't like as long as he is senate president , he will control the political action committee that dispenses millions of dollars to democratic senate candidates \( mr codey championed legislation that strictly limited contributions from government contractors to political campaigns , but it left out the legislative leadership political action committees \) that could be more fun than announcing improvements on the parkway and down the hall , in the governor s chair , will be a man who already has a few image problems photo laura mansnerus
if you have nothing better to do on a hot summer day , figure out the link among david cone , david wells , randy johnson , curt schilling , jon garland , keith foulke , mark mcgwire , nomar garciaparra , scott rolen , jason varitek , aaron boone , dave roberts and jason bay time s up they were all traded in the equivalent week between now and next sunday in the past decade yes , this is the week when division races , even the world series winner , could be determined it s also the week in which an unheralded minor leaguer will be traded , only to surface in several years as a major league star bay , for example , was traded by the mets to san diego three years ago next sunday as a class aa outfielder two weeks ago he was an allstar for the pittsburgh pirates some july trades have already been made this season barely into the month , the yankees acquired two pitchers , tim redding and darrell may , from san diego they have already started games for the yankees and been dispatched to the minors for their efforts the yankees also obtained al leiter last saturday , and he beat the red sox the next day next sunday , july 31 , is the deadline for teams to make trades without first securing waivers on the players the past two seasons produced memorable deals in 2003 the yankees acquired boone , and two and a half months later he hit a home run against boston that propelled the yankees into the world series but turnabout being fair play , the red sox obtained roberts on july 31 last year , and it was his stolen base two and a half months later that marked the beginning of the end of the yankees and the beginning of the greatest postseason comeback in baseball history roberts was one of three players the red sox added in a flurry of deals at the deadline , moves that became instrumental in boston s first world series championship in 86 years the other two , for shortstop orlando cabrera and first baseman doug mientkiewicz , solidified the infield defense , which had been a huge problem for the red sox nomar garciaparra , who had fallen out of favor in boston , went to the chicago cubs in a threeteam deal that also involved the montreal expos we had been talking to the cubs about a nomar deal , different variations of a nomar deal , theo epstein , the red sox general manager , recalled we never really got close on anything heading to the 30th we told the cubs we 'd be more inclined to do the deal if they could deliver not just cabrera but also mientkiewicz we felt we needed to improve our infield defense epstein said he and jim hendry , the cubs' general manager , also talked about the possibility of swapping pitchers , derek lowe for matt clement but we decided to keep lowe , feeling he would benefit from our improved infield defense , he said before any deal could be made , the cubs had to match up with the expos on a trade for cabrera and with the twins for a deal for mientkiewicz the biggest hurdle was to get omar to give up cabrera , epstein said , referring to omar minaya , who was the expos' general manager they did n't really have a fit to get everything done , epstein said , the red sox had to give the cubs a minor league outfielder , matt murton , so the cubs would give a minor league infielder , brendan harris , to the expos so they would put cabrera in the trade it went down to the last seconds , epstein said so did the boston deal with the dodgers for center fielder roberts we were very concerned about trot nixon s health , epstein said we had gabe kapler to play right , but we wanted a lefthand hitter to platoon we had a list of about 10 guys , some in the minors paul depodesta , the dodgers' general manager , called epstein and said he was making a deal for center fielder steve finley , freeing the dodgers to trade roberts he gave us a list of eight players , epstein said we made the deal five minutes before the deadline in the final 48 hours before the deadline last year , the mets made two deals for pitchers that created controversy among mets fans they gave up scott kazmir , a highly regarded pitching prospect , for victor zambrano , and they acquired kris benson for prospects in 1995 , cone and wells were traded three days apart in this equivalent week , cone to the yankees and wells to cincinnati wells eventually wound up with the yankees , and he and cone pitched perfect games 14 months apart oakland traded mcgwire to st louis on deadline day in 1997 , and the next year he broke roger maris s home run record , only to have his performance come under suspicion this year because of his refusal under oath to deny that he had used steroids on the same day as the mcgwire trade , the white sox and the giants engineered a nineplayer swap the giants hoped it would get them to the world series they did n't get there , but one of the players they gave up , foulke , is a reliever who helped the red sox win it last year on july 29 the next year , the white sox , who got foulke in the giants deal , obtained another pitcher in a seemingly minor deal with the cubs garland was a minor leaguer then , but today he leads the major leagues with 15 victories a limited market general managers do n't expect much trading activity this week they offer various reasons more teams than usual have a chance for the wildcard spots , so fewer teams are making players available teams are doing better economically and feel less need to dump salary teams are placing greater value on younger players , those in their first three years in the majors , because their relatively low salaries offset the higher pay earned by stars no impact players are available
new london , conn they have still not moved out not susette kelo not the derys not byron athenian or bill von winkle or the others five months after the united states supreme court set off a national debate by ruling that the city of new london could seize their property through eminent domain to make way for new private development , no one has been forced to leave no bulldozers have arrived to level the last houses still standing , and none are expected soon even though the holdouts lost their case , and the development that would displace them finally seems free to go forward , construction has not begun , and some elements of the project have been effectively paralyzed since the court ruling prompted a political outcry i felt relaxed enough to get my checkbook out and put the new roof on , said mr von winkle , who owns three buildings with a total of 12 occupied apartments in the fort trumbull neighborhood by the thames river , where the city was sued for claiming 15 properties through eminent domain ms kelo , also among the handful of holdouts , said , we still have hope that we 'll get to keep our homes it is not that ms kelo and the others have chained themselves to their property in a final dramatic defiance of the law instead , wary of public disapproval and challenges from groups like the institute for justice , the law firm that represented the holdouts in court , the state and the city have halted plans to evict the remaining residents investors are concerned about building on land that some people consider a symbol of property rights at the same time , contract disputes and financial uncertainty have delayed construction even in areas that have been cleared with so many complications , some people are unsure whether the city s initial vision for the property a mix of housing , hotel and office space intended to transform part of its riverfront and bolster a declining tax base is even realistic anymore winning took so long , said mayor jane l glover , that the plan may not be as viable in 2005 or 2006 or 2007 new london , founded in the 17th century as a port city in southeastern connecticut , has a high unemployment rate and fewer residents today than it had in 1920 its court battle over eminent domain started five years ago , when it claimed the property of six fort trumbull homeowners , a twoblock area within 90 acres set for development homeowners challenged the move , and the matter eventually made its way to the supreme court , which ruled 5 to 4 in june that the city had the right to take the land to improve its financial health , even though doing so would eventually transfer the property to a private developer but in a dissent that echoed what property rights activists were saying , justice sandra day o'connor wrote the specter of condemnation hangs over all property nothing is to prevent the state from replacing any motel 6 with a ritzcarlton , any home with a shopping mall or any farm with a factory congress and state legislatures across the country have reacted by revisiting eminent domain laws over the summer , the united states house of representatives passed a resolution condemning the court decision this month , the house voted overwhelmingly to deny federal economic development money for two years to local governments that seize private property for private development in september , gov m jodi rell of connecticut demanded that the new london development corporation , the city s development agency , rescind eviction orders delivered to tenants in rental units that belong to homeowners who have refused to give up their property the connecticut general assembly has asked cities to delay using eminent domain while it considers revising state law some city and state officials cite the difficulty in finding a balance between using eminent domain to rebuild blighted areas and preventing the potential for abuse that concerned justice o'connor we 're not writing a law to solve the new london problem , said state representative michael p lawlor , a democrat who is cochairman of the judiciary committee we 're writing a law to fix the sandra day o'connor problem amid all the debate , the fort trumbull project has stalled this lawsuit put a chill on the development of the whole 90 acres , no doubt in my mind , said thomas j londregan , the city s director of law any developer knew that whatever they did would most likely be appealed to the courts contentiousness led to stalemate and stumbles at one point the city severed ties with the new london development corporation , only to reverse itself days later under pressure from the state a key corporation executive was forced out pressure to go forward is considerable , even if momentum is not the state has already invested 73 million on environmental cleanup and sewer and road improvements elegant street lamps , intended to illuminate a gentrified new riverfront , instead shine over empty lots where buildings have been leveled but not replaced in recent weeks the city , the state and the developer , bostonbased corcoran jennison , have begun discussing ways to jumpstart construction in empty areas details are not firm we are currently working our way toward what i believe will be something fruitful , said michael joplin , president of the new london development corporation one point of contention corcoran jennison is resisting pressure from the city to build a waterfront hotel first , as was initially planned , out of concern that there is no market for one corcoran jennison says that pfizer , which built a major research center next to the site in the late 1990 s and pushed for the fort trumbull development , backed away from a commitment to help pay for the hotel as the lawsuit dragged on and the prospects for a coast guard museum , which under one plan could be built on the holdouts' land , are also unclear still , ron angelo , deputy commissioner of the state s department of economic and community development , insists that the project , at least in some form , will get under way soon i think for the first time in a number of months , if not years , we have come close to beginning with the project , he said if any construction begins soon , it will happen away from the area where the holdouts remain , said marty jones , president of corcoran jennison , which has been under contract on the project since 1999 we need to have some positive things happening so that every lender and investor i go to does n't say , 'i want to be 100 miles away from here , ' ms jones said eminent domain in fort trumbull has been on the front page of every newspaper in the country , and it has not put new london in the most positive light despite losing in court , the holdouts have gained political leverage , largely through the public relations effort led by the institute for justice , mr joplin said scott g bullock , a lawyer for the institute for justice who argued for the resistant property owners before the supreme court , said , we might have lost the battle , but the overall war is really going in our favor what developer is going to want to build on land that was received through probably the most universally despised supreme court decision in decades \? mr bullock asked governor rell has hired a mediator to meet with the holdouts the goal is to see what , if any , financial terms , beyond the outdated appraised value they have been offered , might persuade them to leave i'm on the road to search for the proverbial winwin , said the mediator , robert r albright it s an extraordinarily complex situation it s not a twoparty situation by any means i'm not sure i can honestly give you an option set or even fully describe the obstacles the property owners have their critics in new london they have been accused of delaying the city s resurgence , and even of taking payoffs from property rights advocates in order to keep up the fight but at least a few , after seeing most of their neighborhood leveled , say they will consider coming to terms with mr albright if the money is right others , however , have not ruled out new lawsuits meanwhile , some renters are moving in , not out michelle cerrato arrived from pennsylvania in september and found her twobedroom apartment on walbach street through a newspaper ad unaware of the fuss over eminent domain , ms cerrato , a 30yearold casino hostess with three children , soon figured out why neighbors have signs in their windows that say , not for sale confused and concerned that she would be evicted , she called her landlord , sue dery , one of the holdouts she said it s not going to happen , ms cerrato said it s been going on for eight years

to the editor the aug 21 frontpage article in the debate over darwin series says , as much philosophical worldview as scientific hypothesis , intelligent design challenges darwin s theory of natural selection by arguing that some organisms are too complex to be explained by evolution alone , pointing to the possibility of supernatural influences intelligent design is not a scientific hypothesis it is not testable it is reasoning from incredulity none of the scholars promoting intelligent design have produced a scintilla of evidence to back up their claims it is only the woeful lack of scientific literacy in this country that gives this false controversy any legs at all judith buhrman seminole fla , aug 21 , 2005
margaret court followed the money down a desolate twolane highway about 40 miles northeast of san diego , the road known as wildcat canyon slithered past orange groves , a dusty indian reservation and through the shadows of the cuyamaca mountains it was an uncomfortable stretch , so isolated that mexican drug smugglers favored the route for their midnight drops reaching the outpost of ramona , calif , margaret found a luxury housing development still in the bulldozing stage it was may 13 , 1973 a tennis hasbeen named bobby riggs and a sure 10 , 000 were just 48 hours away mother s day all the 5foot10 aussie had to do was punch a few volleys past the geezer in telescopic glasses all the mommy of the moment had to decide was where to ace the mouthy , wrinkled runt down the middle or out wide it was going to be so easy with her husband and infant son by her side , margaret would walk onto a court surrounded by 3 , 200 fans in makeshift bleachers , impose her v8 power strokes on bobby , and exit this lizard s paradise with the winnertakeall payday , plus an extra 10 , 000 in television rights fees from cbs margaret often described money as an evil , but even she had to admit that the dough was the inducement that brought her here , not bobby s sexist prattle she entered her match with riggs as if it were an exhibition , rather than a serious competition against a skilled and cunning opponent and she gave no thought to its social consequences american women were tossing bras , girdles and nylons into trash bins , but the women s movement did n't move margaret she was a mrs , not a ms i found that a difficult time , margaret recalls i always felt your gift made room for you whether you 're a man or whether you 're a woman , i did n't feel you had to go over the top no , margaret was never one to go over the top she was a benevolent bystander when billie jean king and eight other women risked their tennis careers in daring skirmishes for prizemoney equality in 1970 she was a practicing pacifist when those women known as the original nine defied the male tennis establishment to form an autonomous circuit called the virginia slims margaret just was n't the defiant type she preferred to be a noncombatant amid the gender mudslinging of the early seventies as a devout christian who found moral clarity in the scriptures , she was like many alienated onlookers who could n't separate manbashing militants from the messengers of equality everything had changed so much , so fast while she was away she had fled from fame in 1966 , retiring from tennis for two years , desperate to shed her label as the aussie wonder girl who had won 13 majors before her 25th birthday but after her marriage to barry court in 1967 , she returned to the tour in 1968 she had n't touched a racket in two years , but she slipped right back into her old competitive skin in 1970 , margaret won all four majors to capture the elusive grand slam none of those victories was more remarkable than her twoandahalfhour epic at wimbledon just before her final against billie jean king , margaret received two painkiller injections into her puffy ankle , blue from a ligament she tore in an earlier match billie jean grimaced through the end of the match with leg cramps and cranky knees barry traveled the world with margaret he shrugged off the teases from the blokes back home and never seemed threatened by her success she was embraced , not marginalized by men she did n't realize that few women of her time could join her in saying , i was always the leader of the gang , you know , i had eight boys in the street and i was the cowboy and never the indian i never felt frustrated all of her life , gentlemen had routinely opened doors for margaret from wal rutter , the grumpy pro at the tennis club in her hometown of albury , new south wales , to the gym attendants who let her into the weight room at 5 am , to her coach , the australian tennis legend frank sedgman , who whisked her away from albury , offering her a job as a typist and a future as a player at fifteen , margaret smith , who grew up in a rented home where she could measure the financial burdens on her family in the amount of alcohol her father drank , was bound for melbourne to become a gender bender of her own design a woman with uncommon muscle but traditional values throughout her career , margaret was an opponent s nightmare she swooped down and plucked more titles than any woman in history as the unassuming wife who was happy to take career breaks for childbirth after the first of her three children arrived in 1972 , margaret sat on the sideline for nearly a year she returned to the tennis mix in 1973 , starting off the season with an australian open title family , tennis and god margaret s priorities were family , tennis and , especially , god , after a spiritual rebirth in the spring of 1972 religion simplified her world it eliminated political nuance and its complexities , perhaps one reason she never saw the social tentacles attached to the mouth of bobby riggs to her , bobby was a harmless huckster with an outdated game and a chauvinist s shtick , a threat to be taken as seriously as a haunted house his fangs were false his hair was dyed his best days were cobwebbed she did n't get it , billie says she just did n't get it bobby reveled in the perception of himself as a living , breathing punch line of the senior circuit , but there was a message in his act in the early seventies , bobby began speaking out against the short shrifting of seniors he demanded more prize money for aging exchampions like himself while mocking billie jean king s own crusade for equal pay if women are raking it in , what about us \? bobby felt sure that any graying champ could knock the high heels off any woman anywhere and it would mean a second lap with fame for riggs himself the spritesized riggs , a player who survived against giants by exploiting their human weaknesses , plotted his way to the wimbledon men s singles title in 1939 at 21 the instant attention he gained was delightfully dizzying , a feeling he never thought he 'd recapture then came the spring of '73 to be surrounded like a bonfire again , to be seated at the best tables in the house , it all made for an intoxicating range of possibilities but he could n't realize any of them unless he made the match a reality so bobby did what came naturally for him he put money on it armed with a 5 , 000 carrot , he sent out telegrams challenging his wish list of opponents billie jean king , chris evert and margaret smith court billie was the one he wanted , the one who really mattered the sex leader of the revolutionary pack , he tagged her that was typical riggs , a lob over the net that was meant to tease , to frustrate to goad billie just let it skip out of bounds there was nothing in it for women s tennis , billie says i kept saying , 'no , bobby , no ' undervalued in king s eyes margaret could n't resist the bait at first , hardly anyone knew that she had accepted bobby s invitation then she and billie shared a ride in an elevator at the virginia slims in detroit i'm going to play bobby riggs , margaret mentioned as they inched down the shaft what \? i'm getting 10 , 000 that s not enough , billie countered , and , secondly , this is not about tennis what do you mean \? i'm about to get 10 , 000 margaret , i'm just going to ask one thing of you you have to win this match margaret nodded politely too politely no , i mean it you have to win this match you have no idea how important this is billie understood what margaret could n't grasp with critics starting to assail title ix , with companies still treating working women as credit liabilities and maternity risks , with the credibility of feminists on the line , the consequences of a loss to bobby could be dire however , as billie would later point out , margaret did n't see the big picture a large , malleable national television audience was expected to watch margaret s match against bobby billie knew this was no time for a woman to fall apart the problem was , several earlyround losses in the late sixties had earned margaret a reputation for emotional fragility whether it was justified or not , nearly every player on the tour thought of margaret as someone who collapsed under pressure a choker our reputation is at stake , and i'm afraid bobby will win , billie told the press days before the match here is an old jerk who dyes his hair , waddles like a duck and has trouble seeing we have nothing to gain seeing beneath the bravado billie was familiar with the puckish , if not outright devilish , interior hidden behind bobby s hamhanded persona born 26 years after riggs , reared just a few miles from his public park haunts in los angeles , billie had heard the folk tales of his crafty tactics and unquenchable taste for action she knew he was a great competitor , an esteemed former wimbledon champion , and an ace poolhall hustler disguised in tennis whites i just thought , here is a man who has quite a big mouth , margaret recalls you almost could n't blame margaret she 'd never been manipulated by a man but then she 'd never met a man quite like bobby riggs he was n't in tune with women and politics but , one day , he opened his chops and out came a line that prompted a few giggles , and whetted his appetite for attention c'mon , billie let s play for some money although the press took up his challenge , the players largely ignored bobby until margaret court said , yes privately , she was annoyed that billie had been bobby s target when it was margaret who had the best record on the tour i 've beaten better men than bobby in practice matches , court announced to reporters hardly the taunting type , she played the good sport and went along with bobby s schemes to hype the event the media lapped up the loudmouth call it the match of the century , bobby spouted at a news conference in march to announce his match with margaret on mother s day it was hyperbole with a purpose bobby was already applying pressure on margaret s suspect nerves this was bobby s moment , and he did n't want to squander it by taking margaret lightly he worked out relentlessly bobby ran at least a mile a day around a school track near his newport beach digs bobby s son larry , the only one of his children who had excelled as a tennis player , teamed with bobby s best friend , lornie kuhle , to oversee his father s diligent preparation for the match with margaret for three or four months , we 're talking running every day , playing six hours of tennis a day , larry says train , train , train he was playing the best tennis of his life training by itself , though , could n't push back the clock fast or far enough to suit bobby he needed a youth potion to match up with the 30yearold margaret at 55 , he sought out rheo blair , hollywood s top nutritional guru under blair s supervision , bobby adopted a diet of protein , dairy products and 415 vitamins a day no booze , no broads , vows bobby , the headlines read bobby s base of operation was the park newport condo complex , where he was the tennis director of a swinging singles california enclave for the geritol set to promote his match with margaret , bobby all but ran an open house for the news media , working the room day and night his favorite tshirt bore the acronym worms the world organization for the retention of male supremacy he was always full of philosophical prose , which he doled out to media by the ladle margaret is an evenmoney bet she plays like a man , i play like a woman women who can do those who ca n't become feminists bobby s colorful comments had reach from tennis diehards to the man on the street , they all pounced on every outrageous sentence the flimflam man uttered in the 1970 s , tennis sizzled and bobby was its latest walking , ever talking marquee attraction now all he had to do was win bobby scouted margaret , taking copious notes while following her around the virginia slims circuit then he candidly laid out his plan for beating her serve her the soft stuff , throw off her power with spins , upset her rhythm with drop shots , wear down her patience with lobs from lubbock to las vegas , the more bobby chattered , the more folks he convinced jimmy the greek , the oddsmaker of the moment , made riggs the 52 favorite but the more bobby talked up his tactics , the more margaret laughed off his jibes and quips as she continued to win on the tour i am not carrying the banner for women s lib , she declared indifference and shock her indifference to the hype befuddled bobby why was n't margaret reacting \? was n't she worried \? then margaret took off the week before the match to practice with her parttime coach dennis van der meer special workouts with van der meer hmmm she was feeling the pinch , bobby thought perfect two days before the match , margaret , barry , and their 14monthold son , danny , made the journey through the gaunt wilderness to san diego country estates with all the shouting and all the showbiz , margaret says , i guess i was shocked she had barely fought through the swarm of photographers when bobby began trying his best to crack her cool do you realize , margaret , bobby chimed above the fray , that this is the most important match ever played \? just think how many women are counting on you get off it , luv margaret appeared unruffled by whatever bobby cooked up she treated her opponent cordially , for the most part , and even seemed to find him amusing she got into the spirit of the event by sticking a popular button on danny s bib women s libbers speak for themselves bobby riggs bleah ! the night before the match , everyone convened in the dining area for one last supper , as bobby called it the eyes and ears of the world are on me , riggs howled i am the greatest money player in history the court family dined quietly , alone on the other side of the room , removed from the carnival barker in their midst during dinner , danny turned his high chair into a snare drum , banging his spoon to his own beat the rap was so loud , so unrestrained , and so obnoxious , margaret could n't help but note , you make more noise than bobby riggs there it was bobby was inside margaret s head just where he wanted to be a dance for the roses mother s day morning started off inauspiciously in margaret s suite danny had dumped his mom s only pair of tennis shoes into the toilet it was the beginning of an interesting time , margaret says at least her prized dress was dry at her request , dress designer extraordinaire ted tinling had whipped up a pastel dress trimmed in the aussie national colors of green and gold margaret s name was embroidered on each side of her collar here she was , a woman who usually sought invisibility , and she was all but wearing a vanity plate margaret loped to the net to greet the 57 bobby before the match , towering over him as if they were dates at an eighthgrade dance instead of a corsage , bobby handed her a dozen roses as they met in front of cbs commentator pat summerall for the nicest mother in tennis , bobby grinned happy mother s day nasty little man , she thought but to the world , margaret did not seem the least bit offended she curtsied in front of the cameras , almost blushing submissively all week , tales of how she had dismantled tony trabert s power in practice had circled the grounds but that , bobby believed , was the wrong preparation she should have been practicing against a beginner his strategy worked right from the start bobby immediately rendered the circuit s most dominating female force into a weekend hacker by dinking his serves , punching drop shots and lobbing the ball into the afternoon sun flummoxed in the face of bobby s underwhelming attack , her confidence evaporated as the pressure on her built she tumbled into bobby s trap he had made a career out of waiting for an opponent s mistake connecting on just 18 of 37 first serves , court s collapse happened at flashbulb speed meanwhile , billie jean king had nearly missed the match entirely after stepping off a plane on a layover in hawaii between tokyo and la , billie , her secretary marilyn barnett , and fellow tennis star rosie casals raced through the terminal , frantically looking for one of those coinoperated tv sets attached to the chairs in the waiting areas at last they found a vacant one nothing but gunsmoke reruns finally , they heard the result on rosie s radio in just 57 minutes bobby had dismantled margaret , 62 , 61 something to prove' billie was beside herself she knew margaret s loss would not only be used to undermine the fight for equal pay on the tour , it would also provide an easy caricature for political cartoonists she marched through the terminal , incensed and motivated that s it , she thought i 've got to play him billie phoned her husband and said , larry , now we 've got something to prove on tv , the nation saw bobby hop the net in california to embrace margaret after a match that tennis devot es still remember as the mother s day massacre bobby s instinct for timing kicked in instantly in front of the postmatch press , he voiced his favorite male fantasy now i want king bad i 'll play her on clay , grass , wood , cement , marble or roller skates , he declared we got to keep this sex thing going i'm a woman specialist now during interviews bobby flapped his lips again and again to issue yet another challenge to billie i want her , she s the women s libber leader far too late , margaret recognized the magnitude of her match with bobby it was one of my mistakes , margaret wistfully says now this had n't been a tennis event , but a human saga between the sidelines this had n't been a casual sunday hit , but a political proving ground for gender billie would have margaret s political ignorance to thank for spinning her destiny into motion in essence , margaret was a matchmaker bobby had been waiting for a gal like billie all of his life this article is an adaptation from a necessary spectacle billie jean king , bobby riggs , and the tennis match that leveled the game , \( crown \) by selena roberts about the 1973 battle of the sexes , which was more about gender , politics , theater and equal pay than tennis it is often forgotten that without riggs s humiliation of the mighty margaret court , kingriggs would have never happened
naples , fla , oct 24 hurricane wilma charged across south florida in a few turbulent hours monday morning , thrashing neighborhoods on both of the state s coasts , shattering highrise windows , pushing seawater over much of the florida keys and knocking out power to an estimated 34 million homes and businesses the storm entered the state shortly after dawn near marco island on the southwest gulf coast as a category 3 hurricane packing winds of up to 125 miles per hour soon , it was traveling at the rapid clip of 25 mph it carved a wide path northeast , roiling the miami and fort lauderdale region and finally , seven hours later , roaring into the atlantic ocean near west palm beach , still a category 2 storm with winds of 105 mph most of the populated areas on the gulf coast were on the northern side of the storm , where conditions were less brutal but they still saw widespread flooding , crumpled mobile homes , airborne roofs and countless downed trees early damage estimates were at least 2 billion fort lauderdale and several other cities ordered residents to boil their tap water in miami , the winds shattered skyscraper windows , leaving a coating of glass shards along brickell avenue downtown at least seven people were reported killed in the state one man was killed in coral springs , near fort lauderdale , when a tree fell on him in palm beach county , the police said two people were killed but they declined to say how the associated press said one man died when an accident involving debris hurled him through his windshield as he approached his car a woman from st johns county died in a car crash while evacuating , and a woman from boynton beach was killed when a glass door fell on her in collier county , a man was killed when his roof fell in , and another died of a heart attack while trying to walk through the storm one woman , two months pregnant , miscarried after seeking refuge in a red cross shelter earlier , the storm left at least six people dead in mexico and 13 in jamaica and haiti as residents of florida emerged to assess the damage , gov jeb bush said the state , which had days to prepare as the storm stalled over the yucat n peninsula of mexico , had everything it needed to start recovering we 've got a response team that is second to none , governor bush said in a tallahassee news conference we will get through this storm and respond quickly r david paulison , acting director of the federal emergency management agency , said that since president bush had declared the hurricane a major disaster , the agency would immediately begin distributing grants for temporary housing , home repairs and other stormrelated expenses search and rescue teams had already been sent to collier county in far southwestern florida , where hurricane wilma entered the state , and would soon move into neighboring lee county , mr paulison said power was being restored in collier county on monday evening yes , we 're tired of hurricanes , mr paulison said but we are prepared at the height of the hurricane , the state s eighth in 15 months , an estimated 33 , 000 people had sought refuge in more than 120 shelters throughout the state , officials said governor bush said that 3 , 100 national guard members had been deployed in the affected areas and that another 3 , 500 were standing by he also said 4 , 000 florida utility workers were ready to start restoring electricity , as were 6 , 500 from other states hurricane wilma also caused heavy flooding in cuba as it made its way across the gulf of mexico toward florida several lowlying neighborhoods had to be evacuated in havana , where waves poured over the malecon , the historic waterfront promenade , and inundated streets the storm s rapid pace across florida meant that there was less rainfall , with only 8 inches falling on miami and 65 inches in naples , a fraction of what soaked yucat n in key west , at the far southern end of the chain of islands connected to the mainland by narrow causeways , officials said as many as 90 percent of the residents had ignored evacuation orders it made for a tense morning , as the sea rushed into many sections of the island , pouring into homes and submerging vehicles in everglades city , a village of about 700 fishermen and touristboat operators in far southwestern florida , a storm surge flooded streets and yards with up to four feet of water but because most houses were built on stilts or mounds of earth , the damage was limited mayor sammy hamilton jr said that the cost of the damage would run into the millions but that the city would probably recovery quickly our city , in a month s time , will look like new , mr hamilton said but it s going to be a lot of hard work and a lot of money

flatbottom skiff had been tossed up on the dock nearby long stretches of a dock running along the barron river were torn up , and a few power poles were knocked askew , wires dangling from them many people evacuated from everglades city before the hurricane but some who remained said the storm was the worst since hurricane donna in 1960 it was as bad as i want to go through , said bob wells , who owns a local real estate agency it was unnerving , mr wells said , being stuck in your house with the wind howling fiercely , trees going down and you knowing the water is rising in naples , 55 miles north of everglades city , the storm did not do a great deal of damage to buildings , although uprooted trees were in a jumble throughout the city , and repair costs were expected to run into the tens of millions of dollars a few blocks away , kathleen cantera said she was preparing to evacuate her children and her jewelry to orlando , where she hoped they would find electricity her goldcolored stucco house with wroughtiron gates was dry for now , but the street out front was becoming more flooded it was the worst i 've ever been through , ms cantera said on marco island , south of naples , officials estimated that 30 percent of the homes had roof damage in fort myers beach , farther north on the gulf coast , mayor bill van duzer said he was mostly pleased with the way his area had weathered the hurricane there s a certain amount of damage , he said , but the sewers are operational , the water s operational , the roads are clear mr paulison of fema said many mobile homes were destroyed in rural glades county , which borders lake okeechobee , in the middle of south florida carl fowler , a spokesman for the broward county emergency operations center , said the damage there , on the atlantic coast , was the worst from a hurricane since the 1950 s mobile homes were particularly hard hit , and two tall buildings housing the county courthouse and school board saw many of

baseball s hall of fame voters , whose 2005 selections will be announced tuesday , struggle with where to place relievers among the game s historical elite that s because saves , the only relief statistic with any gravitas , have become far less weighty in the past 20 years comparing yesteryear s firemen to those of today is akin to comparing golfers on the earth and on the moon the only reasonably modern closers deemed worthy of the hall have been rollie fingers , whose 1970 s appearances routinely lasted at least two innings , and dennis eckersley , who in the late 1980 s began the modern practice of rarely pitching more than one elite closers caught between this evolution , like bruce sutter and rich gossage , have career statistics that dismissive voters strain to parse we know that the relief appearances of sutter \( who received 60 percent of the vote last year , well short of the required 75 percent \) and gossage \( 41 percent \) were more trying compared with those of the eckersleyesque closers of today , but to what degree \? and how easy were those of lee smith , whose mammoth record of 478 saves still leaves him a long shot for induction \? thanks to retrosheet , the volunteerrun organization that archives historical playbyplay data , these questions can begin to be answered perhaps not in time to change this year s voting , but in time to fuel the imminent arguments as it turns out , arguments for sutter , gossage and some forgotten relievers could have more fuel than ever there s a huge difference between the sutters and gossages and the closers people think of today , like eric gagne , said retrosheet s founder , dave smith , by day a biology professor at the university of delaware this is directly accessible by playbyplay data recognizing that not all saves are created equal starting the ninth with the bases empty is nothing like entering a jam in the seventh retrosheet unearths how hard each reliever s save opportunity was , looking at the length of the appearance and the inherited runners on base first , the length issue eckersley s saves lasted an average of 333 outs , a drastic break from closers before him outings for gossage \( 472 \) , sutter \( 473 \) and fingers \( 482 \) lasted more than 40 percent longer , with little difference among those three \( eckersley s save chances came with none out in the ninth 63 percent of the time , compared with 31 percent to 35 percent for the other three pitchers for a guy who gave out so few free passes , eckersley did get many himself \) second , regardless of inning , how threatening a situation did these relievers enter \? this can be quantified by assessing the outs and base runners when they took the mound the calculations will be skipped here , but once again , the numbers show how eckersley , who entered many innings with no one on base , had a much easier time his situations generally posed an average threat of 57 runs sutter \( 64 \) , fingers \( 66 \) and gossage \( 68 \) were thrown into hotter fires these numbers do not just put a numerical face on how closers who preceded eckersley pitched vastly longer and under tougher initial conditions to be fair , eckersley was inducted partly because he won 149 games as a starter before switching to relief in 1987 the numbers also show that sutter and gossage are quite comparable to fingers , who was heartily inducted in 1992 , and that smith s 478 saves were clearly more of the modern variety looking at these statistics further highlights how valuable sutter s and gossage s contemporaries , and predecessors , truly were for example , dan quisenberry , the fantastic royals submariner through the 1980 s , lasted 519 outs a save , more than sutter , gossage and even fingers , making his relatively light 244 career saves \( and 75 percent success rate \) much more impressive unfortunately , quisenberry was banished from the ballot in 1996 because he received so little initial support his only hope is to be elected by the veterans committee , whose selections are announced every other march it s through this process that sparky lyle , one of the most forgotten firemen , is found to deserve more consideration than he will surely receive lyle dominated lineups through the 1970 s for the red sox and the yankees , entering tight situations no matter how early in the game in game 4 of the 1977 american league championship series against kansas city , he came on in the fourth inning and pitched twohit shutout ball the rest of the way it turns out that lyle not only took an average of 466 outs \( in sutter and gossage territory \) for his saves , but he also entered games in vastly tighter situations than any reliever thus far discussed he came on with an average of 108 runners more than twice as many as eckersley , for example , and 25 percent more than the elite relievers of his time look at eckersley and lyle , retrosheet s smith said it s like they 're not playing the same position as for sharing the same position in cooperstown s hall of fame gallery , that will probably have to wait for most of these relievers their plaques will never be cast with retrosheet s numbers , but votes for them probably should be keeping score email keepingscore nytimescom
washington , june 13 the disclosure of british government memorandums portraying the bush administration as bent on war with iraq by the summer of 2002 , and insufficiently prepared for postinvasion problems , has caused a political stir on both sides of the atlantic , in part because opponents of president bush and prime minister tony blair see the documents as proof that both men misled their countries into war but the documents are not quite so shocking three years ago , the nearunanimous conventional wisdom in washington held that mr bush was determined to topple saddam hussein by any means necessary plenty of people chief among them colin l powell , then secretary of state were also warning in public and private that the pentagon was ill prepared for prolonged occupation what no one knew then for certain \( though some lonely voices did predict it \) is that american forces would find none of the lethal chemical or biological weapons that mr bush and mr blair said made iraq so dangerous , or that the antiamerican insurgency would be so durable and deadly that is why the british memos' foresight read with the benefit of hindsight rings so bittersweet for those who tried in vain to avert the war , and remain aghast at its human and material costs representative john conyers jr of michigan , the ranking democrat on the house judiciary committee , plans to hold an informational forum about the memos \( without republican participation \) on thursday blogs are awash in discussions of the memos , and full of criticism of the mainstream american media for not paying them more mind in an interview on monday , mr conyers said that it is n't that there was n't any discussion of the issues in the memos three years ago , but it was all being put down , almost uniformly by administration officials now , he added , unless the british intelligence service ca n't take accurate notes of a meeting , it was very well understood that this was exactly what was going to happen the memos do shed new light on the thinking of senior british officials , and their view of american thinking , in the months before the invasion at a minimum , they suggest that the bush administration paid no less \( and no more \) heed to the concerns of its closest ally than it did to those of its own secretary of state but the memos are not the dead sea scrolls there has been ample evidence for many months , and even years , that top bush administration figures saw war as inevitable by the summer of 2002 in the march 31 , 2003 , issue of the new yorker , with the invasion just under way , richard n haass , then the state department s director of policy planning , said that in early july 2002 he asked condoleezza rice , then national security adviser , whether it made sense to put iraq at the center of the agenda , with a global campaign against terrorism already under way and she said , essentially , that that decision s been made , do n't waste your breath , he said then by july 2002 , daily newspapers were filled with details of war plans , which had been seeping out since late spring , and internal administration disputes over whether the planning was adequate in august , vice president dick cheney made a bellicose speech to the veterans of foreign wars , in which he warned that a return of united nations weapons inspectors to iraq would provide no assurance whatsoever of mr hussein s compliance the socalled downing street memo , a summary of a prime minister s meeting on july 23 , 2002 , does not put forward specific proof that mr bush had taken any particular action , only a general sense that it seemed clear that bush had made up his mind to take military action , even if the timing was not yet decided it describes the impression of britain s chief of the secret intelligence service , that the intelligence and facts were being fixed around the policy , but does not elaborate rather , what the memo seems to emphasize is that the united states could build greater support for any military action especially from britain by first confronting iraq through the united nations , the course it eventually took at the urging of mr blair and mr powell the latest memo published , first in the washington post and the times of london over the weekend , is from july 21 , 2002 it warned that a postwar occupation of iraq could lead to a protracted and costly nationbuilding exercise , in which washington could look to us to share a disproportionate share of the burden for better or worse , the questions raised anew by the memos are not likely to go away last summer , the senate intelligence committee issued a scathing , unanimous report that most of the major key judgments in the october 2002 national intelligence estimate on iraq s illicit weapons were either overstated , or were not supported by , the underlying intelligence reporting by prior agreement , the committee focused only on the role played by intelligence agencies , and reserved the question of how policy makers used intelligence for a future study , which is bogged down in internal disputes and competing priorities but senator john d rockefeller iv of west virginia , the committee s ranking democrat , said monday in a statement , the committee has an obligation to answer these questions , and the american people deserve answers only then can we provide a full and complete accounting of the mistakes leading up to the war in iraq and what changes are necessary to fix them
camden , nj , july 18 the three boys who suffocated in the trunk of a car last month were alive for at least 17 hours and maybe up to 33 hours after they became trapped , a lawyer who represents one of the families involved said on monday the lawyer , peter m villari , said he spoke with officials from the camden county prosecutor s office who told him that further autopsy reports had indicated that the children , who were found dead in a car trunk in the yard where they were last seen , were alive well into the search for them the time of death has become a significant issue in the aftermath of the troubling deaths because none of the 150 police officers assigned to the search checked the trunk of a brokendown toyota parked steps away from where the children were last seen when one boy s father opened the trunk two days after they had disappeared , he discovered the three curledup bodies inside the authorities said the first autopsy reports did not indicate when the children had died many people in camden were outraged that the police did not find the children sooner and were pressing the authorities to determine if the children could have been saved had the police looked into the trunk early on the police have said they looked inside the car and underneath it , but never opened the trunk the camden authorities opened an internal investigation to determine what went wrong that report is due next week several community groups have also vowed to open their own independent investigations to get to the bottom of the oversight the new autopsy information , mr villari said , puts the blame squarely on the shoulders of the police because it means that the children could have been found alive i think the numbers speak for themselves , he said they were certainly alive when the police arrived and certainly well after the search started mr villari also said officials in the prosecutor s office apologized to the parents and promised this would never happen again in camden bill shralow , a spokesman for the camden county prosecutor s office , said that the official report was likely to be released soon and that he would not discuss it beforehandlt mike lynch , a spokesman for the camden police department , said he was asked by the prosecutor s office not to comment mr villari represents the family of anibal cruz jr , an 11yearold who had a severe learning disability and was known as a sweet but hyperactive child it was at his house in the cramer hill neighborhood of camden that anibal and two friends , daniel agosto , 6 , and jesstin pagan , 5 , were last seen alive around 5 30 pm on june 22 when relatives were watching them play in the yard two of the boys' mothers said they went inside for half an hour to cook dinner and when they returned the three boys had disappeared the families searched for three hours before calling the police many residents in camden have also blamed them for not calling the police sooner and for not checking the trunk of the car , where one of the boys \( the police have yet to say which one \) was known to have enjoyed playing the boys were found dead around 6 30 pm on june 24 investigators concluded that boys died accidentally after they climbed into the trunk while playing and became trapped when the lid slammed shut originally , the police thought the children might have drowned in the nearby delaware river , and they devoted extensive resources to scour the waterfront mr villari who has said that he was looking into negligence lawsuits against the camden authorities and possibly toyota said the information indicated that at a minimum , the boys were alive until 10 30 am on june 23 at a maximum until 2 30 am on june 24 he said the autopsy reports that were shared with the families were based on examinations of fluid and tissue samples and weatherrelated data mr villari said that anibal s mother , elba nelly cruz , did not say much when told about the findings she was numb , he said some outside medical examiners had speculated that the boys would not have survived long in the car trunk because in their panic they would have sucked down the little air and quickly replaced it with noxious carbon dioxide gas from their hurried exhaling but cyril h wecht , the coroner of allegheny county , pa , and past president of the american academy of forensic sciences , said weeks ago that the boys could have lived 12 hours or maybe longer because the trunk of an older car is hardly airtight the car the boys were trapped in was a 1992 toyota camry that had not moved in weeks when told of the new information on monday , dr wecht said it seemed to point to negligence there is no reason why that trunk should not have been checked , he said this is what kids do they crawl into things refrigerators , grandma s trunk in the attic , car trunks it s a very obvious place to look one mystery , though , is if the three boys were alive that long , why nobody heard them struggling to get out of the trunk the police and family members have been unable to answer that question or why numerous tracking dogs used in the search failed to pick up on a scent in the yard and follow it to the trunk dr wecht said the boys probably slipped into unconsciousness a few hours after they got trapped and eventually went into comas they probably would have suffered some brain damage had they

a new kind of designer index fund has arrived on the scene instead of trying merely to match the performance of the stock market , as measured by some broad index like the standard poor s 500 , these new funds are aiming to outperform it the s p 500 , the most widely used benchmark , compounded by 95 percent a year , on average , over the 10 years ended sept 30 statistics show that about twothirds of actively managed equity mutual funds failed to outperform the market over 3 , 5 and 10year periods , let alone longer spans that has been the impetus for index funds that aspire merely to match the market s return backers of the new variety of index funds say that the products can beat the market and other index funds , either because they have found ways to exploit stock market inefficiencies or because the indexes , especially those based on market capitalization , like the s p 500 , are themselves flawed none of the handful of funds that fall into this category have been around long enough to register persuasive longterm results nevertheless , the best performers have managed to more than just outpace benchmarks in fact , they have clobbered them , behaving a bit like index funds on steroids powershares capital management , a small but fastgrowing issuer of exchangetraded funds , the increasingly popular alternative to traditional mutual funds , has been the main innovator in this arena based in wheaton , ill , it has started a series of index funds that it calls xtf s and whose goal is to beat benchmark indexes like other etf s , they trade on exchanges the way stocks do but they are different in their composition they mirror custombuilt indexes based on socalled intellidexes , created by a quantitative unit of the american stock exchange in these formulations , stocks in an existing index are sifted and ranked for potential capital appreciation each stock is scored by using 25 variables such as cash flow , earnings growth , shareprice momentum and timeliness the 100 topranked stocks make up the custom index , with the added requirement that sector weightings parallel the broader index if , say , 20 percent of an index is composed of financials , so is the intellidex for that index powershares offered the first two of these funds at the beginning of may 2003 from their start , both have run well ahead of their index bogeys its flagship core fund , dynamic market portfolio , is up 70 percent since it started , compared with a 39 percent gain for the s p 500 over the same period its dynamic otc fund , has climbed 75 percent , while the nasdaq 100 index is up 53 percent in a variation on the theme , pimco , the money management giant based in newport beach , calif , started two hybrid equity mutual funds at the end of may the funds , called fundamental index plus and fundamental index plus total return , are based on a proprietary index of largecapitalization companies that also seeks to outgun the s p 500 the funds are run by pimco s star portfolio manager , william h gross , who is better known for his bondfund expertise both contain a small bond component but are mainly built around the research affiliates fundamental index , developed by robert d arnott , who serves as a subadviser the index uses sales , cash flow and other fundamental factors to come up with the 1 , 000 largest american companies measured by the size of their footprint in the economy , not on their share price , said mr arnott , the chairman of research affiliates , based in pasadena , calif , and editor of the financial analysts journal the index is intended to serve as a counterpoise to the s p 500 , which is weighted by market capitalization , or the stock market value of a company s outstanding shares while the s p 500 dropped by a cumulative 11 percent from 2000 to 2004 , the rafi notched a total return of 45 percent over the same five years , he said the s p s marketcap metric , he said , causes it to consistently overweight highfliers and to underweight bargainpriced shares in that respect , the tail can wag the dog , causing the index to present a distorted picture of the market , he said the s p 500 gets whipsawed by every bubble when it inflates and when it deflates , he said mr arnott says his index offers a better picture of the stock market s prospects because it underweights overvalued stocks and overweights undervalued shares nomura asset management of japan has licensed the rafi , and mr arnott has developed on a fundamental index for japanese stocks as an alternative to the topix , a japanese index that is also weighted by capitalization powershares plans to start a rafibased etf tomorrow and ftse , a leading provider of global indexes , has recently begun to publish daily updates of the rafi powershares and mr arnott , meanwhile , may be looking over their shoulders at wisdomtree investments , a small financial company based in manhattan the firm , formerly called index development partners , says that it will enter the etf arena with its own custom index funds it has drawn attention by attracting a marquee group of backers and executives wisdomtree is designing enhancedindex products that we feel are superior to what s out there now , said jeremy j siegel , the wharton school finance professor and frequent investment commentator , who is also senior investment strategy adviser to the firm its chief executive is jonathan steinberg , son of the corporate raider saul p steinberg professor siegel is also an investor in the firm others include michael steinhardt , the hedge fund manager , who is the firm s chairman and owns some twothirds of its shares , and the former american express chairman james d robinson iii and his son , james d robinson iv , who serves on the wisdomtree board we have found better indexed products with less risk than the indexes , professor siegel said wisdomtree has several funds that are awaiting approval from the securities and exchange commission the firm has lured several employees from barclays global investors , the kingpin of etf s , which has more than 200 billion in its ishare funds among them is richard f morris , wisdomtree s deputy general counsel still , the idea of consistently outperforming established indexes without taking on extra risk draws skepticism from some people steven schoenfeld , the chief investment strategist for the quantitative division of northern trust global investments , which manages more than 200 billion for pension funds and other institutional clients using indexing strategies , said the powershares approach was a form of quasiactive indexing with bets , intended or unintended in the portfolio the traditional index playbook is discarded , he said , when a significant component of active management is added if you 're getting into one of these funds to outperform , you should also know you can underperform , mr schoenfeld said he said he doubted that the powershares flagship fund could outperform over a full market cycle , because the factors that let it outperform in the past will not stay the same burton g malkiel , the princeton economics professor and author of a random walk down wall street , offered a similar critique of mr arnott s research associates index i accept robert arnott s numbers , and he s really shot the lights out , professor malkiel said , but it s unlikely the index will continue to do as well in the future rafi , he said , has an orientation toward value and smallcap stocks , which is what the last five years in the stock market were all about the overwhelming outperformance of mr arnott s fundamental index versus the s p 500 from 2000 through 2004 reflects the peculiar characteristics of the postbubble stock market , he said , and is not a formula for future outperformance some critics say they still think that the new designer index funds are useful though i'm skeptical , this kind of innovation is appealing , said jim wiandt , editor of the journal of indexes and publisher of indexuniversecom it keeps indexers on their toes and makes sure the indexes are running as efficiently as possible in a similar vein , mr schoenfeld said these are interesting innovative products that can potentially play a role in a portfolio but they are not a substitute for indexing itself the starting point has to be indexing at the core in any event , the debate over how much intelligent life exists in the indexing universe is likely to continue
as worries increase about the possibility of a flu pandemic , public health officials are hoping that this year s flu season will be the first in years with an abundance of vaccines four companies are approved to produce seasonal flu vaccines in the united states this year , and together they are expected to deliver about 90 million doses about as many as have ever been used in a single season but as in previous years , that supply is not yet guaranteed so federal officials have asked doctors and clinics to vaccinate only people age 65 or older , babies and the infirm until oct 24 , when all people will be encouraged to get vaccinated chiron , a california biotechnology company whose entire production of nearly 50 million doses was destroyed last year after worries surfaced over the safety of its manufacturing plant , expects to provide 18 million to 26 million doses this year none of those doses have received approval from the food and drug administration for distribution alison marquiss , a spokeswoman for chiron , said her company would begin delivering doses to customers within the next two weeks ms marquiss said the company expected to hear fairly soon from the drug agency about the approval status of its vaccines len lavenda , a spokesman for the vaccines division of sanofiaventis , a french pharmaceutical company , said his company sold its entire expected production of 60 million doses within three days of seeking orders in march the booking process normally takes months , mr lavenda said sanofiaventis is the only company in recent years that has reliably produced flu vaccines but because of recent shortages , sanofiaventis is shipping customers' orders in batches to ensure that everyone gets at least a partial shipment that has led to some anxiety , said tom skinner , a spokesman for the centers for disease control and prevention supply is not keeping up right now with demand , mr skinner said but he said vaccine manufacturers generally kept delivering doses to customers until early december , so there was no cause for worry all indications are right now that we 're going to have ample supply of vaccine this year , mr skinner said glaxosmithkline , a drug giant based in london , said that it expected to deliver about 8 million doses of flu vaccine , and medimmune , a biotechnology company based in gaithersburg , md , said it would deliver more flumist a vaccine administered into the nose than it did last year , when it made 17 million doses dr charles m helms , chief of staff at the university of iowa hospitals and clinics , said he planned an aggressive campaign this year to immunize much of his own staff , since national surveys showed that just 38 percent of health care workers were immunized against the flu each year dr helms said he hoped that widespread worry about a pandemic flu would increase immunization rates against seasonal flu in thailand , michael o leavitt , secretary of health and human services , began a fournation tour of southeast asia this week in hopes of increasing international cooperation to combat a possible global epidemic of avian flu for all of us , the best defense is containment , mr leavitt said , to find it and find it soon and then work as an international community to contain it that requires all of us to act in a way that is both transparent and cooperative the bush administration s flu plan , a draft of which was obtained by the new york times , predicts that international cooperation will end as soon as a pandemic begins the administration hopes to encourage domestic production of vaccines , the plan says , because other countries are likely to prevent the export of vaccine to the us or elsewhere until national needs are met the plan also suggests that many nations are likely to ask the united states for help in a pandemic however , current limitations of global vaccine manufacturing capacity , drug production and stockpiling , the plan says , and limited stocks of relevant medical equipment , will make it extremely difficult , if not impossible , to provide any materials from any one country mr leavitt urged leaders to increase their own capacities for making vaccines dr jong wook lee , the director general of the world health organization , who was traveling with mr leavitt , said the recent appearance of infected birds in russia and central asia amounted to a worldwide warning about pandemic flu the burning question is , will there be a human influenza pandemic \? dr lee said on behalf of the who , i can tell you that there will be the only question is the virulence and rapidity of transmission from human to human photo marilyn shermer got a flu shot yesterday at newyorkpresbyterian allen hospital people 65 and older have been approved for early vaccines \( photo by mario tama getty images \)
as a member of the union s negotiating committee , brendan shanahan of the detroit red wings helped formulate the national hockey league s new collective bargaining agreement that agreement has largely been viewed as an overwhelming victory for the league and its owners , an opinion that shanahan hears even from athletes from other sports but shanahan , who was in manhattan last week to film an episode of a new show for espn called game night , will have none of it i think we got a great deal , shanahan said over breakfast last tuesday no 1 , i 'll just start off with some of the things that were never taken away that could have been taken away , like guaranteed contracts thank god that never came up shanahan then referred to one of the other participants in the episode he shot last monday night i had cris carter last night telling me that we had the worst deal in sports , shanahan said , referring to the former nfl wide receiver and i was like , 'you 're kidding me , right \? ' it s not true in football , you could sign a fiveyear deal , a 10year deal , a 15year deal , and it does n't mean anything move your kids , get them into school , buy a new house , your wife joins the pta and one month later you 've been cut that is because there are no guaranteed contracts in the nfl still , there is little question that the nhl and its owners got what they wanted the union , which had agreed to a 24 percent rollback of all existing salaries , eventually acceded to a salary cap the nfl and the nba have salary caps , but major league baseball does not the people that think we got the worst deal in sports have not looked at our deal , shanahan said one reason , he said , is the nhl s more liberalized approach to free agency i think a lot of players were really afraid that this was going to be a deal that was really restrictive and that would hurt them , shanahan said , before referring to the recent flurry of activity in the freeagent market and look at the movement ! look at the player signings ! the difference is that they 're not all going to new york , detroit , philadelphia now , the excitement that detroit used to have on july 1 , and new york , now it s happening in columbus and it s happening in nashville and it s happening in atlanta i think when you know there s a ceiling , there s a thought that there will be an end to the madness at some point they were asking me about this last night on the show and i said 'do n't feel sorry for us we 're still doing very well ' as part of its effort to win back an alienated fan base , shanahan said the nhl could use an upstart sport like nascar as an example of how to market its product here are guys that putting their lives on the line getting into a car , and they 're letting guys put microphones in the car , shanahan said and cameras when their engine goes or they have a small accident and are out of the race and they get out of the car , they 're talking to the fans through a cameraman five seconds later when it s still good i 'd stick around to see what that guy would have to say in hockey , there s a cooldown period everything stays in the room do n't give the other team anything to put on their bulletin board so what we do is we have the real good stuff for ourselves and when the camera goes on and we 're speaking to the fans , we give them blah , blah , blah i want to see more highs and lows shanahan , who enters this season ranked 17th on the career list with 558 goals , would also like to see more scoring chances he is a member of the league s joint competition committee , which has been instrumental in rule changes this season among those changes are a reduction in the size of the equipment a goaltender can wear and the removal of the red line at center ice to shanahan , however , the biggest change is a crackdown on obstruction penalties , which the league has tried to several times if there s anyone who doubts whether the nhl is serious this time , he said , just look at the fact that they took probably the best referee off the ice to be the director of officials because they thought he would have a greater impact on each and every game , rather than just the games he was reffing himself he was referring to stephen walkom
singapore , wednesday , july 6 with just hours to go before the final vote , new york s olympic bid organizers unveiled their vision of the 2012 games in a presentation that stressed the city s international flavor , its organizers' enthusiasm and the economic boost the games would give the olympic movement the bid founder , deputy mayor daniel l doctoroff , nervously told the members of the international olympic committee the story of his olympic dream , which began at a world cup soccer match at the meadowlands 11 years ago we are a city that wraps its arms around you , doctoroff said when you score a perfect 10 , the crowd will rise and cheer , no matter where you are from this was new york s last pitch before the 116member ioc chooses the 2012 olympic city from among new york , paris , london , madrid and moscow the new york bid videos included testimony from dozens of athletes , from the tennis star serena williams and the boxer sugar ray leonard to the basketball legend magic johnson and the cycling champion lance armstrong , in describing the plans for the olympic sites president bush appeared via video , as did former president bill clinton mayor michael r bloomberg emphasized that the new olympic stadium plan had been approved let me be clear , we are going ahead and building this stadium , bloomberg said it is going ahead because new yorkers never give up not now , not ever he also strongly emphasized that new york was not in singapore as a setup for a bid in 2016 , a charge the other bid cities have been using against the new york bid as bloomberg introduced senator hillary rodham clinton of new york , she echoed that theme , saying , 2012 is the right time for new york and it s the right time for the world to experience new york both doctoroff and bloomberg veered briefly from the strategy of avoiding mention of the terrorist attacks of sept 11 late in bloomberg s remarks , he highlighted new york s rebound from the tragedy , telling the ioc members that in the aftermath , new yorkers had told themselves , we can recover we will rebuild we must continue to welcome everyone the closing video featured a torch run through the city , including a small snippet that showed a child s handwritten sign outside trinity church it was a drawing of the twin towers and said , in crayon , the sky was so blue the presentation order was decided by random drawing , with each city given 45 minutes for a presentation and 15 minutes to answer questions from ioc members moscow , london and madrid were to follow paris and new york the voting was set to begin at 5 45 am eastern time , with the announcement of the result scheduled to be televised live by nbc at 7 43 am the voting was scheduled to proceed by rounds with the city receiving the least number of votes dropping out after every round the rounds were to proceed until one city had a majority of the votes paris began its presentation to the ioc with a note of humility , a nod to the criticism that its past two bids were too arrogant and had turned off an organization that likes to be wooed mayor bertrand delanoe quickly referred to those previous bids each defeat has served to increase our determination , he said , in french then , in another nod to previous criticisms about the reluctance of the french to speak english , he spoke a few sentences in english i want to thank you for setting the bar so high and pushing us further toward excellence , he said french president jacques chirac , who did not attend the presentation for paris s last bid , in 2001 , made the most emotional appeal he emphasized his long relationship with many ioc members and talked about the french people s desire to host the games i shall vouch for this , he said in french you can put your trust in france you can trust the french you can trust us the video portion of the paris presentation was produced by the french filmmaker luc besson and it had a peculiarly french flair , opening with an aerial tour of the city , showing olympic rings floating around landmarks in the questionandanswer session , ioc members asked about antidoping plans , about guarantees for building the olympic village and , oddly , about the quality of french airconditioning the presentations by the five delegations ended what had become the most expensive campaign ever for an olympic games , with the cities spending an estimated 150 million combined dr jacques rogge , the president of the international olympic committee , had preached in favor of reining in the bid process he had insisted the ioc not add new sports like golf until others were dropped and he said he wanted to keep the games manageable enough for a country in africa to play host one day but the 2012 campaign only underlined how far the ioc is from achieving rogge s goals new york city s efforts alone cost 35 million , doctoroff said , all of it raised from private donations the other cities did not release the amounts they spent , but all of them staged similarly expansive campaigns to top it off , some ioc members say they believe that on thursday , none of the 28 summer olympic sports will be voted off the program , leaving the games as large and as costly as ever rogge , at a news conference this week , tried to put the best face on the bid process when i am asked who will be the winner , i am always inclined to say the winner will be the international olympic committee , rogge said but he admitted to wincing at the size of the campaigns , which included cities' flying dozens of celebrity guests , elite athletes and highprofile politicians to singapore for the final days of lobbying i like to see olympic champions , but i do n't think the whole candidature process must be one of glitter and stars , he said we like to see the support of the government authorities and the support of the sports , so if they are bringing leaders and sports stars , fine that is not a problem the last days of the race for the games drew the president of france , the prime ministers of britain , russia and spain , as well as spain s queen sof a new york had senator hillary rodham clinton lend her star power the british prime minister , tony blair , spent two and a half days here before flying back to scotland on tuesday night to serve as host for the g8 summit meeting , which begins today in many ways , the olympic movement cannot help itself it seems magnetically drawn to anything big , favoring elaborate opening ceremonies and grand gestures like aroundtheworld torch relays while giving press credentials to nearly 15 , 000 news media representatives for the summer games , which usually feature 10 , 000 athletes peter ueberroth , the united states olympic committee chairman who oversaw the 1984 games in los angeles , the first moneymaking olympics in history , was one of those sounding a note of caution the 1984 games did not receive government money or donations and were financed entirely by sponsorships , television revenue , merchandising and ticket sales eight years after the 1976 games nearly bankrupted montreal , the profits realized in los angeles were considered a phenomenal achievement rogge said that since then every games has turned an operational profit the overall ioc marketing revenue has increased by 31 percent , reaching 866 million for 200509 television rights revenue has jumped to 35 billion for the 2010 winter games and the 2012 summer games ueberroth is among those who say he does not believe such increases will continue and that the next television contracts may shrink as networks struggle to make sports broadcasts as profitable as they once were i think the ioc is coming to realize , hopefully , that they need to put some restraints on that or it will backfire , ueberroth said no longer , he added , will cities keep bidding until they get the games if the costs keep going up
amsterdam , oct 3 in the five months since microsoft unveiled a prototype of its new video game machine , the xbox 360 , the company has tried to generate excitement by staging demonstrations of the console s ability to play music and display digital photographs and by trumpeting its online community features yet as microsoft has tried to build buzz for the 360 , the most important ingredient has largely been missing games there have been flashy screenshots and impressive trailers but since the game industry s big trade show in los angeles in may , microsoft has shown little of actual , playable games so far , microsoft has done little to convince hardcore gamers that the 360 will be a mustbuy this holiday season microsoft means to change that in a big way , starting now on tuesday and wednesday , more than 1 , 000 journalists , analysts and game industry executives are gathering here at x05 , microsoft s game exhibition , to see and play the games that the company hopes will propel the 360 into millions of homes in its first few months on shelves the machine will reach stores on nov 22 and cost 300 for a barebones model and 400 with accessories dan hsu , editor in chief of electronic gaming monthly , one of the top video game magazines , said , they have shown a lot of other stuff like the community functions , but this is the one chance for microsoft to really wow everybody and get people excited about the games and convince the industry that xbox 360 will truly deliver a nextgeneration experience clearly , the hope is that the people in amsterdam can then pass along that buzz to the consumers microsoft will try to create demand for its new machine by showing that its own game development operation is a budding hit factory games that microsoft will publish for the 360 , like gears of war , kameo and perfect dark zero , will be scrutinized closely by the industry microsoft is also expected to announce this week several new projects to be published by microsoft , including a game called crackdown that is under development by real time worlds the crackdown announcement is likely to generate interest because one of the main developers at real time worlds , david jones , helped start the team that invented the wildly successful grand theft auto franchise as well as the popular lemmings game series microsoft definitely has a challenge ahead of them , said sid shuman , a producer for gamesnet , a game community web site microsoft responds fairly well to challenges , but they need to convince people that this system can deliver game play that simply is n't possible on the current generation that goes beyond graphics to elements like realistic physics , so if i want to roll a grenade under a car , for example , i can do that even as microsoft champions its own games , the company is also eager to show that independent game publishers are enthusiastic about writing games for the 360 system for example , ubisoft , the big french game company , plans to announce that its bestselling tactical combat game franchise , tom clancy s splinter cell , will be available for the 360 next year many analysts agree that developers have had a positive response to the 360 yet pauljon mcnealy , a video game analyst for american technology research , said that some game makers might delay the release of 360 games until after the holidays , fearing market saturation of all of the games at this week s event , none will be watched more closely than perfect dark zero when the original xbox was released in 2001 , only about 15 games were available one of them , halo , became a megahit that was almost singlehandedly responsible for the xbox s initial success perfect dark zero , another shooting game , may become the marquee title for the 360 , though microsoft hopes that more than 25 games for the 360 will be available this year microsoft demonstrated perfect dark zero at the electronic entertainment expo convention in may , but the game received a mixed review from industry experts because the game s graphics did not appear to be significantly better than the graphics in older games microsoft executives , however , say the production version of the 360 is much more powerful than the prototype used in may , and games like perfect dark zero look much better now than they did earlier in the year now , we feel we are in a position to demonstrate what we are really capable of , said peter moore , microsoft s top xbox marketing executive the xbox 360 will have the advantage of reaching the market at least several months before its main competitors , the playstation 3 from sony and nintendo s new revolution console , which are both expected next year in fact , evan wilson , an analyst with pacific crest securities , said that demand for the 360 had already exceeded his earlier projections , and sales could make microsoft s game division profitable over the holiday quarter but the 360 s ability to overtake sony , which dominates the game console market , by arriving first in stores is far from a sure thing analysts said that the first buyers of the 360 almost certainly would be hardcore gamers who would probably buy both a 360 and a playstation 3 , if not a revolution as well the earlier movers are n't making a decision between the two , said michael pachter , an analyst with wedbush morgan securities over all , analysts said they expected microsoft to sell 2 million to 3 million consoles over the holidays , including as many as 15 million in north america
washington , july 20 he is the son of a company man , and he has lived a loyalist s life his teachers remember him as the brightest of boys , but his classmates say he never lorded it over them he was always conservative , but not doctrinaire he was raised and remains a practicing roman catholic who declines , friends say , to wear his faith on his sleeve and like his first judicial mentor , henry j friendly of the federal appeals court in new york , john g roberts is an erudite , harvardtrained , republican corporatelawyerturnedjudge , with a punctilious , pragmatic view of the law i do not have an allencompassing approach to constitutional interpretation the appropriate approach depends to some degree on the specific provision at issue , judge roberts wrote in response to a written question during his 2003 confirmation to the federal appeals court in washington some provisions of the constitution provide considerable guidance on how they should be construed others are less precise i would not hew to a particular school' of interpretation , he added , but would follow the approach or approaches that seemed most suited in the particular case to correctly discerning the meaning of the provision at issue from his childhood as the son of a plant manager for bethlehem steel and a standout student through his career as a judge and lawyer for the government and private corporations , friends , colleagues and teachers say judge roberts has taken life one step and one case at a time laurence h tribe , a liberal professor of constitutional law at harvard , remembers judge roberts as a student there and has kept in touch with him over the years he does not recall judge roberts as a political conservative when he studied there he s conservative in manner and conservative in approach , mr tribe said he s a person who is cautious and careful , that s true but he is also someone quite deeply immersed in the law , and he loves it he believes in it as a discipline and pursues it in principle and not by way of politics in his 2003 written testimony , judge roberts cited justices oliver wendell holmes , louis d brandeis , felix frankfurter , robert h jackson and john marshall among the supreme court judges he most admired one was a republican , three were democrats and one was a federalist , but all were deeply influential in their day , and all would make any law professor s short list of alltime greats judge roberts s friends say his approach to the rest of his life is similarly embracing when i look at the people who were his friends , and who are his friends , there s not a political component to it that i can detect , said charles e davidow , another law school classmate who roomed with him when they were both clerking , for separate judges , in new york it s not as if his friends are all conservative , or all liberal , or all anything else his friends are his friends , and he s not the kind of personality where conversations with him tend to turn political judge roberts is indisputably a republican he advised gov jeb bush of florida during the 2000 presidential vote recount gave 1 , 000 to george w bush that year and contributed about 2 , 700 to various republican candidates over the years but he has given more almost 7 , 500 to his law firm s political action committee , which supports democrats and republicans in roughly equal measure in a law school class that included one current senator , russell d feingold , a wisconsin democrat , and one former one , spencer abraham , a republican from michigan at least two congressmen and countless managing partners of the nation s leading law firms , judge roberts always stood out , but not apart though he earned more than 1 million a year by the time he left the bluechip washington law firm of hogan hartson to go on the bench two years ago , he often ate lunch in the firm cafeteria , chatting with coworkers and junior colleagues there are partners who spend that kind of time , and there are partners who do n't , said patricia a brannan , a partner at hogan he always made time paul mogin was a year behind judge roberts at harvard law school and his roommate there for two years he followed judge roberts as judge friendly s clerk on the court of appeals for the second circuit and chose him as the best man at his wedding by temperament , he s not a flamethrower , not somebody you 'd expect to willingly or readily overrule a precedent , mr mogin said he s somebody who has respect for institutions i think institutions have been important to him in his life , like harvard , the catholic church and the supreme court he s not likely to be anybody to do anything too radical as early as elementary school , john g roberts stood out as the smartest kid in class he regularly scored 100 s , took five years of latin in four years of high school , had his essays read aloud as examples for his peers dorothea liddell , his eighthgrade math teacher at notre dame , a catholic school in the small town of long beach , ind , where judge roberts grew up , said she used young john as a barometer as she experimented with the unfamiliar curriculum known as new math if he understood the concept , i was good , mrs liddell remembered wednesday as she sat in one of the school s unairconditioned classrooms , reminiscing with several former students if not , teach it all over again born in buffalo , judge roberts arrived in long beach , a flagbedecked town of 1 , 500 residents on the shore of lake michigan , around fourth grade with his parents when his father , john sr , helped open the bethlehem steel mill in burns harbor , a halfhour s drive away at first the family john and his three sisters , cathy , peggy and barbara lived by the lake amid the summer cottages of wealthy families from chicago , about 60 miles away but in 1965 , the family built a brown splitlevel house with five bedrooms on a quiet street a couple of blocks away like other steel executives' children , john roberts went to private school , first next door to his family s parish at notre dame , and then to an allboys boarding school , la lumiere , a bucolic retreat on a pond in nearby laporte besides being an academic star , he was a scrappy athlete , a captain of the football team despite his mediocre play , and competed in wrestling and track in a small school of about 125 students , john roberts was also on the student council executive committee \( he lost the race for senior class president to his best friend \) , the student activities committee , the editorial board of the torch student newspaper and the drama club the school yearbook from 1972 , his junior year , shows he played peppermint patty in the production of you 're a good man , charlie brown he impressed almost everyone lawrence sullivan , his high school math teacher , recalled on wednesday , it became very , very clear and evident when he first came here that he was a person who was destined to do big things though judge roberts at first aspired to be a history professor a former roommate said he chose harvard over amherst intending to combine undergraduate work with a phd he showed early signs of the skills that would serve him so well as a litigator the english teacher used to talk about his papers after he had written them because they were outrageous but very well crafted , remembered john langley , an emergency room doctor in new orleans who was a class below judge roberts at la lumiere he could take an argument that was borderline absurd and argue for it so well that you were almost at the point of having to accept his stance even though it was intuitively obvious that it was absurd few people remember him or his parents having much interest in political activity , though mr sullivan said he had a conservative bent , in contrast to the faculty at la lumiere asked how her son became a solid conservative , rosemary roberts said , i do n't know , only god will know , but she said her son s views are shared by other family members the elder robertses now live in a golfcourse community in ellicott city , md , near baltimore , and she recalled we were very concerned about the news and everything we have always been a family that was interested in things other than ourselves in his senior year , in david kirkby s morals class , john roberts went beyond a simple bookreport assignment to pore through a dense set of seven philosophy tomes , then proceeded to hold forth for several class periods while some of his classmates struggled to fill a few minutes if bells had n't rung to end the class , he could probably be still talking now , 32 years later , mr kirkby said , laughing , on wednesday tenacity was a hallmark on the football field too he was n't that big , he was n't that fast , but he was n't bashful about butting his head against guys three times his size , said bob maclaverty , who beat john roberts in that student council election , but remained close enough friends that they stood at each other s weddings john roberts and john langley worked summers at the burns harbor mill on the floor , not in offices , like their fathers they were downanddirty jobs , but they paid well , and the kids had to learn how to take a riding from the regular employees who were not going to college , recalled mr langley s mother , joan beth linnen , a former classmate at notre dame elementary school , still remembers john roberts s nerdy glasses and winning smile if you said to me , 'who was the smartest kid in your gradeschool class \? ' i would have said , 'john roberts , ' ms linnen said some kids who are smart are sort of geeky , but he just got along with everyone andy mckenna , who is now chairman of the illinois republican party , was two years behind judge roberts at la lumiere , yet well aware of his academic legend when he got things wrong , people thought there might be something wrong with the teacher , not with him , because he was so off the charts , mr mckenna said on wednesday not many people could keep up with him the same was true at harvard college , where judge roberts graduated summa cum laude in 1976 , and harvard law school , which he entered that fall richard lazarus , a law school friend , tells the story of a mutual friend , a fellow student who made the mistake of joining john s study group first year after two weeks , the friend was miserable he thought he may well have made a serious mistake because he was n't good enough , said mr lazarus , now a law professor at georgetown university then he started studying with some other people and he thought , 'wait a minute i'm not the problem' it was because he was studying with john judge roberts , said mr lazarus , worked all the time and held himself to high , high standards one day , john was worrying that he had n't done well on an exam i said 'john , i 'll bet you 25 you got at least an aminus on the exam' he would n't take the bet it shows you what he was like the rest of us would have been perfectly happy with the aminus by all accounts , during his harvard years , judge roberts excelled academically but also stood out for his eventempered nature and his ability to engage with people with many different viewpoints many of his law school classmates were aware that judge roberts was somewhat conservative in outlook , but , they say , he was not politically active he was , i would say , conservative in the oldfashioned sense , not the new modern sense , said bill kayatta , a lifelong democrat who served on the law review with judge roberts he had a sort of thoughtful respect for institutions , history , precedent , a willingness to consider change but not revolutionary he believed in having some humility about one s ability to suddenly decree that those who came before you were wrong , but he was not a stick in the mud either mr kayatta added john and i probably spent several hundred hours debating every issue known to humankind , coming from very different perspectives on many issues he s the type of person you could debate any issue with , and you could sometimes change his mind and sometimes he would change yours he was brilliant , but modest , the latter being unusual at harvard law school he was someone who s just softspoken and brilliant , but yet very interested in what other people had to say by the time judge roberts got to the law school , the cambridge campus was no longer the radicalized haven of liberalism it had been during the vietnam war era , several former students said representative john barrow , democrat of georgia and a law school classmate , recalls those years as almost a happy time between the activism of the 60 s and the hostile time of the 80 s , when the faculty was deeply divided over the curriculum and legal studies judge roberts s views did not much stand out he was more conservative than others , mr barrow said , but to be honest , i ca n't remember having any political discussions representative brad sherman , democrat of california , who worked on jimmy carter s presidential campaign as a firstyear student , did not know his classmate that well i could n't tell you whether he inhaled or did n't , he said i did n't hang out with the smart kids don deamicis , another classmate who is now a partner at ropes and gray in boston , said the law school of that era could not be described as a conservative institution , but i do n't think that those who were more conservative felt alienated by the institution indeed , stephen galebach , now a lawyer in andover , mass , arrived at the law school after a stint in the marines , described himself as a reaganite conservative and said i fit quite naturally it s not like i took guff from people people were interested in interesting things about people mr galebach recalled that he was more politically outspoken than judge roberts ever was on campus from our time in law review , it was n't like john was a gungho conservative , he said he was n't active he was n't a gungho liberal on liberal causes he was always more focused more on the craftsmanship of the law mr galebach said the fact that judge roberts s position at the law review was managing editor tells a lot about john he added managing editor is the one who just makes sure everything is done to a high level of quality it s the ultimate position of not injecting your own views , but allowing other people to reach high levels of scholarship judge roberts himself wrote two notes for the review , one on the constitution s contracts clause and the other on the takings clause , but mostly edited the work of professors and legal scholars who contributed after graduation , judge roberts went to clerk for judge friendly , the former presiding judge of the appeals court in new york who by then was winding down his long career but was still widely regarded as the preeminent appeals court judge of his era judge friendly , too , had graduated summa cum laude from harvard and harvard law school , where he had studied under justice frankfurter before clerking for justice brandeis on the supreme court working for justice brandeis , judge friendly had helped with his famous dissent in olmstead v united states , in which justice brandeis argued that the government had violated a bootlegger s constitutional rights by wiretapping his telephone in ringing language that decades later would help form the basis for a string of privacy rights rulings by the court , justice brandeis argued that the framers had conferred , as against the government , the right to be let alone the most comprehensive of rights , and the right most valued by civilized men after work as a lawyer for pan american world airways , judge friendly was appointed to the federal bench by president dwight d eisenhower and was sometimes frustrated by the liberal activism of the supreme court under chief justice earl warren he was famous for writing his own opinions , which often found their way into casebooks , and asking his clerks not for written memos but for oral defenses of their ideas he had a proper view of the limited role of judges , another former clerk , robert weiner , now a lawyer in washington , said of judge friendly he had a guiding principle that when deciding a case , a judge should always think about how the ruling would be cited back at you in the next case he was n't going to vary his principles from case to case , just because he may have liked the facts differently he often decided cases in ways he would have preferred not to mr mogin said that judge friendly , who died in 1986 , had his favorite former clerks , and roberts was always one of them judge roberts s next assignment was a clerkship for a more conservative judge , chief justice william h rehnquist , then an associate justice of the supreme court , before joining the reagan administration as an aide to attorney general william french smith mr lazarus , who roomed with judge roberts back then , said he was not apolitical during the 1980 presidential election , we were roommates and we had a presidential election party , and he had put an elephant on the tv and i put a donkey , mr lazarus said but , he added , judge roberts said to me a long time ago there was no case he had been on where he could n't have done the other side judge roberts later worked as an associate in the white house counsel s office in the reagan administration before entering private practice at hogan hartson in 1986 , then returning to government service as principal deputy solicitor general in the first bush administration , helping to argue its positions before the supreme court in both jobs , he took positions on behalf of clients that he has said should not necessarily be attributed to him , insisting in his confirmation hearing two years ago , my practice has not been ideological in any sense my clients and their positions are liberal and conservative across the board in private practice , he has represented some of the world s biggest automakers , the national collegiate athletic association and the national mining association but it is his work in the solicitor general s office that has drawn some of the sharpest early criticism from the liberal advocacy groups that are scrutinizing his comparatively limited public record in 1991 , he signed a brief asking the court to lower the wall of separation between church and state the government had asked the supreme court to discard an earlier test and overturn a lower court ruling that held a clergyman could not give an official address at a junior high school graduation in providence , ri it asked the court to rule that civic acknowledgments of religion in public life do not offend the establishment clause of the constitution as long as they neither threaten the establishment of an official religion nor coerce participation in religious activities at the time , officials in the first bush administration told reporters that the reason for intervening was a tactical decision to try to draw out justice david h souter , then the court s newest member , and get him on the side of the administration , which was hoping eventually to change the approach to religion in public settings in the end , the court voted 5 to 4 against the administration and upheld the lower court s decision among those in the majority were justice souter and justice sandra day o'connor , whose seat judge roberts has been nominated to fill barry w lynn , the executive director of americans united for separation of church and state , said wednesday that judge roberts s participation in the case makes him unsuited for a seat on the us supreme court he said that if confirmed to the court , judge roberts would open the door to majority rule on religious matters friends of judge roberts and his wife , jane sullivan roberts , a lawyer at pillsbury winthrop shaw pittman , say they share a strong faith they are deeply religious , said fred f fielding , the former white house counsel for president reagan , but they do n't wear it on their sleeves at all the couple are members of the church of the little flower in bethesda , md , a catholic congregation that includes about 1 , 500 families like many washingtonarea churches , its members have included prominent political figures thomas o'neill , the former speaker of the house known as tip , as well as edmund muskie , the former united states senator , secretary of state and presidential candidate , once attended , said gary r davies , a church deacon more recently , l paul bremer iii , who served as the united states' administrator in iraq , was a member the church , mr davies said , is not particularly political , though it does organize two or so busloads of members each year to participate in an antiabortion rally marking the roe v wade decision i have never heard anyone talk about politics , mr davies said it just does not belong some who know judge roberts say he does not let his personal beliefs affect his legal views he s not going to allow political or theological interference with his opinions , said mark touhey , a partner in the texas law firm of vinson elkins shannen w coffin , a friend of judge roberts and a former justice department lawyer , said john s faith is his faith , and his approach to the law is a separate issue if it has any effect , it is in the sense of restraint , that he is not and the role of the judge is not to be the center of the universe it stems from the sort of humility of a faithful person the robertses frequently attend events at the college of the holy cross , in worcester , mass jane roberts is a graduate of the school and has been a trustee for the last four years they are devout catholics , said the rev michael c mcfarland , the college president they are not the kind of people who would be in your face , he added their religion would affect their personal lives , but they are very professional in their work mr coffin said that after the robertses married nine years ago when they were both in their 40 s , they tried to have children after a several failed adoption efforts , he said , they got lucky with two children , josephine and john , now 5 and 4 in a sign of just how small the elite world of the supreme court bar and bench can be , the robertses have attended holy cross events with justice clarence thomas and his wife , virginia , according to father mcfarland justice thomas is also an alumnus of holy cross and a trustee i know they know each other , said father mcfarland , but he added he did n't know how well both couples , the holy cross president said , know msgr peter vaghi , who married the robertses in 1996 in washington and now is the pastor at the bethesda church where the robertses worship monsignor vaghi serves as the chaplain of the john carroll society , a 51yearold washingtonbased charitable and social organization judge roberts s wife is a member of the board of governors , as is mary ellen bork , the wife of judge robert h bork , whose nomination to the supreme court was bitterly opposed by democrats and failed in 1987 there is little in judge roberts s known record to suggest he could ever be so polarizing a figure in his confirmation testimony two years ago , he said that judges should be ever mindful that they are insulated from democratic pressures precisely because the framers expected them to be discerning law , not shaping policy , and added that means that judges should not look to their own personal views or preferences in deciding the cases before them their commission is no license to impose their preferences from the bench that is not to say that judge roberts has a low opinion of his own persuasive powers , as a lawyer before the court or a justice on it his friends note that he often recounts the story of losing a supreme court case with none of the justices ruling in his favor unable to explain to his client why he had lost 9 to 0 , he finally said , because there are only nine justices on the court
though mstislav rostropovich is one of the towering musicians of our time , as a conductor , even in his prime years , he has never been an incisive technician powerful musical instincts , an eternally youthful sense of adventure and a deep connection to the tradition are what have always mattered in mr rostropovich s podium performances , especially in the russian repertory on wednesday night at the new york philharmonic , mr rostropovich , still physically nimble and full of energy at 78 , conducted a program of works by shostakovich and prokofiev , including two concertos with the stupendous , though always unpredictable , pianist martha argerich shostakovich and prokofiev were teachers and mentors to the young mr rostropovich in the soviet union no conductor i can think of could have brought more passion and authority to these works than he did he began with shostakovich s festive overture , a sixminute work composed in 1954 for a concert to celebrate the 37th anniversary of the october revolution the score is generally considered an exuberant curtainraiser , a riff on rossini but mr rostropovich was having none of that the performance he drew from the philharmonic players was breathless and ecstatic , especially when he turned to the audience to signal two batteries of extra brass in the balconies to join in for the final push to the blazing coda then ms argerich appeared for a performance of shostakovich s concerto no 1 in c minor for piano , trumpet and strings \( 1933 \) , with philip smith as the splendid trumpet soloist , followed by prokofiev s piano concerto no 1 in d flat \( 1911 \) this volatile artist is often at her best in concertos , when her temperamental wildness is reined in by a conductor but mr rostropovich is not a reiningin sort if anything , he emboldened ms argerich to play with fullout intensity and maximum expressivity at times in both works , things got a little rough but who cared when the performances were so exciting and dangerous \? for all the restless fervor of her playing , ms argerich managed to convey beautifully the neoclassical elements of the shostakovich other pianists must surely marvel at her rippling scales , her light and nimble repeated chords , her ability to bring out a thumpy bass line in her left hand while executing filigrees of unimaginable delicacy in her right hand she and mr rostropovich were clearly inspiring each other in prokofiev s scintillating concerto , the composer s first mature work , 20 minutes of music chock full of ideas in the climax of the driving final section the coordination between the piano and the orchestra threatened to fall apart but mr rostropovich kept a steady hand and brought the work to its heady conclusion the audience responded with a frenzied you might say argerichian ovation the program ended with a glowing and vibrant , if not always exacting , account of prokofiev s wistful symphony no 7 in c sharp minor talk about connection to tradition when prokofiev completed this work in 1952 , young mr rostropovich was living with the composer and his wife the program repeats tonight and tomorrow night at avery fisher hall , lincoln center , \( 212 \) 8755656
washington , april 20 with rankandfile republicans showing increasing unease about an impasse paralyzing the house ethics committee , the panel s chairman pledged on wednesday to begin an immediate investigation into the conduct of representative tom delay if democrats dropped their opposition to new ethics rules we are all prepared to vote at the earliest opportunity to impanel an investigation subcommittee to review various allegations concerning travel and other actions by mr delay , said the chairman , representative doc hastings , republican of washington , who was accompanied by three of the four other republicans on the panel democrats quickly rejected the overture , saying mr hastings s personal guarantee of the inquiry and other adjustments to the disputed rules were insufficient democratic leaders said the proposed compromise would still leave in place new rules that they say undermine ethics enforcement and allow partyline dismissal of complaints it is a calculated attempt to divert attention from the fact that the republican majority has neutered the ethics committee in the house by imposing partisan rules that hamstring any meaningful inquiry , said representative steny h hoyer of maryland , the no 2 democrat in the house the exchange illustrated the rising tension in the house over the ethics panel at a time when mr delay , the majority leader , is under scrutiny for overseas travel and other conduct that could fall under the purview of the committee , which admonished him three times last year but after republicans replaced some panel members this year and forced through rules changes , democrats have blocked the committee from organizing itself , effectively suspending any work representative alan b mollohan of west virginia , the senior democrat on the panel , is pushing a proposal to reverse the rules and said wednesday that a third republican , walter b jones of north carolina , had joined christopher shays of connecticut and joel hefley of colorado in agreeing to back him and all the house democrats other republicans privately express reservations about the way the rules were enacted and say their leadership is going to have to find a way to break the impasse it is indefensible , said one senior republican , who did not want to be identified for fear of antagonizing the leadership , about the rules changes mr delay has said he would like to appear before the ethics panel to clear up questions about his travel , and he urged a compromise for more than a month i 've said i hope for a fair process that will afford me the opportunity to get the facts out and set the record straight , mr delay said on wednesday in a statement i welcome the opportunity to address this with the committee news reports and watchdog groups have raised questions about foreign trips taken by mr delay , asserting that they may have been paid for by a lobbyist , which would be a violation of house rules for a second consecutive week , the house leadership sought to hold support for the ethics changes during a private session of the republican membership on wednesday , distributing a memorandum on the rationale for the rules revisions with the title , the issue is fairness speaker j dennis hastert , whose office drafted the changes at the center of the fight , has said the revisions were devised to protect lawmakers' rights better after mr hastings made his offer , mr hastert accused democrats of using the ethics dispute as a political weapon as long as the democrats wo n't let the ethics committee form , they have it both ways , mr hastert said during an interview on the radio program of the commentator sean hannity tom ca n't go before them and ca n't clear himself , and none of their members go before the ethics committee either he said there were four or five potential ethics cases involving toplevel democrats under one of the new rules , ethics complaints could be automatically dismissed if the evenly divided committee did not agree on how to proceed after 45 days in response to democratic concerns of potential stonewalling of complaints , mr hastings offered wednesday to guarantee that any investigation extend at least three months and that no complaint would be dismissed without a vote this should remove any doubt about the true intent of these rules changes , said mr hastings , who said he hoped the committee could move forward at a meeting scheduled for thursday they were designed to treat all members more fairly , not to protect any individual member from any action by the committee but mr mollohan , who is calling for a bipartisan task force to agree on rules changes , said guaranteeing a vote would still create the possibility of a 5to5 deadlock in the 10member committee even with mr hastings s commitments , mr mollohan said , the new rules would undermine seriously the ability of the ethics committee to do their job

for the first time in the 80year history of the new yorker magazine , a single advertiser will sponsor an entire issue the aug 22 issue of the new yorker , due out monday , will carry 17 or 18 advertising pages , all brought to you by the target discount store chain owned by the target corporation the target ads will even supplant the miniads from mailorder marketers that typically fill small spaces in the back of the magazine the target ads , in the form of illustrations by more than two dozen artists like milton glaser , robert risko and ruben toledo , are to run only the one time in the issue they are intended to salute new york city and the people who live and shop there many mainstream magazines like time and life have published what are known as singlesponsor issues , carrying ads only from marketers like kraft foods and progressive insurance target has been a sole sponsor before of issues of magazines , among them people the goal of a singlesponsor issue is the same as it is when an advertiser buys all the commercial time in an episode of a television series attract attention by uncluttering the ad environment we try to do breakthrough things in many different places , minda gralnek , vice president and creative director at target in minneapolis , said in a telephone interview 'expect more pay less' is our mantra , ms gralnek said , quoting the target slogan , and this is part of 'expect more' it s not ordinary the drawings in the target ads will feature subway motifs , street and park scenes , a dog walker , a cocktail party , even a bridge rendered as a shoe all the ads , not surprisingly , feature the target bull seye logo in one way or another , like a giant game of ring toss with the target targets circling a skyscraper we had a list of new york icons that might appear in the ads , ms gralnek said , but in the end these were the rules we gave the artists the ads had to use the target bull seye and had to have new york themes the artists were also asked to draw using only three colors to help the ads stand out red and white , for the target logo , and black neither target nor the new yorker , part of the cond nast publications division of advance publications , would discuss what the sponsorship cost a look at the magazine s rate card suggests that a retailer like target , which has advertised steadily in the new yorker since 2003 , would pay a bit under 11 million for the ads but it is unclear whether a discount retailer whose slogan is expect more pay less would pay , uh , retail for those worried that the new yorker may be blurring the line between editorial content and commercialism , executives of the magazine and target offered reassurances that there would be no equivalent of the new yorker mascot , eustace tilley , staring at a butterfly through a monocle covered with a target bull seye the editorial integrity of our product is a big thing , david carey , vice president and publisher of the new yorker , said in an interview at his office in times square people often say , 'we 'd like to do something in the new yorker that s never been done before , ' but we have high standards , mr carey said there are some ads we do n't accept if they break the format of the magazine so while the new yorker will run a few scent strips a year and gatefold cover ads , he added , the magazine has rejected ads in formats like the dutch door , when a front cover , split in two , unfolds to reveal an ad inside target was not told in advance what the editorial contents or the cover of the issue would be , mr carey said , and there is to be no editorial acknowledgement of the sponsorship \( an ad identifying the illustrators is to run in the back pages of the issue \) the ads were designed to look different from the cartoons that decorate the pages of the new yorker , mr carey said for example , none of the ads are to have captions mr carey said that he informed the editor of the new yorker , david remnick , that the issue would have target as its sole sponsor and that the arrangement would not affect the editorial department in any way mr remnick , asked for a response , replied in an email message , ads are ads , and i have no problem at all with target s advertising a lot , all at once , or a page at a time target and the new yorker have been planning the issue for several months , working to find a week when the magazine could clear out all its other advertisers the midaugust date was an easier time to do it , mr carey said , because if you want to own an entire issue there are typically fewer advertisers during the dog days of summer than , say , during the holiday shopping season the few advertisers that had initially booked ad space in the aug 22 issue are being shifted to the aug 29 issue , mr carey said in addition to the ads that will run on the pages of the aug 22 issue , there will also be a target ad under the flaps that wrap the covers of the issues to be sold on newsstands the new yorker issue joins a lengthy list of catchy marketing and promotional ploys from target they include opening socalled popup stores , which remain in business only a few weeks decorating the outsides of office buildings with oversize target billboards and hiring acrobats and dancers last month to walk down the side of 30 rockefeller center in a vertical fashion show many of target s special ads are aimed at new york city for reasons that include a desire to burnish the image of its stores among fashionistas in the garment district and burnish the image of its corporate parent on wall street there are five target stores in three new york city boroughs the bronx , brooklyn and queens so far , to contradict a famous lorenz hart lyric , target does not have manhattan \( or staten island \) ms gralnek said she was aware that some manhattan shoppers , seeing all the target ads in a borough that has no target stores , have expressed frustration if it does make some people want a target more , that s not a bad thing , ms gralnek said , adding that they could get to the other stores in the outer boroughs or visit the 53 target stores in the metropolitan new york area , including long island and new jersey true , but is there a magazine called the long islander , or the new jerseyan \?
few mutual fund managers beat the stock market over the long term that sad truth is widely understood , and it helps to account for the vast popularity of index funds , which aspire only to match the returns of a particular market but a new study suggests that it may be too soon to give up on actively managed mutual funds while few managers can outpace the market as it moves up and down , year in and year out , substantial numbers can predictably outperform it during parts of the economic cycle , the study has found and investors who are willing and able to make frequent switches among top funds may be able to make some money from this insight the study , called investing in mutual funds when returns are predictable , is forthcoming in the journal of financial economics its authors are doron avramov and russ wermers , finance professors at the university of maryland a copy is at http papersssrncom sol3 paperscfm \? abstractid 555462 in the past , the professors say , most mutual fund research assumed that managers' ability or inability to outperform the market was constant , regardless of the waxing and waning of the market cycle but the professors made a different assumption that significant numbers of managers may have marketbeating ability at some stages of the economic cycle but not at others a manager who can beat the market during a recession , for example , or in periods of high inflation , may well lag behind it in periods of robust economic growth or low inflation these managers will never be found by comparing their longterm performances with a market average , the professors said the managers' stellar gains in parts of a cycle will tend to be offset by poor performance at other times as a result , their longterm records will be unexceptional the professors designed complex tests , hoping to find managers with such parttime promise specifically , they correlated funds' returns with four macroeconomic variables that previous studies found to be good leading indicators the 90day treasury bill rate , the stock market s dividend yield , the difference between the interest rates of junk bonds and higherquality issues \( the socalled default spread \) and the rate difference between longerterm treasuries and 90day treasury bills \( the term spread \) as they expected , the professors found that the typical manager s likelihood of beating the market was strongly related to these four variables professor wermers estimates that as many as a third of the fund managers in the study showed marketbeating ability during at least some phase of the market cycle that compares with just 10 percent of managers who , he said , were able to beat the market s overall return over the last two decades how can this help investors beat the market \? to find out , the professors built a hypothetical portfolio that invested each month in the noload funds that historically performed the best when the four macroeconomic variables were similar to that month s readings they backtested the portfolio from 1980 through 2002 , being careful to use only the information that was publicly available going into each month the professors say they were startled by this model portfolio s large and consistent returns over the 23 years not only did the model outperform the overall market by eight percentage points a year , on average , but it also handily beat a benchmark portfolio of funds that was similar to it in three ways in its risk level , in the market capitalization of its holdings and in its place on the growthtovalue spectrum the professors also compared their portfolio s gain with that of several strategies that previous research had found to have marketbeating potential none of those others came close the professors' strategy does come with significant caveats about its realworld profitability because the portfolio is rebalanced monthly , it can require frequent switching among funds according to professor wermers , the average holding period of funds in the portfolio was only about four months , so almost all the capital gains would be taxed at the higher shortterm rate that means the strategy works better in taxdeferred accounts and what happens if a fund under consideration imposes huge fees or other restrictions on frequent shortterm trading , as some funds have started to do \? in such a case , the professors would simply avoid the fund after all , professor wermers says , there are still plenty of funds that do n't have such restrictions but do have managers that can beat the market during part of a cycle the professors concede that their strategy is probably more appropriate for institutions than for individual investors , because it requires the application of complex statistics to a large database of fund returns still , the research can teach us not to be too quick to conclude from the fund industry s dismal longterm record that virtually no managers have marketbeating ability or that it never makes sense to invest in an actively managed fund strategies mark hulbert is editor of the hulbert financial digest , a service of marketwatch email strategy nytimescom
is there no limit to the ignominies that we will visit upon the noble hamburger \? no end to our restless inventions \? it asks for nothing more than a condiment or two , maybe a slice of mild cheese and of course a doughy cradle it wants respect for what it is , not a trufflestrewn transformation into what it never aspired to be it warrants worship in its purest form those are some of my thoughts about the hamburger , and i confess to thinking about the hamburger more often and more ardently than any nominally sane omnivore should i am by no means alone , a fact made clear by the regular publication of detailed surveys of this city s burger landscape the fatty peaks , the lean valleys i have perused this research for years , and for years my response has been the same peter luger does a burger \? how can i possibly rest until i 've tried it \? peter luger does its burger only at lunch , which is why it s an easy burger to miss for many of us , the beefy heft of luger s fare , coupled with its location in williamsburg , brooklyn , casts this steakhouse as a place for dinner and nothing else but if you visit luger before 3 pm , you can indeed eat a burger here i recently visited luger around 1 pm two friends accompanied me all of us were luger lovers and none of us had ever eaten its burger , which we trusted not to be some newfangled novelty but a classic rendition we trusted right for each burger , luger simply takes between 8 and 10 ounces of freshly ground prime beef , molds it in a coffee cup , flattens the result just a bit , thrusts it into the same hightemperature broilers it uses for its incomparable porterhouses and then puts it on a capacious sesame seed bun ask for cheese and luger will give you unexciting , inconspicuous muenster no gruy re or gorgonzola here my friends and i elongated our burger anticipation by having a caesar salad , which was icy and insipid we did n't care the burgers , we felt certain , would redeem all i ordered mine mediumrare with muenster one of my friends ordered his medium without cheese the other ordered hers rare with a slab of luger s famous canadian bacon on the side none of the burgers hit their marks mine arrived medium to mediumwell the one that was supposed to be medium was much more done than that the one that was supposed to be rare verged on raw its center was scarily cold this was a clear failure of attentiveness in the kitchen , and when a burger is as round and highrising as luger s , vigilance is necessary to make sure the layers are not heated too unevenly and incorrectly it s a geometric challenge the ground beef itself was faultless luger uses a combination of the trimmings from its porterhouses and prime chuck roll , and the result has a pleasant richness and plush texture but the fate that the beef met was a careless and disappointing one , at least during our visit we sought to console ourselves with one of luger s tall , oldfashioned ice cream sundaes , slathered with the restaurant s fantastic whipped cream but is there any real consolation when an imagined hamburger heaven turns out to be a hamburger purgatory \? for me there is n't for me the frustration of a burger needlessly complicated is more than matched by the letdown of a simple burger that s simply botched peter luger , 178 broadway , williamsburg , brooklyn \( 718 \) 3877400 burger , 795 with cheese , 150 extra with french fries , 150 extra with bacon , 250 extra
last week in rye , drivers who had just parked were clearly unfamiliar with the hightech parking pay station installed over the summer several of them were seen approaching it warily with its sleek looks and large digital screen , it seemed to promise far more than the clunkysounding older mechanical parking meters that still punctuate many downtown areas but then reality set in even though this pay station could spit out detailed receipts , it could n't make change or accept anything larger than a dollar bill , which pays for a minimum of two hours this is ridiculous , snapped one woman as she walked off , a 5 bill in her hand rye officials did not return phone calls seeking comment on the limits of the new equipment which its manufacturer says can be ordered with a changemaking feature but , frustrations aside , its very presence indicates an official step toward moremodern parking technology in westchester nor is it the only evidence white plains parking officials say that in four municipal garages , they are in the process of installing 25 multispace parking stations usable with credit cards as well as coins and bills the city is even looking into testing a payment system that would let drivers call in meter payments with a cellphone , said john p larson , deputy director of the parking department mike rodgers , a marketing vice president for a canadian supplier called digital payment technologies , which built rye s system , says most municipalities these days are choosing pay stations that accept credit cards , because it is so costly to keep them filled with change but failing that solution , even the lowly parking meter , it turns out , can be retrofitted to operate with the use of a prepaid key \( if the meter is a newer electronic model , not an old mechanical one \) last fall , following the lead of white plains and tarrytown , the village of pelham upgraded 535 parking meters to accept both coins and meter keys , which drivers can buy in any amount after making a 15 deposit richard slingerland , pelham s administrator , says that although the keys were slow to catch on at first , they have become popular for use at the town s 12hour parking meters so far , he said , the village has sold 140 of them , with drivers typically buying 50 to 100 of parking time per key we used to get a lot of complaints about our meters failing to work , he added about threequarters of the time they were n't working because they were just too full with quarters that is no wonder , as experts say the average parking meter can hold only about 60 in quarters pelham s new keys have already made a 25 percent dent in the amount of change that parking officials collect from meters which are now emptied once a week instead of twice , according to mr slingerland the best part for him fewer complaints from motorists frustrated by nonworking meters but none of this is to minimize how far the county still has to go in modernizing although white plains is installing its new parking equipment , for instance , it remains encumbered by about 3 , 600 of the old mechanical singlespace meters for eight years now , mr larson says , the city has been slowly upgrading at a cost of about 170 per meter , he explained , new electronic technology is installed so far , about 2 , 400 of the new ones have been installed finally , for a really lowtech parking experience , consider the slotted parking payment walls that are still found at many metronorth train stations reminiscent of the walls of mailboxes found in the lobbies of condo complexes , they have rows of small numbered slots arranged in a grid each number corresponds to a parking place the 325 payment charged by metronorth for 16 hours \( for a full 24 , it s 475 \) must be made either by feeding in a load of quarters or by separately folding each dollar bill so it will fit through an opening an inch wide and an eighth of an inch thick directions on one side of the slot wall urge drivers to use either a key or a nearby metallic stuffer to get the money in \( at the pelham wall early last week , the stuffer had been torn off \) marjorie anders , a spokeswoman for metronorth , says that in parking lots with 50 spaces or fewer , the slot walls are more economical to use than multispace electronic pay stations a multispace meter station that accepts bills , coins and credit cards costs about 19 , 000 while a slot box is only about 1 , 500 , she said these boxes are n't attractive , but they 're low tech and they do n't need electricity yet as mr slingerland acknowledged , this primitive payment method can be a hindrance when people are rushing to take the train photos these mechanical meters in rye are still the norm in most of westchester a parking pay station , with its digital screen , in a municipal lot in rye , where it was installed over the summer \( photographs by suzy allman for the new york times \)
far hills , nj steve blum has been spending his days locked up alone in a silent warehouse in central new jersey , sorting through boxes of what looks like scrap metal but to him , the dusty shingles are buried treasure these old dies and plates were once used to print items of great worth bank notes , stock certificates and bond coupons , as well as postage stamps , tickets , playing cards and other types of paper ephemera the slabs , about an eighth of an inch thick and ranging from an inch square to postersize , lie in boxes stacked on more than a hundred pallets some of them date to the 1830 s this 200ton trove once belonged to the american bank note company , a major new york securities printer whose clients included governments , universities , banks and railroads , from captains of industry to humble savings and loans as demand for steel and copperplate engraving fell , the company merged with or acquired many of its competitors , often picking up their old plates as well you 're looking at the archive of an entire industry here , explained mr blum , 49 , a rarecoin dealer from westfield , nj , one of the two investors who bought the plates last year for a few million dollars mr blum is cataloging them in preparation for their eventual sale to the public , the first time this kind of material has left the vaults of any bank note company in significant quantities q david bowers , an authority on coins and bank notes who is preparing a history of american bank note and other bank note printers , said getting at the archives was like opening king tut s tomb there is no national archive of paper money , he said , so this also contributes a lot to historians' knowledge of the field in its heyday , mr bowers said , american bank note was like the general motors of security printing they probably had 80 percent of the business , he said the company was in the merchants' exchange on wall street each piece of metal bears a finely engraved design , cut in reverse , with every letter , line and gracefully shaded image made up of hundreds of tiny dots and dashes that once held the ink the lettering and pictures were engraved by hand the geometric patterns , by specially engineered lathes following a secret pattern this intricacy of design guarded against forgery one of the plates , used to print the admission tickets to the republican national convention of 1908 , bears a portrait of lincoln that would look at home on a 5 bill part of a 20 note issued by the lafayette national bank of new york bears an exquisite portrait of the french hero for whom the bank is named american bank note , now based near philadelphia , sold its archive of old dies and printing plates to archival collectibles llc , the company owned by mr blum and his business partner , john albanese , 46 , of far hills , whose previous ventures included marketing treasures recovered from shipwrecks the plates were loaded onto 16 tractortrailers and moved from american bank note s storage in tennessee to the new jersey warehouse there , mr blum began the painstaking process of sorting through it all none of the plates are for bank notes that are now legal tender those would not be legal for us to own , mr albanese said the same goes for us postage stamps he added , if we find anything for federal currency , we must return it the american bank notes represented in this archive are from private banks that were once authorized to print their own currency , a policy that was changed in the 1860 s such notes have value only to collectors today mr blum said that in a test sale , some smaller pieces sold for about 30 each items with historic or artistic significance , in mr bowers s opinion , could bring tens of thousands of dollars each better pieces will be donated to museums or collectors' societies , mr blum said mr albanese said they had already turned down an offer of 150 , 000 for the printing plate of a walt disney company stock certificate showing the founder and his famous mouse we plan to auction the plates , beginning in the summer of 2006 , and let the collectors decide the value , he said douglas mudd , curator of exhibitions at the american numismatic association money museum in colorado springs , said such sales could be controversial among collectors since in theory the plates could be used to reprint old notes but he said that federal law protects collectors from new reprints being sold as authentic prints and acknowledged the archive s historical value mr blum said he is awed by the plates' historical significance it was the financial power made possible by this printing that made america great
as fuel prices rise , and the tempers of american drivers with them , so , too , has the number of people who are stealing gasoline from maine to oklahoma , gas station owners are reporting a surge in the number of drivers who pull up to the pump , fill up and drive off without paying the incidents , known as drive offs which are typically concentrated at stations near big cities and interstates are forcing stations across the country to adopt prepay policies for cash customers gasoline theft cost the industry made up largely of convenience stores 237 million in 2004 , trade associations estimate , and the figure is on track to double this year , said matthew kussman , the director of business development at gaspricewatchcom , which tracks gasoline prices and is starting a national database of theft incidents there is a direct correlation between theft and prices being the highest they have ever been , mr kussman said and hurricane katrina has not helped the situation station owners report that they have sometimes faced frightening confrontations with gas thieves last month , a station owner in alabama was struck and killed after he tried to get in front of a sport utility vehicle whose driver was trying to leave without paying this is absolutely a concern , said holly tuminello , the vice president of the petroleum marketers association of america people get mad when they fill up their car and become irrational at the person selling gas at their little store store owners and convenience store managers interviewed around the country said they had gone from none to a few cases a week to several a day the thefts began to spike , the station owners say , around midsummer , when gas prices hit 250 a gallon and prices have pushed higher since then aaa reported yesterday that a gallon of regular unleaded gasoline was selling for 303 on average nationwide , down from 304 on wednesday average prices peaked at 306 on monday and spiked at 4 to 5 in some cities we are up to two or three a day , said kelly porter , a clerk at the citgo quick mart in norfolk , va they pump and make sure we are n't looking and just drive off in contrast to heavily urbanized areas on the east and west coasts where nearly all stations require prepayment by cash or credit card , many stations elsewhere in the nation allow customers to pump first because it is both convenient for drivers and more lucrative people who prepay tend to put less gas in their cars but , it allows for theft people who pump without paying can be seen in all sorts of cars from latemodel sedans to brand new suv s and include college students and even the occasional retiree , station owners said in june members of a theft ring in florida were arrested for using trucks to siphon off gallons of gas from stations wyman tapley , the owner of tapley s grill and variety in bar harbor , maine , said he was so stunned by the driveoffs that the first time it happened , he thought a customer had simply been chatting with other locals , forgot to pay and would return the next day , as happens from time to time i just did n't think this could happen this far north , mr tapley said we live on an island so it is hard to believe people think they could do that and get away with it arrests of gas thieves is rare , gas station owners and operators said in response to the wave of thefts , many individual station owners and convenience store companies who previously were more trusting are requiring customers to pay cash before they pump that represents a sea change for stations in small towns and many american cities some cities have passed laws to require prepay , and others , like new jersey , require an attendant to pump gas on wednesday , cumberland farms , a chain of convenience stores , reversed its position and decided that it would require drivers to pay before pumping in 140 of its 900 stations in the northeast and florida the stations are in places where the other competitors are all prepay , said christen graham , a spokeswoman for the company cumberland farms felt it actually became a target so they have changed the policy wawa , the pennsylvaniabased convenience store chain , said last week that its 540 stores in five states would begin to require prepayment driveoffs may create unsafe situations on store lots , and contribute to higher prices , the company said in a statement drivers who pay with credit cards at the pump 54 percent last year are not affected by prepay policies it is not too good for people who come here every day , said benny nat , whose family owns a citgo quick mart , in des moines generally , store owners selling gas are loath to require drivers to prepay drivers often underestimate how much it will cost to fill up , and buy less , said jeff lenard , the spokesman for the national association of convenience stores , in alexandria va further , prepay drivers tend to pick up fewer bags of mm s and bottles of water , and those who are required to prepay , especially in times of high prices , may opt to do so with a credit card , which raises fees and chews at the margins of the station owners most retailers do n't make their money at the pump , mr lenard said they really need customers to get in the store the quiktrip corporation , a convenience store and gas station company in tulsa , has come up with a solution that other companies will probably ape cash customers provide gas station clerks with their driver s license , who in turn give the drivers a plastic card that activates the pump , but allows them to pay after pumping if the driver does not pay the is deactivated and the license number is turned over to the police two years ago in tulsa we were losing 4 million a year in gas rips , said mike thornbrugh a spokesman for quiktrip , which operates stations in nine states and since we have instituted this , you would be lucky to see losses of a couple hundred dollars a month we love it , and law enforcement loves it , too
mexico city , dec 9 it has been a year since the brother of former president carlos salinas de gortari was found suffocated , but the state and federal authorities have yet to untangle the motives for his killing , much less arrest his killers and their accomplices the investigation has taken several surprising turns two elite federal agents have been arrested on charges of trying to extort money from the brother , enrique salinas de gortari , yet they have not been tied to his killing two other agents have gone into hiding after being named as suspects in the extortion plot mr salinas s lawyer and another close friend have been arrested investigators say they failed to mention that two days after the killing , they tried to collect 29 million that mr salinas had arranged to borrow from a friend , perhaps to pay off blackmailers mr salinas s companion has fled to the united states after learning that investigators wanted to talk to her a second time because of discrepancies in her account to top it off , the federal government has seized control of the extortion investigation from the state of mexico because it involves members of the federal investigation agency , mexico s equivalent of the fbi but so far , despite interviewing 229 witnesses and conducting more than 70 studies of forensic evidence , the mexico state prosecutor , alfonso navarrete prida , has not been able to lay his hands on mr salina s killers nor has the federal internal affairs investigator , ismael gonz lez verra , reported any progress in solving the crime the investigation appears to be stalled the salinas inquiry is fast becoming a study in how highprofile crimes often go unsolved by the law enforcement authorities in mexico , where investigative techniques are behind the times , the police are often involved in crimes , and indictments and trials are kept secret that a major case goes unsolved is not unusual here it happens so often that criminologists say most mexicans have come to expect little from the authorities our apparatus has collapsed in terms of credibility , said ernesto l pez portillo of the institute for security and democracy in mexico city , which studies criminal justice issues when investigations get bogged down , the society simply has no way to understand what s happening the institutions react to the scandal , and as time goes on , interest wanes and there is no public accounting this case is no different carlos salinas led mexico from 1988 to 1994 and remains a power broker in the institutional revolutionary party , the authoritarian and corrupt machine that ran mexico for 70 years before being defeated in the 2000 elections he is widely reviled for the economic collapse he set in motion at the end of his term enrique salinas , an engineer who never entered politics but became wealthy during his brother s term , was found dead on dec 6 of last year , inside a car he had borrowed from his companion , hilda deneken , state investigators say he had been beaten and had a plastic bag over his head the cause of death was asphyxiation he was 52 a security camera in the upperclass suburban mexico city neighborhood where his body was found recorded an armored black jeep cherokee leaving the scene with at least two people inside the camera did not record the plate number , nor were the people recognizable at the time , the french police were looking for mr salinas to question him about several questionable financial transactions between him and another brother , ra l , in the 1990 s , in which large amounts of money were laundered through real estate deals ra l salinas still faces charges here stemming from the discovery of millions of unexplained dollars found in his swiss bank accounts relying on testimony from mr salinas s adult children and other family members , mr navarrete , the state prosecutor , has charged that federal agents were trying to use the interpol request from france to extort 29 million from mr salinas he said he believed that one of the extortionists had roughed up mr salinas to scare him and that he died during the torture the two federal agents in custody photographed mr salinas s house , visited him and called him on the telephone , state investigators say family members told state investigators that the federal agents had demanded money after the killing federal agents , tipped off by the local police , got to the crime scene before the state police , ostensibly to confirm the victim s identity later that day , a federal agent sent a document to interpol saying mr salinas was not in mexico , which was true only in a spiritual sense , state investigators said still , mr navarrete has never been able to tie the two federal agents he has in jail to the killing itself , and now he says the inquiry has been taken out of his hands by the federal internal affairs prosecutor he maintains that the two higherranking agents who are on the run eleazar rub n mu oz valdez and nah m garc a ortiz can identify the killers so , too , he says , can ms deneken , who is believed to be in the united states all three knew whom mr salinas went to meet the night of his death , mr navarrete said all of them are key pieces to find out the intellectual authors of the extortion against enrique salinas and , with that , to be able to identify the killers , he said recently a spokesman for the federal attorney general s office , jos luis manjarrez , said he could not comment on the internal affairs investigation there are other intriguing pieces to the puzzle eight months before he died , mr salinas bought a life insurance policy that would pay his three children from a previous marriage 4 million if he were to die during a kidnapping or extortion attempt , investigators say and a week before the killing , a news magazine published details of mr salinas s personal fortune , showing he was a multimillionaire as late as 1998 , when he divorced adriana lagarde , the mother of his children three days before his death , mr salinas visited a businessman in monterrey , mexico , and reached an agreement to borrow 29 million a close friend , jos ricardo hern ndez , and his lawyer , mariano de jes s flores , accompanied him on the trip , investigators say two days after the killing , the friend and the lawyer returned to monterrey and tried unsuccessfully to collect the money from the businessman , investigators say the lawyer s cellphone records show numerous calls to the federal investigation agency in the days leading up to the killing , they say the day before his death , mr salinas told ms deneken that he had to go to a meeting that afternoon , state investigators say he also asked to borrow her car , her telephone and some blue clothing , they say , but ms deneken mentioned none of that to investigators according to witnesses , ms deneken then accompanied mr salinas as he left through a rear alleyway , apparently to avoid detection , then slipped out onto the street where her car was parked , investigators say she gave him the keys and her telephone he drove away at 1 pm he was found dead the next morning an unsigned note on his body said that someone had been harassing him since 1995 and that his children have had to confront great risk to their security , both physical and emotional

on the first floor of a nondescript upper east side town house one afternoon this month , an art dealer named mark borghi showed a visitor five small paintencrusted boards that he handled as gingerly as if they were faberg eggs filled with nitroglycerine in the art world , they may indeed be almost that explosive mr borghi , a longtime dealer in modern paintings who has been burned in the past buying works that turned out to be clever fakes , said he was convinced that the abstract expressionist paintings in front of him were the real thing , and the discovery of a lifetime for any dealer previously unknown early jackson pollock drip paintings , part of a trove of 32 paintings by the artist on boards and paper found two years ago in a metal storage bin in wainscott , ny unlike many recent supposed pollock discoveries that have made the news one supposedly bearing the artist s fingerprint , bought at a california thrift store for 5 another said to have come from one of pollock s high school teachers the works sitting that day in mr borghi s gallery had a provenance that was particularly convincing they were found in 2003 by alex matter , the son of the graphic artist and photographer herbert matter and the painter mercedes matter , who were good friends of pollock and his wife , the artist lee krasner the paintings , wrapped in brown paper and tied with string , were included with other artworks and letters that the elder mr matter had left with other personal effects after his death in 1984 according to alex matter , a filmmaker who remembers pollock well from his childhood , his father s handwriting on the paper clearly labeled the works as being pollocks painted in the late 1940 s , paintings his father either bought or had been given by the artist and in bh friedman s 1972 biography of pollock , mr matter had indeed talked of buying small works from pollock in the late 1940 s but in the two weeks since the news of the works' existence delivered with the help of a web site and a flurry of press releases an intense and at times personal battle over who really painted them has been shaping up within a small , once unified group of the world s leading pollock experts the case evoking the inevitable images of the cedar bar and the heyday of the new york school has cast a new spotlight on the contentious field of art authentication , in which paper trails can remain shadowy , doubts can linger for decades and even experts sure of their findings are often afraid to speak because of the threat of lawsuits within this world , the work of authenticating pollocks has been particularly divisive this is partly because of the sheer quantity of paintings that have surfaced since the artist died in 1956 forgers apparently feel that faking his frenetic drips is easier than , say , faking a raphael and because of the sevenfigure prices that real pollocks command , fights over authenticity nearly always end up in the courts and in the news \( some experts have speculated that if real , the newly discovered works could collectively fetch as much as 10 million \) on one side of the new dispute is ellen g landau , the author of a wellregarded 1989 pollock biography , who says she firmly believes that the works are real and has agreed to work with mr borghi and mr matter to create an exhibition of the paintings to open next year , the 50th anniversary of pollock s death but since the works and dr landau s role in supporting them were announced , the pollockkrasner foundation , which has declined to be involved in authentication cases for almost a decade , has entered the fray what we 're talking about now is newly discovered works of a magnitude that is unprecedented in terms of numbers , said ronald d spencer , a lawyer for the foundation , which was created by lee krasner it requires the foundation to rethink its involvement in pollock authorship questions toward that end , it is now enlisting its own group of experts , including eugene v thaw , a veteran art dealer who , along with francis v o'connor , wrote the fourvolume catalogue raisonn , or complete listing , of pollock s work , regarded as the definitive word on authenticity in a recent phone interview , mr thaw said that based on his viewing of seven of the paintings earlier this year mr borghi flew with them to mr thaw s home in santa fe , nm he strongly disagrees with dr landau and though he stressed that he was wary of being sued , he left no doubt about his views i 've spent nearly half my life working on pollocks , and if ellen landau s opinion prevails , people will happily buy them and they 'll go into museums and books , he said , but not the ones that i have anything to do with \( mr thaw also accuses mr borghi of misrepresenting him by telling people that mr thaw deemed the paintings authentic mr borghi denies doing so \) the public disagreement between dr landau and mr thaw is more surprising because these two experts along with mr o'connor and another leading pollock scholar , william lieberman worked as a team for several years on the pollockkrasner authentication board , established by the foundation to examine and rule \( for no charge \) on disputed works the board was frequently sued by wouldbe pollock owners , whose cases sometimes verged on the ridiculous \( in one , court records show that a man added a signature to the back of a drip painting but spelled it pollack when the board declared the painting fake he sued , and lost \) the board disbanded in 1996 for reasons that remain unclear , and afterward its members declined to become involved individually in authentication , though dr landau , a professor at case western reserve university in cleveland , said she still receives many email messages from people claiming to have found a pollock my stock response is that 'i'm sorry i do n't do private authentication , and i do n't open email attachments i'm not expecting , ' she said in a recent phone interview but when mr borghi contacted her in the late summer of 2004 and wanted to show her drip paintings he said were owned by herbert matter , she said she felt compelled to give them a look my interest was piqued because all my research told me that they had been very good friends , she said , adding i must admit that i kind of broke my rule , so to say and when she later saw the works during a trip to new york , she felt her decision was justified i was completely blown away , she said , calling them the scholarly thrill of a lifetime dr landau said that beyond mr matter s connection , several factors led her to believe the works were authentic many are painted on artists' drawing boards that are blue on one side herbert matter used this type of board and would have had it in his studio in tudor city in manhattan , where pollock is thought to have worked occasionally dr landau said she found the same kinds of boards in pollock s studio in springs on long island of the paintings themselves , she said it s his kind of gesture and his kind of marking she added that at least one painting incorporates the initials j and p , as pollock did in other work there are too many things about them that are pure jackson but mr thaw argues that the boards work against a pollock attribution none of his other works were painted on such boards , he said , and he found it unlikely that pollock would have borrowed matter s material it s an explanation , but i do n't think it s a plausible explanation , he said , adding that his examination of the seven paintings and of photographs of the rest convinced him that they were not all done by the same person there are several different handwritings in that batch , he said , referring to the whorls , loops and splatters of paint mr thaw s disagreement with ms landau sometimes seems a bit personal as well , strengthened by his anger that she did not contact him or other former members of the authentication board when she became aware of the works i think it s sort of unnatural , unseemly , said mr thaw , who added later in the conversation we should have been included in it from the start we certainly would have made some effort at that time if ellen landau had brought this particularly sensational discovery to our attention but mr matter said he did try early on to enlist mr thaw and the foundation in the authentication process through a veteran dealer with ties to both , joan washburn , who represents part of the pollock estate those efforts went nowhere , he said , so he turned to mr borghi , whom he had earlier selected to represent his mother s estate i needed advice , pure and simple , he said two months before the announcement was made , dr landau and mr borghi also visited the foundation in new york , but officials there only reminded them that the group was no longer involved in authentication of course , a big question inevitably raised in the case is who stands to profit \? mr matter says he has no immediate plans to sell the works and instead intends to give some to institutions and to keep the rest basically , i never say never , but if you had to ask me right now i would n't , he said he also said that he had made no promises to mr borghi about the dealer having any stake if there were a sale dr landau said she is being paid she declines to say how much to organize the show , but she stressed that her motivation was academic i have never been paid by either the estate or the gallery to authenticate the works , she said by email nor have i been promised any stake in future sales \( should there be any \) , or promised any works in return for my arthistorical expertise my fee solely covers the curatorial work and essays i will submit and while she is reluctant to spar publicly with mr thaw , who once gave a party at the metropolitan museum of art to celebrate one of her books , she raised clear questions about his motivations and those of mr o'connor , who have both bought and sold pollock works one of the advantages i bring to the project is my objectivity , she wrote unlike the authors of the pollock catalogue raisonn , i have never been involved in buying or selling works by pollock i am an art historian with an impeccable reputation , not an art dealer \( through the foundation , mr o'connor declined to comment for this article the foundation also said that mr lieberman , who is in bad health , would not be available to comment \) an even bigger question that remains as the case plays out it if they 're not pollocks , who did paint them \? mr thaw has theories anyone mercedes herself or her students or a combination of both could have tried to do pollock imitations on cardboard , he said but mr matter finds that suggestion ludicrous he has no idea who my mother is as a painter , as an artist , he said she would rather kill herself than try and copy somebody else s work it s beyond even comprehension mr thaw said he also found it hard to believe that mercedes matter , who died in 2001 , would not have known about the paintings but mr matter said that his parents sometimes quarreled over selling works he said that they almost divorced after she sold a treasured giacometti statue and that he might well have hidden the works from her he knew that she might sell something at any moment , he said are they really pollocks \? in the end , unfortunately , even after the foundation renders its opinion and the works go on view for a curious public , the answer may end up being no more than a definite maybe leaving them in a limbo that perhaps only disputed works by andy warhol and salvador dal can rival in modern art mr borghi said that such a fate would be the art world s loss in the academic world , scholars can disagree , he said , but this seems meanspirited to me mr thaw says he fully believes he is right , but he sounds at times as if he hopes that he is proven wrong nobody wants to prevent these paintings from being seen , he said put them up , let them be seen , let them be examined there s nothing i would like more , he said , than to find more pollocks
as far as apologies go , the one offered by jeremy rose shortly after crossing the finish line seven lengths ahead of his nearest challenger in the 137th running of the belmont stakes was among the strangest neither afleet alex nor his rider , rose , was breathing hard despite swooshing around the far turn and rolling down the stretch as if he were riding a jet stream he should be a triple crown winner , but i messed up or whatever , rose said it was a startling and somewhat puzzling proclamation by rose , who could not get the bad taste of a thirdplace finish in the kentucky derby on may 7 out of his mouth he and afleet alex had enthralled the nation three weeks ago in the second leg of the triple crown when they turned a bad stumble at the top of the stretch at pimlico race course into a gravitydefying recovery and a runaway victory at belmont park yesterday , 62 , 274 fans marveled as afleet alex slingshotted around seven horses on the final turn and made the belmont s grueling mileandahalf distance seem puny but rose made it clear that he did not agree with meat loaf , who once sang soulfully , two out of three ai n't bad i knew i had the fastest quartermile when i needed it , he said of his patience here yesterday and the record book proved he was correct afleet alex came home faster than any belmont winner since arts and letters in 1969 , in 242 5 seconds , and in the process became the 11th horse to win the preakness and belmont stakes after losing the kentucky derby he finished in a modest 2 2875 the only thing that could get him beat was me , so i stayed out of his way , rose said rose and afleet alex stayed out of the way of his 10 challengers for all but the most important part of a race that has earned the title test of the champion they loped along in eighth place for a mile as the nick zitotrained pinpoint and as the d wayne lukasconditioned ap arrow set a tepid pace in the hopes they could steal off with the race uncharacteristically , it was the derby winner , giacomo , who took up the chase first at churchill downs , mike smith waited patiently in 18th place aboard the gray giacomo and let a wickedly fast pace wobble the legs of those ahead of him yesterday , smith and giacomo ran in tandem with jockey jon court and southern africa around the far turn to run down pinpoint and get a jump on the stretch smith was not changing tactics he was trying to salvage a good performance from his ailing colt before the race , giacomo flipped his palate , a condition that obstructs the airways you could hear it he made a roaring sound , smith said i heard it into the gate and it got louder during the race afleet alex was scooting down the middle of the track , inhaling challengers and squaring his shoulders for an explosive final sprint he passed giacomo and southern africa , as did the distant secondplace finisher andromeda s hero and nolan s cat , who was third it really was an uneventful race , rose said the stopwatch and tote board bore him out afleet alex , a son of northern afleet out of the mare maggy hawk , was the heavy favorite and paid his backers 430 for a 2 bet to win his final time was not particularly eyeopening the same could be said about this season for 3yearolds after three straight years of horses pulling into belmont park with a chance at the triple crown , there was a pall cast over the final leg of one of the most difficult feats in sports the crowd was docile yesterday , and smaller than the more than 73 , 000 who came to watch the preakness champion point given contest a rubber match with the derby winner monarchos in 2001 the belmont stakes also emphatically doused what could have been an amazing spring for zito heading into the derby , he had won nearly every major 3yearold prep race his fivehorse entry at churchill downs made racing history , but none hit the board zito ran three more back in the preakness , but could do no better than a fourth yesterday , at least , andromeda s hero one of his three starters gave the new yorkbased zito his sixth secondplace finish in his hometown s most famous race to go along with one victory \( last year with birdstone \) but an 0for11 record in the spring classics was not what zito was after rose , too , could only find disappointment at the end of the trail he had ridden afleet alex in 11 of his 12 starts , including all 8 of his victories his colt was surrounded with pathos and subplots afleet alex s breeder , john silvertand , who has outlived his cancer prognosis alex scott , the girl who died last august at age 8 but not before turning a lemonade stand into a foundation that raises money to battle juvenile cancer and tim ritchey , the trainer of afleet alex , who chose an unorthodox training path of training his colt twice a day for up to five miles of work but rose understood that none of it equaled sweeping a triple crown he and afleet alex were beaten by a length in the derby even though they had the lead with 60 or so yards to go no one has really accused rose of getting his colt beat , but somehow he seems to sense it may be true you ca n't blame tim , and you ca n't blame afleet alex , he said so if you have to blame someone , blame me i do n't want to hear any more criticism about my horse knock me , but do n't knock him he s one of the best we 'll see in a long time
what was most unusual about eva yerbabuena s program on sunday night at the new york flamenco festival at city center was how she made real choreographic use of flamenco vocabulary but it would n't have mattered much if she herself had n't danced so well unlike the program on thursday and friday , when traditional flamenco was confined by a conceptual framework , and unlike the saturday program by ballet flamenco eva yerbabuena , which was billed as traditional flamenco , the sunday program offered real choreography using flamenco idioms the title , 5 mujeres 5 , translates as 5 women 5 in this 75minute uninterrupted piece , ms yerbabuena purports to show us different states , or archetypes , of the female experience solitude , love , ambition , madness and , it would seem , proud triumph at the end essentially it s a long solo for ms yerbabuena , but it comes freighted with an apparatus that might seem , in a mere description , to be impossibly hokey \( actually , a couple of applausemilking moments , when light was suddenly blasted down on ms yerbabuena , and some strobelike flickering lights during some of the scene changes , were pretty hokey \) there were eight other dancers \( four men and four women \) and seven musicians six musicians , led by paco jarana , were at the back of the stage , fading in and out of view in ra l perotti s evocative lighting the seventh , a good soprano named marta de castro , wandered about the stage singing a cappella , a kind of alter ego for ms yerbabuena there was also a white armchair , in which the star sat at the beginning and end , musing the other dancers were in white \( with some metallic gray accents \) , lighted starkly from above ms yerbabuena and javier latorre , who was credited as guest choreographer , and hansel cereza , who was credited as a director had them strike totemic poses in ritual patterns , sometimes echoing her , sometimes confronting her , rarely comforting her this was choreography that made use of flamenco in the same way ballet choreographers use classic ballet steps all of which provided ms yerbabuena with a framework for a series of solos and adequate rest between them the solos covered the gamut of flamenco styles at the end , though the dramatic import of this was unclear , ms yerbabuena changed costumes , from white to black none of this would have made much of an impact had ms yerbabuena s two big solos , one in white and the other in black , not been so fine the haughty flamenco attitude , the backwardtilted torso , the sinuous hands and arms , the rapid patter of footwork interlocking with percussion and hand claps , rightly elicited fervent cries of enthusiasm from the audience
today the senate is expected to vote to limit debate on a bill that toughens the existing bankruptcy law , probably ensuring the bill s passage a solid bloc of republican senators , assisted by some democrats , has already voted down a series of amendments that would either have closed loopholes for the rich or provided protection for some poor and middleclass families the bankruptcy bill was written by and for credit card companies , and the industry s political muscle is the reason it seems unstoppable but the bill also fits into the broader context of what jacob hacker , a political scientist at yale , calls risk privatization a steady erosion of the protection the government provides against personal misfortune , even as ordinary families face evergrowing economic insecurity the bill would make it much harder for families in distress to write off their debts and make a fresh start instead , many debtors would find themselves on an endless treadmill of payments the credit card companies say this is needed because people have been abusing the bankruptcy law , borrowing irresponsibly and walking away from debts the facts say otherwise a vast majority of personal bankruptcies in the united states are the result of severe misfortune one recent study found that more than half of bankruptcies are the result of medical emergencies the rest are overwhelmingly the result either of job loss or of divorce to the extent that there is significant abuse of the system , it s concentrated among the wealthy including corporate executives found guilty of misleading investors who can exploit loopholes in the law to protect their wealth , no matter how illgotten one increasingly popular loophole is the creation of an asset protection trust , which is worth doing only for the wealthy senator charles schumer introduced an amendment that would have limited the exemption on such trusts , but apparently it s ok to game the system if you 're rich 54 republicans and 2 democrats voted against the schumer amendment other amendments were aimed at protecting families and individuals who have clearly been forced into bankruptcy by events , or who would face extreme hardship in repaying debts ted kennedy introduced an exemption for cases of medical bankruptcy russ feingold introduced an amendment protecting the homes of the elderly dick durbin asked for protection for armed services members and veterans all were rejected none of this should come as a surprise it s all part of the pattern as mr hacker and others have documented , over the past three decades the lives of ordinary americans have become steadily less secure , and their chances of plunging from the middle class into acute poverty ever larger job stability has declined spells of unemployment , when they happen , last longer fewer workers receive health insurance from their employers fewer workers have guaranteed pensions some of these changes are the result of a changing economy but the underlying economic trends have been reinforced by an ideologically driven effort to strip away the protections the government used to provide for example , longterm unemployment has become much more common , but unemployment benefits expire sooner health insurance coverage is declining , but new initiatives like health savings accounts \( introduced in the 2003 medicare bill \) , rather than discouraging that trend , further undermine the incentives of employers to provide coverage above all , of course , at a time when everfewer workers can count on pensions from their employers , the current administration wants to phase out social security the bankruptcy bill fits right into this picture when everything else goes wrong , americans can still get a measure of relief by filing for bankruptcy and rising insecurity means that they are forced to do this more often than in the past but congress is now poised to make the bankruptcy law harsher , too warren buffett recently made headlines by saying america is more likely to turn into a sharecroppers' society than an ownership society but i think the right term is a debt peonage society after the system , prevalent in the postcivil war south , in which debtors were forced to work for their creditors the bankruptcy bill wo n't get us back to those bad old days all by itself , but it s a significant step in that direction and any senator who votes for the bill should be ashamed oped columnist email krugman nytimescom
fort dix , nj , dec 22 as a convoy of humvees crawled down a sandy , bumpy road , a bomb exploded inside one vehicle , the gunner collapsed we have a casualty down and wounded , a sergeant yelled into his radio handset we need a medical evac and helicopter specialist jeffery kavanaugh , 21 , the gunner , lay motionless , still breathing but gurgling the driver tossed him a bandage no one else in the vehicle moved to help later , recalling those moments , specialist kavanaugh said he wondered what would have happened if this were iraq , not a training exercise in the pine forests of new jersey if i was really hurt , would they let me just die there \? he said the bush administration has announced troop reductions , and some politicians in washington are debating whether the united states should pull out altogether but none of that matters to the men of the 654th military police company , a newly formed unit of the virginia army national guard their reality is that american soldiers are still needed to patrol the streets of iraq , and within a few weeks this patchwork company will be doing just that if there has been ups and downs in the news about the war , we have n't noticed , said capt lowell nevill , the 654th s commander we 're in another world here for two months , the group of 157 veterans and rookies has lived on tiger base , a 30acre recreation of iraq at fort dix , one of two bases in the united states that offers an immersion course for new security forces , said lt col norberto cintron , who is in charge of the training they awaken before 5 am and hear muslim prayer calls five times a day they eat flavorless food , use portable toilets and sleep on cots , 12 to a tent in military exercises , simulated grenades and improvised explosive devices , or ied s , explode , and soldiers like specialist kavanaugh dramatize severe or fatal wounds despite the emphasis on physical preparation , the trainers and soldiers at fort dix say the most important skills they will learn here are loyalty and teamwork , which will help them survive a year at war none of us thought we were going to be able to come together and do this , said pfc michael goodrich , 19 , who had straight a s in high school and gave up college basketball scholarships to join the national guard last year after awhile , we pretty much gave up complaining , because we realized we were stuck with each other for a year it s just like working together on a basketball team but being on a basketball team wo n't get you killed going to iraq just might the 654th arrived here in early november , a mixture of men whites , blacks , asians and hispanics from different economic backgrounds plucked from more than 10 national guard units from virginia and pieced together to form a unit big enough to serve as a military police company in iraq like a weekend softball team , these men represented a range of ages \( 19 to 50 \) , athleticism \( college athletes to couch potatoes \) and professional backgrounds \( including policemen , a cook and a dog trainer \) most came from field artillery units some , slightly less than 10 percent , had served in iraq and volunteered to return captain nevill , 33 , who has a bachelor s degree in cultural anthropology from the university of virginia , is in charge of this unit at home , he is a patrolman for the manassas police department here , he is responsible for these men in the shared misery of tiger base , captain nevill said , he saw his soldiers transformed from individuals to a cohesive unit , especially after a grueling transition to military life limited sleep and no days off many of his men contracted nagging coughs or upper respiratory infections , particularly when temperatures dipped into single digits and the tent heaters stopped working we 're not running or lifting weights , but we 're athletes of another kind , captain nevill said , wearing his required helmet and bulletproof vest it s endurance and toughness it takes the body a long time to get used to that although the gym often goes unused , soldiers work out during drills more mental than physical the training for the guard has evolved units deployed early in the war sometimes received a week or two of training now , the training for security forces at specialized sites like fort dix lasts at least two months and includes more complex simulations but the 654th will not know how prepared it is until it comes under live fire what s going to take them to get with the program is a bullet whizzing by their head or an ied blowing up next to them , said sgt first class donald wilson , a trainer here who likened this work to his days as an adult league basketball coach only then , sergeant wilson said , will they find out how good a team they 've become every day , convoys from the 654th roll through a makeshift iraqi city with hidden threats when the men see the sign the city of balad welcomes you , gunners grasp their m249 s and 50caliber machine guns the convoys pass a blue mosque and aluminum shipping containers made to look like buildings , each spraypainted with arabic or english phrases like go home usa sometimes snipers shoot blanks at the humvees , inciting a simulated firefight civilians , including iraqis living in the united states , occasionally linger in the streets like movie extras some are instructed to look friendly and wave , others to grimace and yell in arabic soldiers must react to cues purple smoke means a rocketpropelled grenade has hit , white means a roadside bomb and when a trainer hands a soldier like specialist kavanaugh a pocketsize card describing an injury or death , he must act the part the first time pvt christian chandler , 20 , traveled through fort dix s balad , he was a nervous wreck hoping to become a cosmetologist or a massage therapist , he joined the guard to earn extra money and then trained to be an administrative specialist now he is a gunner , which he said , surprised and shocked and scared me because gunners are vulnerable private chandler said he felt sick when he saw the arabic words for stop or i will shoot written phonetically on the windshield of his vehicle so he could memorize them he was so skittish , he once lost control of a humvee and plowed into a tree his team leader , sgt jamie padgett , said private chandler was initially unwilling to pop out of the gunner s hatch we had to pretty much push him up there , he said as weeks went on , private chandler convinced himself he could be a worthy gunner because he was athletic he played high school basketball in smithville , va , though as a senior his team lost every game in the final weeks here , he began wearing a black ski mask , revealing only his eyes , to keep warm and to look menacing one day , he picked up his machine gun and growled do i look mean now \? he said , before laughing going back to look for revenge not everyone in the 654th is a rookie about a dozen have served in iraq in the same tightly knit engineering unit they returned from a yearlong deployment in march after losing two men on dec 21 , 2004 , when a suicide bomber blew himself up in a dining hall in mosul the returning soldiers volunteered for this mission out of loyalty to their buddies sgt jon faulkner was friends with those soldiers , both 20 , and took it hard when they died he said all he could think about was returning to iraq , where he could help protect less experienced men in his new unit he keeps rereading a poem another soldier sent in an email message to him , including these lines this is the life i have to live this is the soul to the devil i give you have your parties and drink your beer while young men are dying over here i'm here kind of for revenge , said sergeant faulkner , a 21yearold archaeology student i 'll keep going to iraq until the war is over sergeant faulkner , from fredericksburg , va , said that as a boy he was the target of bullies but that he grew into an aggressive young man he played on two state championship soccer teams in high school , then joined the national guard because , he said , i love getting shot at and i love shooting back he is serious about his work , always giving orders , hardly smiling his commanders say he is a good soldier still , his colleagues shy away from asking him about iraq because they are afraid to upset him when his fellow soldiers said goodbye to their families in october , sergeant faulkner said , he wanted the emotional moments to end let s get boots on the ground , faulkner recalled thinking , so we can kill something 'we 're basically dinosaurs' specialist david newton worried about the na ve , overzealous and hardheaded young soldiers both rookies and veterans he saw when he arrived at fort dix these guys will need me as a medic , said specialist newton , 40 , a cook and college student from chesterfield , va , who reenlisted in the national guard in 2004 after a 10year break before i left , i made a promise to some of these young guys' wives that i 'd bring their husbands home in one piece well , maybe not in one piece , but they 'll come home specialist newton and guardsmen like him , many with activeduty experience , weather jokes about being old enough to have had moses as a bootcamp instructor and about their lack of technological expertise but they have developed a paternal bond with the rookies staff sgt lee stanford , 50 , a former marine corps chief warrant officer nicknamed old school , said , it takes all types to make a good squad not everybody has to be 19 and in perfect shape to be a good team player his job , he said , was to bring his 12man squad home sgt ernest grigsby , 39 , who is unmarried and has no children , is out of shape but said he had nothing to lose by going to iraq so some 20yearold would n't have to die or lose his legs while keeping a humvee warm for officers during a sevenhour training exercise one night at fire base falluja , specialist newton said , we 're basically dinosaurs here , but i really do believe they need us for our experience and patience outside , the wind and freezing temperatures cut through the soldiers' goretex jackets , reddened their faces and numbed their hands the gunners aimed for popup targets glowing in the dark the barrage of gunfire echoed as tracer rounds zoomed like red lasers trainers were also simulating an attack on the base , detonating fake mortars every few minutes , causing blinding flashes and deafening blasts i'm not going to lie to you , 90 percent of us are apprehensive about going to iraq , specialist newton said as another mortar hit we 'd be crazy if we were n't to relieve stress , he smokes two packs of cigarettes daily , cracks jokes and serenades his buddies with songs from elvis presley films like harum scarum and kissin' cousins but at night in his bunk , he becomes solemn every day i think about the chances of these kids dying there , specialist newton said it s my burden in the end , i 'll watch their back , and i hope they 'll watch mine anxious , but ready the 654th completed its final test this week on one day , the men reacted to six car bombs , two incoming mortars , two roadside bombs , one rocketpropelled grenade and several handthrown grenades , resulting in a total of seven casualties after one of those exercises , one of the trainers , sgt first class tony paden , told them , you guys stay tight , stay a good team , because you 're going to need each other to stay alive over there the soldiers stood in the biting wind , faces drawn , camouflage uniforms dirty , knowing those words were true by this time , they also knew what to expect death or injuries , maybe lost limbs their wives or girlfriends could leave them they could welcome newborns , not by touch but by email you can see it in their eyes that they are scared , said sergeant wilson , the trainer but it s good to be scared nothing brings a group of guys closer than sharing the same fear the men were given nine days' leave to spend the holidays with their families private chandler , the reluctant gunner , planned to take his girlfriend to dinner at an applebee s specialist newton , the veteran , wanted to embrace his wife sergeant faulkner , the serious soldier , hated the thought of wasting time private goodrich , the basketball player who had three friends die in iraq , left early to marry jacqueline mccown in richmond on christmas eve early next month , each soldier in the 654th will return alone to fort dix and begin packing for iraq soon after , they will board a flight together , their world now shrunk to a team of 157 men about the series this article is the last in a series about the role sports play in the lives of american soldiers deployed to iraq and of their families
richmond hill , ontario the euser family has something in their backyard , sitting on the patio out by the tarpcovered swimming pool , that a wounded city 350 miles away has been waiting a long time to see it is the first fullscale , threedimensional intimation of what the world trade center memorial will look like and sound like and feel like a 27foothigh mockup of the water walls that will ring the enormous voids marking the twin towers' absence here , a snaredrum staccato already sounds as billowing silvery curtains of falling water meet in a giant l , fracturing sunlight into countless pinpoints and sending ceaseless , restless shadows racing across low parapets where , in the finished memorial , the names of the dead will be inscribed dan euser of dan euser waterarchitecture inc , a consultant to the memorial designers , built the 175 , 000 mockup in the yard behind his home and workshop in this town just north of toronto the temporary structure , made of 300 plywood sheets , timber framing , steelplate bracing and three 10horsepower pumps , simulates a 40foot corner section of one of the memorial voids this is our machine to solve problems , said douglas ross findlay of peter walker partners , the landscape architects involved in the memorial the actual waterfalls will extend almost 200 feet along each side of the two square voids , a total length of nearly 1 , 600 feet , roughly the distance from herald square to 42nd street i do n't know of any bigger one except for hydro dams , said mr euser , 51 , who collaborated with the landscape architect dan kiley on a 660footlong fountain outside the milwaukee art museum since january , mr euser has been working in increments of inches and degrees and gallons , searching for the ideal angle , distribution , speed and volume of water flow the goal is to create a veil that will not splash visitors or disintegrate in the wind or roar deafeningly or freeze in winter or clog up in autumn when the oak leaves begin falling in the surrounding plaza although elements of the trade center redevelopment plan are in flux , most notably the design of the freedom tower , the lower manhattan development corporation said the broad concept of the memorial , known as reflecting absence , is not one of them so testing continues in the euser family s backyard and gov george e pataki , in a speech today , may cite the mockup as evidence of progress at ground zero last month , key members of the memorial team called on mr euser to inspect the work in progress michael arad of handel architects j max bond jr of the architectural firm davis brody bond mr findlay anne papageorge , the memorial design director for the development corporation and kevin m rampe , the corporation president a reporter and photographer accompanied them it s a magical moment to see it realized , mr arad said the way the water is behaving is incredible it makes it feel somehow more real , as if you 're moving forward perhaps the most striking thing when the mockup came into view , nestled incongruously in a suburban setting , was that the water walls were not the thin sheets described by the design jury that chose reflecting absence last year rather , they were more like beaded curtains , with a striation that called to mind the vertical bands of the twin tower facades , dissolving in a cascade of tears the effect is achieved by pumping the water over small dams known as weirs these have serrated edges that act like fingers , spaced one and a half inches apart , separating the flow into discrete channels it s an incredibly graceful and delicate way to do it on an enormous scale , mr findlay said far more water at far greater force would be needed to create cohesive sheets , mr euser said , and these would break up anyway as they were scooped like sails by the wind , long before they reached the pools the decision to use weirs resulted directly from testing on the mockup the designers had also considered jets of water propelled through nozzles , but they froze in winter mr euser then experimented with the size , shape and spacing of the weirs , working in wood he found it was important to keep the top of the fingers moist , to prevent the accumulation of falling leaves he settled on a tapered , halfround form the angle of the flow is also critical , to prevent splashing into the openair galleries behind the water walls mr arad expressed pleasure when he saw the current solution , inclining the weirs by approximately 45 degrees it s perfect , the arc right now , he told mr euser mr bond was pleased to see that the arc kept the structural walls behind the fountain remarkably dry in the mockup , these are plywood , painted dark gray to heighten contrast and make the water more visible in the finished memorial , the walls will be granite or concrete their appearance could vary considerably if too much water hit them among the questions that have yet to be resolved is how the edge of the voids will be treated at the plaza level there may , for instance , be fivefootwide pools ringing the perimeter of each void or the precipice may occur only inches from where visitors stand perhaps the greatest remaining technical challenge is how to soften the sound mr euser is testing louvers that would sit in the pool below , perhaps in a trough of their own the idea is to create an angled surface for the water to strike , reducing the noise made by perpendicular impact , but keeping the baffle itself out of view below the surface a mockup is vital , mr findlay said , because water cannot be scaled that is , its performance in real life cannot be extrapolated from a smallscale model it has to be done full size , he said and the mockup is teaching the architects the limits of their control water behaves in its own way , mr arad said you can tweak its environment but at the end of the day , you ca n't change its behavior
washington , dec 18 the announcement by two senators last week that they would return 217 , 000 in contributions linked to the indicted lobbyist jack abramoff has produced calls for other members of congress , republicans and democrats , to follow suit or risk being tainted by the money in next year s elections mr abramoff , a major republican party fundraiser who is the focus of a federal corruption investigation in washington involving gifts to lawmakers , was long among the most generous lobbyists in the capital in directing political contributions to lawmakers who could help his clients the money , most of it from mr abramoff s indian tribe clients and their lucrative casino operations , was eagerly accepted by members of congress until this year but no more political strategists working for likely challengers in several 2006 congressional races have said they intend to publicize the donations , arguing for the ouster of incumbents tied to mr abramoff and his clients in announcing last week that they would return money from mr abramoff s clients and his lobbying partners , senators conrad burns , republican of montana , and byron l dorgan , democrat of north dakota , made clear that they were trying to distance themselves from accusations that they had done favors for mr abramoff in exchange for the donations mr burns , who is facing a difficult reelection fight next year in part because of news coverage back home about his links to mr abramoff , called for other lawmakers to return donations from the lobbyist , who is also under indictment in florida on unrelated fraud charges this is an important step that all public officials should take in order to renew the faith of voters , he said senator dorgan , the ranking democrat on the senate indian affairs committee , said he was returning 67 , 000 i think a lot of voters are beginning to recognize the name jack abramoff , said harry mitchell , chairman of the arizona democratic party mr mitchell said in an interview that the disclosures had given the party a clear opportunity to unseat at least one of the state s republican house members , representative j d hayworth of scottsdale according to the center for responsive politics , a research group in washington that monitors the influence of money in politics , mr hayworth was the largest single congressional recipient of donations from mr abramoff and his family , his associates , his indian tribe clients and a gambling cruise ship line that he owned , with more than 101 , 000 going to mr hayworth and his political action committee since 1999 mr hayworth was also a frequent guest in sports skyboxes controlled by mr abramoff and his clients , and at signatures , a washington restaurant owned by the lobbyist mr mitchell said mr hayworth needed to return donations linked to mr abramoff if he wanted to prove that he was not involved in all the corruption that s been going on in washington in the meantime , mr mitchell said , the party was looking for a strong candidate to challenge mr hayworth in a race that , he said , would now focus in large part on the incumbent s ties to mr abramoff mr hayworth s chief of staff , joe eule , said in a statement that he did not take mr mitchell s threats seriously and that the congressman had no intention of returning the money he said that mr hayworth , cochairman of the house native american caucus , has been a hero to tribes nationwide and that it was not surprising that tribes , including a few formerly affiliated with mr abramoff , have been generous in supporting mr hayworth s political efforts the research by the center for responsive politics shows that of the top 25 congressional recipients of political money linked to mr abramoff , 19 are republicans and 6 are democrats the second largest recipient was listed as house speaker j dennis hastert of illinois , with 69 , 000 in donations the democrats include , tied at no 16 , senator harry reid of nevada , his party s senate leader , who received a total of 30 , 500 asked if mr reid was considering whether to return the money , his office said in a statement that he was reviewing the circumstances of the donations the top democrat on the list , who at no 8 took in 42 , 500 , is representative patrick j kennedy of rhode island , who sits on the house appropriations committee , which determines how the federal budget is divided sean richardson , a spokesman for the lawmaker , said that mr kennedy was a founder of the native american caucus , that he had a direct personal relationship with tribes and that none of it has anything to do with jack abramoff only days before mr burns announced last week that he would return 150 , 000 in contributions linked to mr abramoff and his partners , his office had insisted that the donations were proper and had already been spent there s nothing to return , his spokesman , james pendleton , said at the time the center for responsive politics , which did not include donations from mr abramoff s lobbying partners in its calculations , found that since 1999 mr burns received 49 , 590 from mr abramoff s indian tribe clients mr burns is widely seen as one of the most vulnerable republican incumbents in next year s senate elections a recent poll by montana state university showed him with an approval rating of less than 50 percent news reports in montana have documented how he took a series of actions favorable to mr abramoff s clients around the time he received large campaign contributions linked to the lobbyist insisting that his actions were never tied to donations , mr burns wrote to attorney general alberto r gonzales last month , asking that his ties to mr abramoff be reviewed quickly by the justice department so he could be cleared of wrongdoing before next year s election i welcome your thorough and expeditious review of this matter so that it may be disposed of officially once and for all and these outrageous and wrongful allegations may be put to rest before we get into the 2006 reelection cycle , mr burns wrote correction february 2 , 2006 , thursday an article on dec 19 about pressure on members of congress to return political contributions linked to the indicted lobbyist jack abramoff referred imprecisely to donations to representative j d hayworth , republican of arizona , who was identified by the center for responsive politics as the largest single congressional recipient of the donations the congressman received 101 , 000 that the center said was donated by mr abramoff and his family , indian tribes and a gambling cruise ship line that he once owned it did not include donations from mr abramoff s lobbying partners or other associates this correction was delayed by research
'the botanist and the vintner' how wine was saved for the world by christy campbell illustrated 320 pages algonquin books of chapel hill 2495 imagine a world with no champagne , no bordeaux , no burgundy no french wine at all , in fact it almost happened even worse , it was all our fault in the mid19th century , a few tiny aphids , clinging to exported american vines , gained a foothold in france , and inch by inch began devouring the greatest vineyards on earth what the black death was to humans , the phylloxera epidemic was to grapevines a mysterious , unstoppable killer that ravaged not only france but nearly all the winegrowing world in the botanist and the vintner , christy campbell , a reporter for the sunday telegraph in london , gives a taut , suspensefilled account of this calamity , and the frantic efforts by botanists and winemakers to reverse it they waged a protracted campaign for 20 years the phylloxera raged , as the authorities helplessly recorded its progress on maps and winegrowers resisted the idea that an insect could be responsible for their woes mr campbell presents his drama in three acts , humorously titled denial , anger and acceptance the stakes , however , were deadly serious by midcentury , wine production accounted for onesixth of government revenues in france the nation s secondlargest export , after textiles , it employed a third of the population wine was also an important part of the national identity , and as the phylloxera spread to france s fabled chateaux and legendary wine districts , the struggle took on apocalyptic overtones addressing a congress of vintners in lyons in 1872 , with the enemy nibbling at the gates , the botanist jules mile planchon was only echoing national sentiment when he warned if burgundy should be wiped out along with bordeaux one could say that france itself had been overthrown planchon is the botanist of the book s title , which is somewhat misleading many botanists , entomologists and vintners played a role in identifying the phylloxera , studying its life cycle and devising a means to defeat it it was planchon , however , a professor at the prestigious montpellier school of pharmacy , who deserves credit for identifying the phylloxera aphid as the cause of the mysterious vine sickness that growers first observed in the 1860 s in the lower rh ne valley , and for tracing its origins to america he waged an uphill battle to convince french growers , and even his fellow scientists , that a tiny american insect was responsible for the shriveled leaves and blackened roots in their vineyards at first , the sickness was attributed to the usual culprits , bad weather , soil exhaustion , fungus or rot no one believed that an insect was to blame because none could be seen on the roots of dead vines the explanation was simple the phylloxera , after sucking the life out of a root , moved on to the next vine as the south fell to the insect invasion , the rest of france carried on as though nothing were happening in the gironde , home of bordeaux wine , some officials dismissed talk of the phylloxera as a hoax in burgundy , local opinion regarded the epidemic as divine punishment for overproduction by their greedy southern neighbors across france , the pattern repeated itself winegrowers scoffed at the problem until it turned up on their doorstep then they panicked no one knew what to do when insecticides and burning failed , growers began trying anything and everything there was plenty of free advice from all quarters some suggested placing vials of holy water from lourdes in the fields others proposed that live toads be buried in blighted vineyards to draw poison from the soil in beaujolais , schoolboys were brought to the vineyards twice a day to urinate on the vines when the government offered a large cash prize for a solution to the problem , creative minds got to work the ministry of agriculture was advised to try exorcism , mesmerism or electrical commotions marching bands might repel the invader one applicant described a beating wheelbarrow , with mallets that would pound the soil and drive the phylloxera into the sea or across the border mr campbell skillfully explains the various threads of research , while cutting back , cinematically , to document the onward march of the pest there s a sweaty urgency to his tale , as one wine region after another falls victim to the plague , with science hot on the trail in the end , salvation came from the very country that had caused the catastrophe here and there , isolated researchers and winegrowers had observed that certain american vines , which belong to a different species than european ones , suffered no ill effects from the phylloxera for a brief , terrifying period , the french worried that they might have to make wine from american grapes the cure , it seemed , might be worse than the disease the countrylife correspondent for le temps , after attending a halfdozen tastings of american wines , reported that not one of those who took part had the courage to empty his glass america would save france , although not american grapes botanists discovered that by grafting traditional european vines onto american roots , the french could make the same wines they always had it was not a moment too soon the phylloxera had spread to italy , portugal , germany and switzerland eastern europe had succumbed , and even large swaths of australia oddly enough , one of the most successful american roots , particularly suitable for chalky soil , came from texas , just down the road a piece from crawford to warm up frenchamerican relations , president bush might like to mention the fact the next time he is in paris
bernard j ebbers , the former chief executive of worldcom , and his finance chief , scott d sullivan , backed out of preliminary merger talks with verizon communications in 2001 to avoid having to open the company s books to outsiders , according to testimony yesterday from mr sullivan that summer , mr sullivan said , he and mr ebbers were in merger talks with their counterparts at verizon communications but the two sides had not yet started a due diligence process that would have allowed verizon to inspect worldcom s confidential accounts according to mr sullivan , verizon s chief executive , ivan g seidenberg , had told mr ebbers that he wanted to announce a deal before labor day at that point , worldcom had been fraudulently inflating its revenue and improperly booking expenses for several quarters , according to testimony from several witnesses in the threeweekold trial in federal district court in manhattan if verizon got a chance to see all of worldcom s books , its accountants would unearth the deception , mr sullivan maintained he said he told mr ebbers , if we get to the next step with verizon , where we start to exchange nonpublic information , i have concerns according to mr sullivan , mr ebbers responded you 're right this probably is n't a good time to be talking to verizon because worldcom s shares were so low mr sullivan then told fred salerno , verizon s chief financial officer , that worldcom felt its stock price was too low and it wanted to wait until the price rose before proceeding with talks on the stand , mr sullivan said that what he told mr salerno was an excuse for calling off the talks the real reason we were stopping the negotiations , he said , was because we would have to show them nonpublic information prosecutors have accused mr ebbers of conspiracy , securities fraud and filing false reports with regulators he has denied any wrongdoing his testimony about the talks in 2001 comes as verizon considers whether to bid for mci , worldcom s original name and the name it again adopted after it sought bankruptcy protection in 2002 qwest communications international is also in talks with mci verizon declined to comment about mr sullivan s testimony or any potential bid for mci but a spokesman , eric rabe , said companies in the telecommunications business were in constant contact verizon s interest in worldcom was mentioned in a governmentfinanced report into worldcom s bankruptcy according to the report , verizon was willing to buy worldcom for 21 a share at a time when the stock was trading around 15 at a board meeting in november 2001 , some members were in favor of accepting verizon s offer , according to the report but they did not press the matter because mr ebbers apparently insisted on an offer of at least 30 per share , according to the report , which also showed that none of the directors or worldcom managers suggested hiring an investment banker to review the verizon proposal the report chastises worldcom s managers for not discussing verizon s bid with the board but mr sullivan s testimony suggests that mr ebbers wanted to play down verizon s offer because he was afraid of what the company might discover
vatican city , april 8 john paul ii , a littleknown polish cardinal when he was chosen pope in 1978 , was buried friday after a funeral mass that attracted admirers from the around the world , the important and the ordinary alike , in the hundreds of thousands none of us can ever forget how , in the last easter sunday of his life , the holy father , marked by suffering , came once more to the window of the apostolic palace and one last time gave his blessing , cardinal joseph ratzinger , who had known the pope for nearly three decades , said in his homily as he pointed up from st peter s square to the window of the papal apartment we can be sure that our beloved pope is standing today at the window of the father s house , that he sees and blesses us , cardinal ratzinger added in the homily , which he read in italian yes , bless us , holy father the crowd , which filled st peter s square and flowed down to the tiber river , broke into applause , as a breeze billowed flags from around the world , caught the red hats of cardinals and flipped the pages of the book of the gospel resting on john paul s plain cypress coffin amid tight security and worry over a terror attack , helicopter rotors chopped through the sound of latin hymns throughout the threehour ceremony it was the biggest funeral for a pope in the nearly 2 , 000year history of the office to the coffin s right were heads of state or government from more than 70 countries , an unprecedented collection of power for a papal funeral in the second row , the first american president to attend a pope s funeral , george w bush , sat next to his wife , laura prime minister tony blair of britain and prince charles , and presidents aleksander kwasniewski of poland , mohammad khatami of iran and moshe katsav of israel all attended , along with five kings and six queens , as well as the united nations secretary general , kofi annan there were representatives from all the world s major religions behind the coffin , in bright red robes , sat more than 100 cardinals one of whom is almost certain to become the next pope in the coming weeks and on the streets , the huge pilgrimage that has swamped rome since john paul died last saturday at age 84 continued in force around st peter s , though not in the same extraordinary numbers as during the four days his body was on display inside the basilica an estimated two million people had filed past his bier since monday , amid a total surge of pilgrims over the week that italian officials estimated at three million or more but on friday , with so many world leaders present and the risk for trouble high , the italian authorities all but shut down central rome , making it difficult to get to st peter s square car and truck traffic was banned as vip motorcades zipped in and then out of town and schools and public offices were closed security helicopters and fighter jets flew around airspace closed to private planes rather than march downtown , tens of thousands of people watched the funeral on nearly 30 huge television displays around rome italian officials said about one million people in all had watched the funeral in public around the city but no amount of security or hardship could keep away from st peter s the most devoted , including perhaps several hundred thousand poles who had driven to italy , many lacking several days of sleep and a place to stay redandwhite polish flags , many topped with black ribbons of mourning , waved in huge numbers in the square he broke communism , and he loved peace , said tom czuwara , 17 , from warsaw , explaining why he and 50 schoolmates drove 30 hours to be at the funeral kyrian atuogo , 27 , spent nearly a year s salary to come to rome from nigeria , and came to the funeral with a friend carrying a huge greenandwhite nigerian flag he is like the president of the world , mr atuogo , a civil servant , said of the pope he was so nice to us , so we decided to spend our money to give him our last respects some carried huge banners reading in italian , santo subito a plea to make john paul a saint immediately it was , in all , a day of extraordinary spectacle and tradition , played out on the ancient streets around the vatican , in piazzas around rome and , above all , in st peter s square , enfolded in the ellipse of bernini s graceful colonnade , in the company of the obelisk dragged from alexandria by the emperor caligula and a dome designed by michelangelo the last major papal funeral was for paul vi in august 1978 , and it attracted as many as 100 , 000 people , a number the vatican said made it the largest papal funeral ever ninetyfive nations were represented then , but only a handful by heads of state the funeral for john paul who had himself traveled to 129 countries as pope was of a different order , in size , in the guest list from many of the countries he had visited and in the outpouring of affection , even among those who differed with him on many issues he followed doctrine too much , said francesca tatoli , 20 , a student who nonetheless traveled enthusiastically from the southern italian city of bari to attend the funeral she said she disagreed strongly with john paul s condemnation of contraception , a position that she said did not help stop the spread of aids at the same time , he was a good man , she said , and that s why all these people are here in fact , the funeral s guest list alone stood as a distinctive testament to john paul that such a wide spectrum of people , many of whom normally would not be in the same room , all found themselves sitting together such a long and eventful papacy gave them all much to admire , but also much to take issue with , or in death , to simply ignore he reached out like no other pope to jews and muslims , and political and religious leaders came to the funeral from israel and saudi arabia alike , even as the church continued to view jesus christ as the only true mediator of salvation his views on abortion and the sanctity of human life resonated with mr bush s conservative politics , even if his opposition to capital punishment and to both wars in iraq did not his stance on iraq , however , helped his popularity among many muslims many italians , as with liberal catholics , liked his warmth and concern about poverty and social justice , even while ignoring him on issues like contraception , divorce or abortion in his homily , cardinal ratzinger , 77 , sketched out the life of john paul , saying the key to understanding him was the phrase christ spoke to peter after his resurrection follow me he spoke of karol wojtyla s loss of his mother at a young age his working in a chemical plant in poland his love as a young man of philosophy , theology and poetry his pastoral work as a priest he roused us from a lethargic faith , from the sleep of the disciples of both yesterday and today , said cardinal ratzinger , a conservative who is expected to play a major role in selecting the next pope he also spoke of john paul s illness and age the pope suffered , he said , and loved in communion with christ , and that is why the message of his suffering and his silence proved so eloquent and so fruitful for all that was unprecedented about john paul s funeral , the basics followed centuries of vatican tradition it was a mass , if one spoken in parts in 10 languages , and so there were no other speakers or testimonials apart from cardinal ratzinger s homily on friday morning , as guests gathered for the funeral , john paul s body was sprinkled with holy water and his face covered with a white veil by his longtime personal secretary , archbishop stanislaw dziwisz the body was sealed in a cypress coffin , then carried out of the basilica by 12 pallbearers in black the crowd erupted in applause when the coffin marked with a cross and an m for the virgin mary came out into the sun and was placed at the top of the stairs after the mass , the coffin was carried into the grottoes beneath the basilica , built over the spot where the tomb of st peter , who brought christianity to rome , is by tradition situated there , amid the bodies of more than 70 of the 264 popes , the cypress coffin was placed inside a zinc coffin , which was then closed inside a walnut casket in his last testament , made public on thursday , john paul requested that he be interred in the earth , not above ground he was buried in the spot that had held pope john xxiii before his body was moved to a sepulcher inside the basilica in 2001 but before the coffin was taken to the grottoes , the pallbearers lifted it off the basilica steps and then , carefully turning around , held it out to face the tens of thousands of pilgrims in the crowd for a prolonged moment the bell of st peter s tolled waves of applause swept through the crowd , as many of the pilgrims wept i knew the ceremony today would be majestic , but i did n't realize how moved i would be by the service itself , mr bush told reporters on air force one on friday as he flew home today s ceremony , i bet you , was a reaffirmation for millions
so it s come to this woody allen directing an episode of friends the joke about the sitcom used to be that none of its carefree 20something characters could have afforded to live in the spacious greenwich village apartments the producers imagined for them mr allen s new movie , melinda and melinda , with its detailed rendering of several manhattan apartments , has sparked similar skepticism among realestatesavvy new yorkers the film comprises two linked stories , one comic , the other tragic , and part of its message is that there is a gray area at the point tragedy and comedy overlap actually , it s not a gray area , it s a twobedroom coop and boy , is it nicely furnished ! the tragic tale presents a young couple living in a loftlike space somewhere downtown the apartment has a 10foothigh , exposedbeam ceiling , massive wooden pillars , a dining room , a guest room , an open kitchen , a grand piano in the living room , lots of comfortable oversize furniture , framed art on the walls , large windows , expensive curtains and wooden blinds the wife , played by chloe sevigny , though described as a park avenue princess , works occasionally as a music teacher her husband is a struggling actor in the comic story , the failed actor of a husband \( will ferrell \) and his aspiring filmmaker wife \( amanda peet \) live in a town house apartment on the upper east side , with builtin hardwood cabinetry in the living room , comfortable furniture , a dining room and a new rug for some reason , every other apartment in the movie has a grand piano , but mr ferrell and ms peet have to do without in his review in the new york times , ao scott noted that the real pornography on screen involved housing as he put it the kind of new yorkers likely to see a woody allen movie reserve their true lust for real estate which leads to the really important question what s all this space worth \? wendy j sarasohn , a senior vice president and broker with the corcoran group , estimated that the two main apartments would cost 2 million each she placed the downtown apartment in chelsea and guessed that it contained at least 2 , 000 square feet , adding , there s no way that a teacher and an outofwork actor could be living there the upper east side apartment looked to her like a classic six , a large prewar unit with a dining room , living room and at least two bedrooms , and seemed equally out of the characters' reach she s a director s assistant , and he s an outofwork actor , ms sarasohn said they could not be in this apartment but michele kleier , a president of the real estate brokerage gumley haft kleier , noted that both apartments were walkups and thus more affordable she also suggested that the downtown apartment would not be quite so much a reach if the sevigny character were indeed a park avenue princess she s typical of all the trust fund babies i deal with , where her parents gave her the down payment , ms kleier said mom and dad would have paid for the decorator too , she added rick kelly , a broker with prudential douglas elliman , also put a slightly lower price tag on the two main settings , about 17 million for the downtown apartment , which looked to him like a soho loft , perhaps on crosby or greene street , and as little as 11 million for the uptown space mr allen himself is no stranger to bigticket real estate last year he sold his east 92nd street town house for 245 million ms sarasohn , the corcoran broker , took a client to see the place and was surprised to find that the director was home and keen to lead a tour of the house himself he was very proud to show the water pressure in his shower , she said in his bedroom , at the foot of his bed , there was a tv that came up from a chest he thought that was the coolest thing in the world and the town house had a back yard that was beautiful , and it was clear he 'd never been out there because he could n't open the door and he commented that he preferred the indoors not surprisingly , just as the lines between tragedy and comedy sometimes blur , so do the lines between the cinematic and the real , or in this case , real estate the other day , after ms sarasohn spent a full day schlepping around manhattan with a househunting couple from ohio , the exhausted pair had just one question where are those apartments that were in 'melinda and melinda' and how come they 're not on the market \?
leaders of the transit workers' union rejected the metropolitan transportation authority s latest contract offer last night , and voted to call a strike shortly after 1 am , according to two members of the union s executive board but the vote to call a strike was not unanimous , and so for at least a half an hour after the formal vote , union leaders remained divided on whether to actually proceed with the walkout adding to the confusion , the president of the transport workers union of america , the parent union for the city s transit workers , told the local executive board he could not support a strike , the two members said they said that the president , michael t o'brien , said he believed that the transportation authority might change its offer , and he urged the union to reenter the talks a transit strike , the city s first in a quarter century , would prevent people from going to work , cause hundreds of millions of dollars in economic damage and upend the life of the city in the week before christmas the vote by the union board came after a 12hour round of intense negotiations between the two pivotal figures in the talks peter s kalikow , the transportation authority s chairman , and roger toussaint , president of local 100 of the transport workers union who bargained facetoface yesterday for the first time since friday but with just an hour to go before the deadline , tom kelly , an authority spokesman , said that efforts to settle the dispute had faltered after the union turned down what he called a fair offer unfortunately , that offer has been rejected by the transport workers union , and they have advised us that they were going that they are going to leave the building , and going to the union hall , mr kelly said the mta remains ready to continue negotiations union officials would not discuss the developments as they headed into their private strategy session the developments capped a day in which the transit union stepped up the pressure by beginning a strike yesterday morning against two queens bus lines , stranding about 57 , 000 passengers in what the union portrayed as a prelude to a strike that would shut down the nation s largest transit system the union first threatened to shut down the whole system on friday , but pushed back the deadline to today , seemingly to increase its leverage by warning of a walkout the week before christmas , one of the busiest weeks for retailers the state s taylor law prohibits strikes by public employees and carries penalties of two days' pay for each day on strike as a result of all the threats and deadlines , many new yorkers for the second straight week felt wildly off balance , straining to figure out how their children would get to school and how they would get to work or to doctors' appointments some new yorkers backed the transit workers , some saw them as greedy lawbreakers , and some said that both sides in the negotiations deserved the public s disdain warning that a strike would be illegal , gov george e pataki and mayor michael r bloomberg stepped up their campaign to pressure the union , with the mayor saying that a strike would be reprehensible the city and state and courts everybody is going to enforce the law , and anybody that thinks that they can just go break the law is sadly mistaken , mr bloomberg said there can be no winners in a strike it s not going to force the mta to make a settlement if anything , it s going to probably dig them in at rallies outside the governor s office and in queens alongside the striking bus workers , mr toussaint and many union members trumpeted their defiance , insisting that it was more important to obtain what they viewed as a just contract than to obey the law barring strikes unless there is substantial movement by the authority , trains and buses will come to a halt as of midnight tonight , he said at a rally for the bus workers in east elmhurst , queens with anger in his voice , he added , we maintain , as we have in the past week , that threats are not going to produce a contract and are not going to work against us later , at a rally outside the governor s office in manhattan , he sought to justify a walkout by saying , there s a calling that is higher than the law , and that s the calling of justice city officials have prepared an emergency plan that would increase ferry service , allow taxis to pick up multiple fares , close several streets to traffic except for buses and emergency vehicles , and prohibit cars with fewer than four passengers from entering manhattan below 96th street during the morning rush the city is also deploying hundreds of police officers to secure subway entrances in the event of a walkout the transportation authority s 11thhour offer included a 3 percent raise in the first year , 4 percent in the second year and 35 percent in the third year of a new contract , representatives on both sides said before yesterday , it was offering 3 percent a year for three straight years the authority dropped its demand to raise the retirement age for a full pension to 62 for new employees , up from 55 for current employees but the authority proposed that all future transit workers pay 6 percent of their wages toward their pensions , up from the 2 percent that current workers pay the transportation authority asserts that it needs to bring its soaring pension costs under control to stave off future deficits but union leaders vow that they will not sell out future transit workers by saddling them with lesser benefits earlier yesterday , mr toussaint hinted at some movement in the talks at the grand hyatt hotel , saying that the union would reduce its wage demands to 6 percent a year , from 8 percent a year , if the authority promised to reduce the number of disciplinary actions brought against transit workers the authority has offered raises of 3 percent a year for three years the union began its strike against two queens bus lines , jamaica buses inc and triboro coach corporation , in the hope of pressuring the authority to reach an overall settlement the walkout angered many queens commuters and caused many to squeeze into vans and taxis the 707 workers at the two bus companies have been without a contract for 33 months the authority is taking control of those two companies and five others , and union officials assert that the strike against the companies is not prohibited because the authority has not taken full control of them the public employment relations board , a state body that oversees labor relations for government employees , did not issue a decision yesterday in response to a complaint that the union filed on sunday , asserting that the authority had violated state law by including its pension demands as part of what it said was its final offer the union has asked the labor board to seek an injunction ordering the authority to drop its pension demand at 9 15 pm yesterday , the board s executive director , james r edgar , said the board had not yet received the authority s legal papers replying to the union many new yorkers said a strike would disrupt their lives doreen simon , 55 , who lives in crown heights , brooklyn , and works as a housekeeper in riverdale , the bronx , said , i'm going to stay home what can i do \? i ca n't take a cab to the bronx it s going to hurt the union has repeatedly urged mr pataki to join the talks , trying to put the onus on him if there is a walkout but the governor , like the mayor , says that the professionals at the authority should handle the talks workers at the metronorth railroad and long island rail road are not expected to strike in support of transit workers anthony j bottalico , the chairman of the union that represents

v s pritchett a working life by jeremy treglown illustrated 334 pp random house 2595 a working life the subtitle is exact even in his 80 s , the english writer v s pritchett \( 190097 \) would go fast up the four flights of steep stairs to my study every day of the week , at 9 o'clock in the morning he would light his pipe , put a pastry board across the arms of his chair and begin to roll out the words of a review or a story the hours until lunch would seem but a few minutes there were more words before dinner , and sometimes after it too , and every now and then he would go on writing in my sleep , in english mostly but often , out of vanity , in spanish it was all done by hand with paper and pen , his part of it anyway his wife , dorothy , typed up the work of the day before , making a clean copy for him to cover with an ant s colony of corrections that was the conventional division of labor , and in other ways too the elderly writer might have passed for a conventional man , someone you could mistake , in jeremy treglown s words , for the chairman of an old established family business but that equipoise did not come easily , and one of the strengths of v s pritchett a working life is that treglown shows how hard both pritchetts had to fight for it for one thing , pritchett s steady productivity remained a financial necessity even into old age he was the best shortstory writer of his era in britain only elizabeth bowen compares but collections of stories sold no better at midcentury than they do now the greater struggle , though , was dorothy s a long fight with alcohol that kept the marriage on edge throughout the 1950 s from that perspective , some of pritchett s travel writing and teaching gigs look like escapes , and treglown notes , tactfully yet firmly , how much his successes owed to dorothy , and how much they had cost her nevertheless , the marriage lasted , with help from both alcoholics anonymous and what their letters suggest was the enduring power of sexual love this compact biography is treglown s third , preceded by similarly scaled lives of roald dahl and henry green by now , it s possible to generalize about the biographer s own work none of his subjects had an epic life or career , and each falls between the standard categories of literary fame the macabre children s book writer , the avantgarde novelist whose work ended in a 20year silence , the disciplined professional whose public face was that of a sly and avuncular critic in each case , treglown , the former editor of the times literary supplement , has produced an oblique portrait more attentive to the flavor of the life than to its chronology there s little here , for example , on pritchett s critical reception or his relations with other writers , and little too about magazines like the new statesman , where he labored so long as an editor and contributor rather than competing with pritchett s great autobiography , a cab at the door , and its portrait of his improvident dickensian father , treglown severely telescopes the writer s early years , moving between the texture and texts of his life in order to show how pritchett himself massaged it into form what a price one pays for one s material , pritchett once wrote in his stories , he found that material in england s lower middle class , a world of shopkeepers and traveling salesmen in which , as treglown suggests , the humdrum and the caricatural merged some of his contemporaries found this uncomfortably close to the work of the ealing studios today , that seems a strength pritchett had an ear for proverbial speech and drew on it for titles you make your own life , the key to my heart but he could always finger the spot of difference hidden inside the clich and he had a knack for the idiolect that distinguishes one character s voice from another s one of his best tales , the oedipus complex , traps its narrator in a dentist s chair , forcing him to listen as the man chips his way through both a tooth and his life s story it s a mockheroic drama made out of nothing at all reading it is like watching someone turn backflips most of pritchett s stories are comedies that have what he called a militant , tragic edge this reflected his belief in the duty of writers to justify their people , for we all feel that for good or ill , we are exceptional the one limitation of these stories is the degree to which they seem , as pritchett put it , so very native english his essays display his mastery of other european traditions , but his fiction remains almost untranslatably islandbound it s hard to think of an american equivalent maybe sarah orne jewett \? the lonely obsessives of her coastal maine echo pritchett s in london then again , this comparison is like the odd juxtapositions on which his own criticism so often and far more confidently relied pritchett , says treglown , was britain s greatest writercritic since virginia woolf , an assessment that highlights pritchett s strengths and also his limitations his taste was more wideranging than woolf s , and he did not try to remake the subjects of his essays in his own image , preferring instead to particularize their idiosyncrasies saying just what makes balzac into balzac in a manner analogous to his insistence on each person s exceptional quality his language is quick and rich and densely imagistic he saw twain and poe , for example , as a pair of spiritual derelicts two scarecrow figures with their halflynched minds but pritchett s own mind remains almost too responsive , too free of idiosyncrasy his criticism lacks a fully defined aesthetic nothing in his work is comparable to woolf s critical response to arnold bennett , mr bennett and mrs brown still , his darting paragraphs testify to a range of knowledge unmatched by any 20thcentury critic we should have a book of selected essays to complement the new modern library volume of essential stories treglown has culled from pritchett s short fiction some of pritchett s best criticism was on the work of his friend henry green treglown s own biography of green , romancing , is one of the finest literary biographies of the past decade , and v s pritchett does n't quite match it , in part because treglown stays too often within the vacuum of pritchett s family life rather than locating him firmly within his now fading cultural milieu but maybe anything more would have made such a sharply tailored volume pop a seam slender but full , this life does its work , and does it well michael gorra is the author , most recently , of the bells in their silence travels through germany he is chairman of the english department at smith college

not long after the regular season ends , coaching changes in the national football league will begin many teams , including oakland , houston , buffalo and new orleans , have failed to meet expectations , and the coaches in those cities will likely not escape unscathed it appears that the texans' owner , bob mcnair , will fire coach dom capers , particularly after mcnair s hiring monday of dan reeves , a veteran former head coach , as a consultant the team s general manager , charlie casserly , is also under fire now that the texans \( 112 \) are almost certain to finish with the worst record in their fouryear history we will wait until the end of the year before we make any determinations for next year , mcnair said monday at the news conference to announce reeves s hiring none of us are happy with the performance of our team this year we 're all disappointed it s very frustrating this is a crucial stage for mcnair s franchise , with houston the frontrunner to earn the no 1 pick in the draft but even if the texans land reggie bush , the heisman trophy winner , they will not turn things around unless they can build a solid offense around him and quarterback david carr , the no 1 pick in 2002 , whose play remains erratic reeves is being asked to evaluate the organization , and he made it clear that he will not undermine capers however , reeves did not rule out returning to coaching if asked never is a bad word , to say you 'll never be a head coach again , reeves said at the news conference but am i actively looking \? no did bob call me and ask me if i was interested in being the head coach \? no he called and asked if i was interested in helping him by being a consultant regardless of reeves s role , capers may have a difficult time convincing mcnair to give him another season frustration is also evident in oakland , where the raiders \( 49 \) are about to post three consecutive losing seasons for the first time since the owner , al davis , became involved with the team in 1963 davis has never been shy about firing coaches , and norv turner s reputation as an offensive guru has taken a hit during his two seasons with the raiders oakland was expected to have a potent offense after acquiring randy moss and lamont jordan , but the raiders have averaged only 199 points a game turner benched quarterback kerry collins against the jets in favor of marques tuiasosopo , but on wednesday , turner announced he was returning to collins for sunday s game against cleveland it s too late for either quarterback to save the raiders' season , and davis may decide it is too late for turner to save his job both buffalo \( 49 \) and new orleans \( 310 \) have faltered badly after barely missing the playoffs last season considering what the saints have endured in the aftermath of hurricane katrina , coach jim haslett may get another chance , but the saints have not reached the playoffs since haslett s first season in 2000 i would like to know something before the end of the season , but again , that s up to him , haslett said to reporters on wednesday , speaking of the owner , tom benson in buffalo , mike mularkey may need his team to finish the season strongly to salvage his job i'm not looking at it like that , he told reporters this week my job is to get us to win these games , not for any other reasons james willing to rest if indianapolis coach tony dungy decides to rest his starters before the playoffs , it could cost edgerrin james the nfl rushing title james enters sunday s game against the chargers with 1 , 440 yards rushing , trailing only seattle s shaun alexander \( 1 , 496 yards \) dungy said his starters would play sunday , but he may rest them the final two weeks , considering the unbeaten colts \( 130 \) have already clinched the american football conference south title and homefield advantage for the playoffs james , who has won two rushing titles , said his main concern was winning the super bowl i 've had it before , james said of the title , speaking in the locker room after last sunday s victory against jacksonville if you can get a rushing title , that s cool , but we 're not going to go out of our way , he said if coach says , 'edge , i want you to go out and get the rushing title , ' i 'll accept every carry but if he says , 'edge , i want you to sit down , ' i 'll sit down james and terrell owens , the banished philadelphia eagles receiver , have the same agent , drew rosenhaus unlike owens , james has enjoyed a controversyfree season , despite his unhappiness with the colts for not signing him to a longterm contract but there is no guarantee that james will resign with indianapolis after this season because of salary cap restrictions and his own expectations if not , dungy would undoubtedly miss him he runs hard , picks up the tough yardage for us , he catches the ball out of the backfield , and he s the best passprotecting good back i 've seen , like marcus allen or walter payton , dungy said the yearafter hangover losing the super bowl leaves teams with a worse hangover than too much tequila the eagles became the fifth consecutive super bowl loser to miss the playoffs the following season , joining the giants \( 2001 \) , st louis \( 2002 \) , oakland \( 2003 \) and carolina \( 2004 \) eagles safety brian dawkins blames a rash of injuries for philadelphia s demise , not a postsuper bowl letdown for me , what happened this year , with this team , with all the injuries and stuff , i ca n't put too much into it , dawkins said to reporters wednesday i do n't know that we have to make significant changes , he said but i know we can trust that they upstairs will make the decisions that need to be made this offseason i just want the guys to get back 100 percent , so that we can get to next year running full speed photos in houston , fans are asking what s up with the 112 texans above , dan reeves , hired this week as a consultant , could replace coach dom capers the raiders have had a headscratching season under norv turner , above aaron brooks and the saints are sitting in last \( photos by brett coomer associated press shadow dave einsel associated press fan pat sullivan associated press reeves and capers ray stubblebine reuters turner ric feld associated press brooks \)

united nations , march 25 a report from the commission investigating corruption in the united nations oilforfood program in iraq is likely to criticize secretary general kofi annan for failing to perceive the appearance of a conflict of interest posed by his son s employment by a program contractor it will also say that the son , kojo annan , received more than twice the compensation the company had long acknowledged according to an investigator and another person who has read the current draft , the report will fault both mr annan for his management practices and his son , who it will say was paid nearly 400 , 000 between 1996 and 2004 by cotecna inspection services , the swissbased company that had a contract to monitor the humanitarian goods that iraq bought under the 65 billion program the report , from the investigative commission led by paul a volcker , a former federal reserve chairman , is to be made public tuesday any conclusions by the commission that secretary general annan bears responsibility for the actions of his son will come as a setback for the beleaguered secretary general he has continually maintained that he knew little about his son s activities and that he was disappointed that his son misinformed him we still believe that the secretary general will be cleared of any wrongdoing , mark malloch brown , the united nations chief of staff , said in a telephone interview on friday the fact is that kojo has confirmed that he misled his father , and a father cannot be held accountable for the deeds of an adult son that the son has not told his father about the 400 , 000 figure and the volcker commission s expected findings about mr annan and his son first appeared in the wall street journal on friday the commission has not uncovered any evidence that mr annan benefited financially or intervened in any way to influence selection of contractors in the oilforfood program but one investigator said the report faulted mr annan for failing to be sensitive to the perception of nepotism and conflict of interest that inevitably arose from his son s involvement with a united nations contractor the report will explore in some detail not only kojo annan s relationship with cotecna , but also his relationship with his father , said a person familiar with the document s content it will not be pleasant reading for them the report will add to the atmosphere of crisis that is buffeting the united nations at a moment when it is making senior staff changes and proposing structural and management reforms intended to forestall a recurrence of the kinds of abuses that have drawn the critical attention of five congressional committees as well as calls for mr annan to step down before his term is completed at the end of 2006 on monday , mr annan made public a wideranging set of changes , including a reconstitution of the security council and the restructuring of the human rights commission , which has brought repeated discredit on the united nations by letting major rights violators become members on thursday , a confessional united nations report proposed a thorough overhaul of the peacekeeping operation , which has been shamed by instances of rape and sexual abuse of minors by bluehelmeted united nations troops but attention has already shifted back to the institution s oilforfood problems and in particular mr annan s job security in light of his son s activities asked about the higher compensation figure for kojo annan , seth goldschlager , a spokesman for cotecna , said in an interview friday that the company had told the volcker commission that it paid him at least 366 , 000 and possibly as much as 400 , 000 during the 1996 to 2004 period in which he received payments the amount included payments for health care and to ensure that he not work for competitors after he formally left cotecna in 1998 mr goldschlager said the new total was provided to investigators after the financial times and il sole ore 24 of milan jointly reported wednesday that kojo annan had been paid at least 300 , 000 , not just the 175 , 000 that had been previously disclosed mr goldschlager said cotecna was still uncertain exactly how much mr annan had been paid and that as a result of negotiations with the volcker panel , the company was conducting a new audit of all payments to him congressional investigators have complained that cotecna has disclosed the widening scope of its dealings with kojo annan only after being prodded by news reports and has not fully explained payments made through third parties mr goldschlager said friday that these payments had been made at kojo annan s request , but he could not explain why cotecna had agreed to an arrangement that appeared to disguise the company s involvement echoing previous statements by other cotecna representatives , mr goldschlager said the continuing payments to mr annan after he left the company were not illegal or inappropriate he also denied allegations that cotecna had hired and continued paying kojo annan after he left the company to maintain his father s good will or retain its contract he said mr annan was paid for his work on behalf of cotecna in africa , none of which , he asserted , was related to the oilforfood program the noncompetition payments were consistent with what is standard practice in the industry , he added kojo annan worked for cotecna from december 1995 until departing at the end of 1998 , just as the company gained its oilforfood contract as the oilforfood scandal unfolded , united nations spokesmen deflected questions about any conflict posed by young mr annan s job by noting that all his work was done in africa , distant from iraq , and that he had severed ties with cotecna at the time it became an oilforfood contractor subsequent disclosures revealed that kojo annan continued receiving payments until february 2004 and that he had attended united nationsconnected meetings in new york and durban , south africa in december 2004 the senior mr annan said that although he and his son had discussed the relationship with cotecna , he was disappointed that he had apparently not been told the full story tuesday s report will be mr volcker s second interim report , with the final accounting due this summer in its first interim report , on feb 4 , the commission found that the former head of the program , benon v sevan , had a grave and continuing conflict of interest in helping a friend obtain valuable iraqi oil contracts and said a second united nations official , joseph stephanides , had violated procurement rules both men have been suspended and are in the process of answering united nations charges against them correction march 29 , 2005 , tuesday a headline on saturday about the expected findings of the commission investigating corruption in the united nations oilforfood program in iraq referred incorrectly to previously unacknowledged payments made by the program contractor to kojo annan , who had been a contractor employee and is the son of secretary general kofi annan the contractor , contecna inspection services , said the payments were related to kojo annan s work on behalf of cotecna in africa , not to the oilforfood program
let s say you are an 18yearold kid with a really big brain you 're trying to figure out which field of study you should devote your life to , so you can understand the forces that will be shaping history for decades to come go into the field that barely exists cultural geography study why and how people cluster , why certain national traits endure over centuries , why certain cultures embrace technology and economic growth and others resist them this is the line of inquiry that is now impolite to pursue the gospel of multiculturalism preaches that all groups and cultures are equally wonderful there are a certain number of closeminded thugs , especially on university campuses , who accuse anybody who asks intelligent questions about groups and enduring traits of being racist or sexist the economists and scientists tend to assume that material factors drive history resources and brain chemistry because that s what they can measure and count but none of this helps explain a crucial feature of our time while global economies are converging , cultures are diverging , and the widening cultural differences are leading us into a period of conflict , inequality and segmentation not long ago , people said that globalization and the revolution in communications technology would bring us all together but the opposite is true people are taking advantage of freedom and technology to create new groups and cultural zones old national identities and behavior patterns are proving surprisingly durable people are moving into selfsegregating communities with people like themselves , and building invisible and sometimes visible barriers to keep strangers out if you look just around the united states you find amazing cultural segmentation we in america have been globalized \( meaning economically integrated \) for centuries , and yet far from converging into some homogeneous culture , we are actually diverging into lifestyle segments the music , news , magazine and television markets have all segmented , so there are fewer cultural unifiers like life magazine or walter cronkite fortymillion americans move every year , and they generally move in with people like themselves , so as the late james chapin used to say , every place becomes more like itself crunchy places like boulder attract crunchy types and become crunchier conservative places like suburban georgia attract conservatives and become more so not long ago , many people worked on farms or in factories , so they had similar lifestyles but now the economy rewards specialization , so workplaces and lifestyles diverge the military and civilian cultures diverge in the political world , democrats and republicans seem to live on different planets meanwhile , if you look around the world you see how often events are driven by groups that reject the globalized culture islamic extremists reject the modern cultures of europe , and have created a hyperaggressive fantasy version of traditional islamic purity in a much different and less violent way , some american jews have moved to hebron and become hyperzionists from africa to seattle , religiously orthodox students reject what they see as the amoral mainstream culture and carve out defiant revival movements from rome to oregon , antiglobalization types create their own subcultures the members of these and many other groups did n't inherit their identities they took advantage of modernity , affluence and freedom to become practitioners of a doityourself tribalism they are part of a great reshuffling of identities , and the creation of new , often more rigid groupings they have the zeal of converts meanwhile , transnational dreams like european unification and arab unity falter , and behavior patterns across nations diverge for example , fertility rates between countries like the us and canada are diverging work habits between the us and europe are diverging global inequality widens as some nations with certain cultural traits prosper and others with other traits do n't people like max weber , edward banfield , samuel huntington , lawrence harrison and thomas sowell have given us an inkling of how to think about this stuff , but for the most part , this is open ground if you are 18 and you 've got that big brain , the whole field of cultural geography is waiting for you
a senate committee report to be released today suggested that the ties between the former chilean dictator gen augusto pinochet and american financial institutions were deeper and more extensive than previously disclosed senate investigators found that general pinochet was able to move millions of dollars through more than 125 bank accounts held in the united states , based on new information handed over by the institutions the 86page report showed that the moneylaundering scandal that initially focused on riggs bank , a washington institution that linked the financial and political worlds , had broadened to involve at least eight other institutions that operate in the united states and around the globe in july , the senate s permanent subcommittee on investigations concluded that riggs executives and bank regulators , even after sept 11 , 2001 , failed to monitor suspicious financial transactions involving hundreds of millions of dollars at the same time , the committee identified accounts showing that riggs had an eightyear association with general pinochet but the new report says that both riggs and citigroup had ties to him that went back more than two decades , with accounts totaling at least 9 million held by members of his family , close associates or by him personally the report also says that accounts at bank of america , banco de chile in the united states , espirito bank in miami and four offshore private banks could be linked to the former dictator the only way we can protect our financial system from the bad guys is if the banks and our securities firms know their customers , said senator carl levin , a democrat from michigan who helped lead the investigation our banks either knew their customers in the case of riggs but nonetheless courted the business of general pinochet , he added , or in the case of citibank , they did not know their customers or should have known their customers they should have known the source of the money riggs declined to comment on the report other to say that none of the employees involved remained at the company a citigroup statement acknowledged the report s factual findings of past events the other banks either could not be reached or declined to comment all of the financial institutions identified in the report cooperated with the investigation although general pinochet s relationship with citigroup dates to 1981 , all of the accounts were opened under disguised versions of his name , like jose p ugarte according to the report , the bank said its managers at the time were not aware that their client was the former dictator they assumed it was his brother or another family member citigroup told senate investigators that it closed those accounts in the mid1990 s when it found out otherwise since 1998 , all accounts belonging to other members of general pinochet s family have been closed , except for one that has been frozen bank of america held three accounts for ines lucia pinochet , general pinochet s daughter , and the chilean offices of a bankboston division it acquired had cashed two cashiers checks for general pinochet in 2001 , the report said the report sheds new light on the activities of riggs bank executives , including more than a halfdozen letters written to general pinochet by executives as high as joseph allbritton , the bank s former chairman and controlling shareholder , to solicit his business since at least early 2002 , bank regulators have been aware of the pinochet funds when they stumbled across them during a review in the aftermath of the sept 11 , 2001 , attacks , the government introduced laws and stepped up scrutiny of banking practices to guard against laundered money winding up in terrorist hands riggs bank , part of the riggs national corporation , came under regulatory scrutiny about a year ago in january , riggs bank pleaded guilty and accepted responsibility for its actions for repeatedly failing to report the suspicious transactions in multimilliondollar accounts held general pinochet and the corrupt leaders of oilrich equatorial guinea in the last year , it also has paid a total of 41 million in criminal and treasury department fines for its lax controls riggs shut its private and diplomatic banking operations late last year and put itself up for sale in july , it announced that the pnc financial services group , the pittsburghbased bank , would buy it for about 652 million but the sale has been complicated by the investigations the acquisition is expected to be complete by the end of may , riggs said
last friday , the rapper lil wayne made his way to the midtown studios of mtv with teeth , wrists and neck aglitter with jewelry , he hyped his new album , out today , then told viewers to stay tuned for an episode of cribs , featuring tours of some celebrity houses , including his he paused i do n't even have that crib no more , he said , nonchalantly due to the hurricane never mind the house , in lil wayne s hometown , new orleans , lives on in reruns , thanks to the mtv archives even before hurricane katrina , this was a busy year for lil wayne he appeared on hit records by destiny s child and bobby valentino he was named president of cash money records , the hugely influential new orleans label that signed him more than a decade ago he split with his longtime producer mannie fresh , who composed almost all of the music on lil wayne s first four solo albums he enrolled parttime at the university of houston , where he is studying for a degree in psychology and in september , he celebrated his 23rd birthday lil wayne , born d'wayne carter jr , was a professional rapper before he was a teenager he says he wrote his first rhyme at 8 when he was 10 , he caught the ear of the williams brothers , bryan \( known as baby or birdman \) and ronald \( known as slim \) , who own cash money the brothers eventually set lil wayne up with three other new orleans rappers young turk , bg and juvenile and called the group the hot boy by 1999 , when lil wayne released his solo debut , tha block is hot , he had already rapped on two of the era s most enduring hiphop hits juvenile s evergreen club track back that thing up and bg s bling bling , which changed the english language forever today , lil wayne releases tha carter ii \( cash money universal \) , his fifth solo album it s an impressive cd , and in some sense historic it is poised to become the first topselling new orleans album since the hurricane the first single , fireman , is already on the radio , and lil wayne recently shot a video for the next one , a gentle makeout song called grown man it should probably come as no surprise that the new orleans rap scene has largely been ignored by those talking and writing about new orleans over the last few months for all its mainstream success , hiphop still is n't quite respectable and yet hiphop is by far new orleans s most popular musical export , and perhaps the most exciting the city nurtures its own hiphop subgenre , bounce music \( imagine a drummachine version of a marchingband version of a funk track \) , and has churned out a fistful of mainstream stars , including master p , mystikal and juvenile , the former hot boy , who still makes hits \( his next album is due in february \) in a dressing room after the mtv session , lil wayne said he had been too preoccupied recently to worry about whether new orleans hiphop was getting its due he moved his mother out of the city to miami , where he lives these days \( he studies online , and goes to houston only for exams \) but his old new orleans neighborhood , hollygrove , was devastated , and he said he was dealing with it by trying not to think about it you really do n't want to dwell on it because if you do , you 'll bring yourself down , he said he took the same attitude when faced with his biggest musical loss the defection of mannie fresh , who left cash money earlier this year to start his own label \( the other three hot boy have also left cash money , none happily \) the jovial fresh and the precocious lil wayne made a great team on block burner , 1997 , fresh concocted a rubbery , futuristic beat and lil wayne , 14 at the time , rhymed over it in his eerie , singsong croak more recently , the two collaborated on go dj , a hit that revolved around a simple party chant that doubled as a rapper s tribute to his producer go dj 'cause that s my dj this time , lil wayne was forced to go it alone fortunately , he had already begun to change focus tha carter , released a year ago , was a showcase for increasingly intricate rhymes this evolution is no accident lil wayne knows that some people still see him as a former child star , even though he never made children s music he says that despite his success \( all of his albums have been certified gold or platinum \) , bigname rappers and producers have been slow to respond to his requests for cameo appearances but he has generally declined to take offense snoop dogg recently had a big hit with drop it like it s hot , based on a new orleans catchphrase that lil wayne popularized he responded on a mixtape track , turning an old jayz boast into an unusual perhaps unprecedented show of hiphop humility nah i ai n't a hater , do n't get me wrong i made it a hot line , you made it a hot song instead of freshmade beats , tha carter ii is full of unexpected syllables and punch lines i will put dem body on chill like glaciers gracias , i'm craziest it s obvious , going against me is atheist and near the end , he finds an unlikely replacement for his old producer robin thicke , son of the canadian actor and songwriter alan , contributes a woozy , bluesy highlight called shooter lil wayne s voice , like his flow , keeps getting better , too he can halfsing a melody like 50 cent or emit a low , slow groan like young jeezy perhaps he would like to remind us , and them , that he was doing it first , and doing it before he was old enough to drive one thing you wo n't hear on tha carter ii is the one thing you might expect a somber but hopeful song about the storm that destroyed the neighborhood he s still bragging about when asked , he will talk about hurricane katrina and its aftermath he will talk about how the displacement has destroyed family traditions you ai n't getting another good holiday , he said that ai n't happening for some years and he will talk about how displacement has also brought the wrong people together , stranding bitter enemies in toosmall towns but he says he did n't want this cd to be dominated by the hurricane when i get behind that mike , i got a whole 'nother mind frame , he said , then added , i rap about what they wanna hear he saves the hurricane commentary for journalists , he said he has found that it s a good idea to tell them what they want to hear , too it s sometimes strange to hear lil wayne still rhyming about choppers \( guns \) and dope boys and the mean streets of the old new orleans then again , considering the year he s had , this may be the only sane response in any case , tha carter ii , more than any other new cd , is sure to be heard , and perhaps loved , by displaced new orleans residents all over the country no doubt many of them will hear something both admirable and familiar in lil wayne s determination to keep rapping , keep going , no matter what i holler hollygrove on each and every song , he announces , on fly in , near the beginning of the new cd how can he stop now \?
is there room on broadway for another odd couple of singing con men \? on paper , dirty rotten scoundrels , which opened last night at the imperial theater , has an awful lot in common with the musical megahit the producers a mismatched pair of scam artists \( one a silky veteran , one a raw rookie \) a longlegged blonde as a love interest for both fellows a bubbly score comic homages to showbiz classics and the aim of vaulting over the lines of good taste whenever possible but if you are going to court comparison with giants , you had better be prepared to stand tall dirty rotten scoundrels , directed by jack o'brien and starring john lithgow and norbert leo butz as the title rogues , somehow never straightens out of a queasy slouch though shot through with bawdy jokes , smirky innuendoes and a rowdy spirit of selfparody , dirty rotten scoundrels seems to believe in its own brazen agenda only when mr butz , a criminally talented young performer , is allowed to command the stage and confidence , as any grifter can tell you , is the irreplaceable basis of a successful con game give them what they want , sings the preternaturally dapper lawrence jameson \( mr lithgow \) in the show s opening number , of his vocation as a swindler of stinkingrich women in a riviera resort what the public wanted four years ago was the producers , mel brooks s blockbuster adaptation of his own movie about dirty dealings on broadway the glare cast by the producers was so bright that another , more modest but eminently likable musical was thrust into the shadows the show was the full monty , a sweetnatured tale of unemployed men who find their dignity in becoming strippers for a night , and its creators saw the brassier producers wipe the floor with it at the tony awards and at the box office now much of the same creative team director \( mr o'brien \) , songwriter \( david yazbek \) and choreographer \( jerry mitchell \) have returned with the mission of really giving broadway audiences what they want this time the problem is that none of these truly gifted folks and let me extend that description to embrace mr lithgow and sherie rene scott , who plays the pigeon waiting to be plucked are in their natural element in dirty rotten scoundrels , adapted from the 1988 movie starring michael caine and steve martin mr o'brien , whose credits range improbably from the current hairspray to the spectacular lincoln center production of henry iv in 2003 , may well be the american stage s most protean director these days but whether dealing with fat men in housecoats , shakespearean barflies or clothesshucking middleaged schlemiels , mr o'brien has always exuded a kindly courtesy toward the characters in his shows the same glow emanated from mr yazbek s score for the fully monty in songs that found a charming pop lyricism in bluecollar malaise with dirty rotten scoundrels , which has a book by jeffrey lane , mr o'brien and mr yazbek seem to be saying ok , world , you want showbiz razzledazzle \? we can do that you want shameless \? we 'll give you that , too so out come the ribald puns the scatological and sex jokes the undulating , overdressed chorus lines and a hardsell title song underlined in brass at the same time , the show respectfully follows the formulas of the goldenage book musical , right down to a comic romantic subplot for two eccentric supporting characters \( gregory jbara , trapped in a french accent , as a crooked police chief and joanna gleason as a swinging american divorc e in a wardrobe of spoof status clothes designed by gregg barnes \) and like the producers , it pauses now and again for selfconscious winks at progenitors like my fair lady and oklahoma ! what s missing is the galvanizing , hypnotizing energy that might make you forget that these ingredients appear to have been assembled according to an oftchecked shopping list for a borrowed recipe there is equally little evidence of the one thing that no successful double con act can do without , chemistry between its two perpetrators in this case , that means mr lithgow s rakish lawrence and mr butz s freddy , a happy vulgarian in search of some class chemistry was n't a problem in frank oz s film of 17 years ago , which traded on its audience s existing awareness of the star personae of mr caine \( suave , deadpan , devilish \) and mr martin \( antic , goofy , outrageous \) though he won a tony playing a nastier kind of smoothie in sweet smell of success , the illfated musical of 2002 , mr lithgow is most comfortable looking perplexed and deferential onstage , as he did in the drama m butterfly \( for the record , he can be a firstrate movie villain \) with a wavy coif and outlined eyes that give him the epicene look of a 1920 s movie idol , mr lithgow gamely preens and postures as the vain , guileful lawrence , the crook deluxe of the french seaside gambling town of beaumontsurmer \( as designed by david rockwell , the town bears a beenthere resemblance to the riviera landscape in the current revival of la cage aux folles \) but you can feel the strain behind mr lithgow s performance , especially when he has to be extravagantly wicked or daring though he does fine by a rex harrisonstyle patter number , he is most at home in a wistful , wispy ballad lawrence sings in the second act a quality of eager impersonation also infuses the performance of ms scott \( of the original broadway cast of aida \) as christine colgate , the ostensibly sweet and klutzy target of the show s central scam \( a bombshell blonde with a big voice , she s a gladiola pretending to be a shrinking violet \) but mr butz , who singlehandedly made the unfortunate thou shalt not bearable a few years back , is definitely the real thing the possessor of a puckish face and a buddha belly , mr butz also has the ability to switch on at will a vocal and comic power that jolts an audience to attention dirty rotten scoundrels most noticeably comes to life with freddy s selfintroductory number , great big stuff , an inspired parody of the hiphop odes to the materialism of music videos great big stuff elicits mr yazbek s sophisticated knack , much needed on broadway , for both satirizing and exploiting top40 musical sensibilities it s a skill that is also gleefully evident in a syrupy secondact duet for freddy and christine that brings to mind those tonsilstretching romantic movie theme songs from the 1980 s and the show s climactic number , its title song , is aggressively catchy enough to bring down the house there is also an unbearably shrill hoedown number performed by sara gettelfinger as an heiress from oklahoma otherwise , mr yazbek s score brings to mind the sort of 1960 s pop melodies of henry mancini \( especially those written for caper flicks \) and burt bacharach that live on translated into elevator music they are tunes that simmer softly in the background , which is not what this kind of musical requires the lyrics , also by mr yazbek , drop a lot of brand names and are cheerfully , clunkily cheesy \( if music be the food of love , he ate my smorgasbord , sings ms gleason , whose delivery throughout is so deadpan as to verge on posthumous \) this tone is , it should be noted , of a piece with the carefully structured script by mr lane , who appears to be under obligation to keep the corn flying as if it were tornado season in kansas in august \( her people are in oil crude \? well , she is a little pushy \) summing up his friend and rival freddy in the play s final scene , lawrence observes , what you lack in grace , you certainly make up for in vulgarity these would appear to be words to live by for the creators of dirty rotten scoundrels but the show just does n't have the selfbelief , not to mention the oomph , that can make vulgarity a fine art 'dirty rotten scoundrels' book by jeffrey lane music and lyrics by david yazbek , based on the film dirty rotten scoundrels written by dale launer and stanley shapiro and paul henning directed by jack o'brien choreographed by jerry mitchell musical direction and incidental music arrangements by ted sperling sets by david rockwell costumes by gregg barnes lighting by kenneth posner sound by acme sound partners associate choreographer , denis jones orchestrations , harold wheeler vocal music arrangements , mr sperling and mr yazbek dance music arrangements , zane mark conductor , fred lassen music coordinator , howard joines executive producers , marty bell aldo scrofani presented by mr bell , david brown , mr scrofani , roy furman , dede harris , amanda lipitz , greg smith , ruth hendel , chase mishkin , barry and susan tatelman , debra black , sharon karmazin , joyce schweickert , bernie abrams michael speyer , barbara whitman , weissberger theater group jay harris , cheryl wiesenfeld jean cheever , clear channel entertainment and harvey weinstein , in association with mgm on stage darcie denkert and dean stolber at the imperial theater , 249 west 45th street , manhattan , \( 212 \) 2396200 running time 2 hours 35 minutes with john lithgow \( lawrence jameson \) , norbert leo butz \( freddy \) , joanna gleason \( muriel eubanks \) , gregory jbara \( andr \) , sara gettelfinger \( jolene oakes \) and sherie rene scott \( christine colgate \)
tv antennas were beginning to sprout on rooftops like spindly metallic weeds , the alternateside parking minuet was just being choreographed and air raid sirens still rumbled daily at noon in 1955 when new yorkers paused briefly to contemplate a city strained almost to bursting after the tensest quarter century in its history titled our changing city , a 20part series of articles in the new york times painted a largely optimistic panorama of the century s second half it envisioned a sprawling cultural center and fordham campus on the squalid west side , a civic plaza in downtown brooklyn that robert moses promised would rival the piazza san marco in venice , a grand development over the sunnyside railroad yards in queens , and a palace of progress devoted to world trade atop a reconstructed pennsylvania station a second avenue subway would replace the elevated rail line that still loomed over third avenue there would be a harlem on the upswing , a prosperous period of shipbuilding at the brooklyn navy yard , racially integrated public housing projects and evidence that coney island was fast trading in its storied glitter for genuine glamour there were caveats , of course , to the theme that things were generally changing for the better the critic lewis mumford predicted permanent gridlock the new coliseum in columbus circle threatened the existence of the storied madison square garden the proliferation of office buildings on fifth avenue heralded the indian summer of its era of fashionable department stores the deteriorating west side was hiding morosely behind city soot times square never got off its knees after the depression darkened its theaters sordid slums endured , awaiting their day in the light new yorkers feared water shortages , what was quaintly called delinquency and the cold war reality that their city was a prime target for attack but planners' greatest concern was that the nation s biggest city , a sprawling 319squaremile metropolis that still counted 268 commercial farms on 1 , 451 acres , was simply running out of room to grow the city finds herself , in midcentury , almost at the end of her land resources , wrote meyer berger of the times cautioning that similar dire warnings had been sounded before , one article predicted nonetheless that with only 31 , 000 acres of unused residential space remaining , the end now seems not too far somewhere around 1975 , or , at most optimistic measures , the year 2000 new york is a very different city from the one that times reporters dissected in 1955 the main constant has been change the promise of lincoln center was fulfilled the promising futures of penn station , coney island and the sunnyside yards were not nor were the fears about fifth avenue some changes were unexpected times square was reborn globalization lured a record number of immigrants , but also contributed to an exodus of factory jobs belying those gloomy forecasts that the urban frontier in new york was on the verge of closing forever today , according to city planners , only about 7 , 639 of the 11 , 533 acres defined as available vacant land nearly half the total is in staten island is zoned for residential use but other variables , in 1955 and in 2005 , render those raw numbers almost moot it was true 50 years ago and it is true today that there is not a meaningful amount of vacant land on which to build new housing , said brad lander , director of pratt institute s center for community development , but there are all sorts of other ways in which to build since 1950 , according to the census , the city s population dipped and has now risen by at least 100 , 000 the number of homes and apartments has expanded by nearly 800 , 000 , but so far the city has n't reached the end of its land resources why has n't the end come \? said eric kober , director of housing , economic and infrastructure planning for the city s department of city planning land gets recycled over the next few decades , coop city was developed on the site of a failed amusement park in the bronx , and roosevelt island was transformed from derelict hospital buildings to highrise housing in queens , north shore towers , near the nassau border , supplanted a golf course , and housing replaced a gravel quarry in douglaston tenements that flanked the second and third avenue elevated lines in manhattan gave way to highrise apartments , and garment factories and printing plants in soho were turned into luxury lofts two acres in fresh meadows , queens , the only vestige of the last privately owned , commercial working farm in the city , once a 200acre spread , were finally sold to a developer in 2003 for 43 million in long island city , hailed in 1955 as having the greatest concentration of light industry in the nation , furniture and food are still manufactured but a third residential tower is rising on the east river what s displacing long island city manufacturing is less lower wages overseas than it is real estate prices , mr lander said the sunnyside yards are among the large places still available for development , though , as are the west side railyards in manhattan to accommodate more housing , city planners have rezoned fallow manufacturing sites and also parts of some neighborhoods in which only nonresidential development or less density were permitted they are under pressure to redraw the zoning maps even more a study this year for the manhattan institute , a conservative research group , said the city had space for 500 , 000 more factory jobs than actually exist and estimated that rezoning underused factory sites could accommodate 86 , 200 homes and apartments about 27 percent of the city s 153 , 734 acres are occupied by one and twofamily houses , more than any other category of land use , and slightly more than the amount of preserved open space manufacturing accounts for about 4 percent and vacant land for 75 percent a halfcentury ago , nearly 29 percent of new yorkers were employed in manufacturing , more than in any other industry classification today , only about 8 percent are since 1950 , the number of doctors has gone up by about threequarters , the number of real estate agents has nearly doubled , the number of designers and social workers has more than quadrupled and the number of hospital workers has increased 13fold there are more parking attendants , security guards , auto mechanics and cabbies , about the same numbers of carpenters and shoemakers , but fewer television repairmen , dentists and sailors the census found 28 , 884 elevator operators , 2 , 235 telegraph messengers , 624 blacksmiths and 372 private household laundresses living in the city in 1950 , but none today fifty years ago , the brooklyn piers handled half the cargo that passed through the port of new york today , they account for less than 5 percent , with the bulk now in new jersey some 33 million vehicles crossed the george washington bridge in 1955 last year , 108 million did homeownership increased , to just over 30 percent of all houses or apartments , up from 19 percent the proportion of residents living in buildings with 50 or more apartments has increased substantially the suburbs swelled , none as much as suffolk county , which ballooned to about 15 million residents from 380 , 000 as rural enclaves developed into suburbs , providing an outlet for new yorkers and allowing the city to absorb newcomers
the united food and commercial workers union called on walmart stores yesterday to release all documents connected with accusations that its former vice chairman , tom coughlin , had obtained improper expense account reimbursements to finance secret antiunion activities the union s call for release of the materials comes two weeks after mr coughlin resigned , accused by walmart , the world s largest retailer , of taking 100 , 000 to 500 , 000 through expense account abuses the company , based in bentonville , ark , said it had turned the matter over to the united states attorney for the western district of arkansas for criminal investigation the union voiced dismay over a report in the wall street journal yesterday that cited several walmart employees who said that mr coughlin diverted thousands of dollars in expense account reimbursements as part of a plan to make secret payment to union staff members so they would tell walmart officials the names of prounion employees at stores we are deeply disturbed by these allegations , said bill mcdonough , the union s director of organizing these are serious criminal offenses and cast walmart s systematic antiworker activities on a much more sinister level walmart should not try and cover up its activities but should do the right thing and make all of the documents public immediately walmart executives said they knew nothing about such a plan and that the company had not cooperated in any arrangement to funnel money to improper antiunion efforts we reported the unsupported assertion about payments to union representatives to the us attorney when we made our initial report of misappropriated corporate funds , said mona williams , walmart s vice president for corporate communications neither mr coughlin nor anyone else at walmart was ever authorized by the company to make payments to anyone for information about union activity ms williams said a company investigation had found no evidence supporting accusations of money being funneled to illegal antiunion activities instead , she said , the money was misappropriated for the personal benefit of specific individuals greg denier , a union spokesman , said the union did not know of any officials who had accepted payoffs from mr coughlin to inform on prounion employees he said he would be shocked if any staffers had accepted such payments federal law prohibits companies or their managers from paying money to union officials to help derail organizing drives the food and commercial workers have sought to unionize dozens of walmart stores , but have failed to organize any workers except for those in the meat department of one store in jacksonville , tex that was five years ago , and a few weeks after the organizing drive succeeded , walmart , with a reputation for fiercely fighting unions , announced that it was phasing out its meatcutting operations at its stores in many states and would start using prepackaged meat instead the wall street journal reported that mr coughlin , long viewed as a prot g of sam walton , the company s founder , had faked invoices over more than five years to receive reimbursements for among other things , hunting vacations , a 1 , 359 pair of custommade alligator boots and a 2 , 590 dog pen for his arkansas home in a statement , mr coughlin s lawyers , william w taylor iii and blair g brown , said mr coughlin did not seek nor obtain any improper reimbursements from walmart we are unable to respond further to allegations concerning expense reimbursement without seeing the records walmart has refused to provide them to mr coughlin the lawyers said it was unfair for walmart not to provide mr coughlin , who had once been in the running for chief executive , with the documents after he had worked for the company for 27 years william cromwell , first assistant united states attorney for western arkansas , declined to comment on the accusations against mr coughlin the coughlin resignation is part of a continuing string of embarrassments for walmart last month it reached an 11 million settlement with the federal government over the use of illegal immigrants to clean its stores in january , it reached a 135 , 540 settlement with the labor department over allegations that it violated child labor laws in three states by letting minors use dangerous equipment this week , walmart held its first conference for journalists in an effort to burnish the company s image lawrence jackson , an executive vice president , said walmart had repeatedly told its managers and employees to comply with the law we have people who feel pressure , who do the wrong thing , whether it s a vice chairman or whether it s the first person on the floor , and none of it has ever been condoned , mr jackson said we make sure that we tell people to do the right thing and not the expedient thing at the conference , walmart s chief executive , h lee scott jr , commented about mr coughlin s departure saying , it s an extraordinarily difficult issue for the company because of tom s tenure with the company and the status he held

it would be neat and tidy to say that the knitting factory is safe for jazz again that the oncelittle club has gone back to its nice old menschy ways after having gone through a relocation to posh tribeca , pretentiously inflated internet and worldwide franchising business ventures , street protests staged by musicians angry at its practices , trying months during the rebuilding of ground zero , a smoking ban , a few years of rock 'n' roll , and many torturous chairs and unworkable toilets \( it still has unworkable toilets \) and that the nyc winter jazzfest , a sevenhour , threestage , 19band event it held on sunday night , was the welcoming signal of jazz s return but the knitting factory s relationship to jazz was always an interrogatory one the club formed its identity around the new york improvisers of the late 1980 s , many of whom felt uncomfortable with jazz as a set of traditional aesthetic values they jostled and shook jazz to express how much it meant to them , and the club had the great idea , during its high years , of booking the rebels as well as the traditionalists if the knitting factory is to book jazz again and be true to its own history , it will have to provoke a little confusion , mixing up audiences for double bills , nurturing the notion of a homegrown jazz avantgarde and then brazenly selling out to pop stars , confusing the issue of jazz s current identity perhaps it will do just that six months ago the club added a fourth booker , brice rosenbloom , to bring back some of its old heritage and his bookings for sunday s marathon showed that he grasps the club s jazz past as well as its possible jazz future this was not a selfcelebrating , thisisourlife evening for the club , which opened in 1986 in a houston street storefront and moved to leonard street in 1994 and it was n't meant to be winter jazzfest was occasioned by the association for performing arts presenters conference as a kind of trade show for outoftown producers and promoters to hear recently established talents all at once \( it was similar in its purpose to global fest , the worldmusic show held the night before at the public theater \) the event opened up to the public , though , for a 25 cover charge , and about 650 people packed the club s three rooms curiously , there was no outandout free jazz , and none of the club s old fixtures like wayne horvitz , john zorn and bill frisell the most established performers were the saxophonist james carter and the trumpeter dave douglas mr carter played a goodnatured , rocking performance with his organ trio , and mr douglas opined about the return of real music to the room before playing a tight , fastmoving set with his quintet , featuring a new saxophonist for the band , the virtuosic donny mccaslin many bands across the long evening reflected one big obsession bringing the rhythms of popular music , and especially of dance music , into jazz in the bad plus , there was the bearish drummer dave king , using thin drumsticks to intimate the needling rhythms of electronic dance music between wandering patches of free rhythm in the 12member band burnt sugar , led by the guitarist vernon reid , and the quintet blackout , led by the vibraphonist stefon harris , there was whomping , oldschool funk \( but at times terreon gully , the drummer from blackout , switched over to the

for clogs , a halfclassical quartet with guitar , bassoon , violin and percussion but the pianist jason moran , one of jazz s greatest new artists , gave perhaps the best lesson about jazz it is what jazz musicians do with his group bandwagon , mr moran used his slot to prove that he s basically fixated on his own imperatives folding traditional blues structures into his beguiling new music \( and adding the guitarist marvin sewell to see them through \) , he flirted with compositional tools that could eclipse his own instead the music turned out stubborn and almost perversely personal , with a

the argument over social security privatization is n't about rival views on how to secure the program s future even the administration admits that private accounts would do nothing to help the system s finances it s a debate about what kind of society america should be and it s a debate republicans appear to be losing , because the public does n't share their view that it s a good idea to expose middleclass families , whose lives have become steadily riskier over the past few decades , to even more risk as soon as voters started to realize that private accounts would replace traditional social security benefits , not add to them , support for privatization collapsed but the republicans' loss may not be the democrats' gain , for two reasons one is that some democrats , in the name of centrism , echo republican talking points the other is that claims to be defending average families ring hollow when you defer to corporate interests on votes that matter let s start with the case of the bogus 600 billion in his jan 15 radio address , president bush made a startling claim according to the social security trustees , waiting just one year adds 600 billion to the cost of fixing social security the 600 billion cost of each year s delay has become a standard administration talking point , repeated by countless conservative pundits who have apparently not looked at what the trustees actually said in fact , the trustees never said that waiting a year to fix social security costs 600 billion mr bush was grossly misrepresenting the meaning of a technical discussion of accounting issues \( it s on page 58 of the 2004 trustees' report \) , which has nothing to do with the cost of delaying changes in the retirement program the same type of infinite horizon calculation applied to the bush tax cuts says that their costs rise by 1 trillion a year that s not a useful measure of the cost of not repealing those cuts immediately so anyone who repeats the 600 billion line is helping to spread a lie that s why it was disturbing to read a news report about the deputy commissioner of the social security administration , who must know better , doing just that at a proprivatization rally but in his latest radio address , mr bush correctly , this time attributed the 600 billion figure to a democrat leader he was referring to senator joseph lieberman , who , for some reason , repeated the party line the republican party line the previous sunday my guess is that mr lieberman thought he was being centrist and bipartisan , reaching out to republicans by showing that he shares their concerns at a time when the democrats can say , without exaggeration , that their opponents are making a dishonest case for policies that will increase the risks facing families , mr lieberman gave the administration cover by endorsing its fake numbers the push to privatize social security will probably fail all the same but such attempts at accommodation may limit the democrats' political gain meanwhile , the party missed a big opportunity to make its case against increasing families' risk by acquiescing to the credit card industry s demand for harsher bankruptcy laws as it happens , mr lieberman stated clearly what was wrong with the bankruptcy bill it failed to close troubling loopholes that protect wealthy debtors , and yet it deals harshly with average americans facing unforeseen medical expenses or a sudden military deployment , making it unfair to working americans who find themselves in dire financial straits through no fault of their own a stand against the bill would have merged populism with patriotism , highlighting democrats' differences with republicans' vision of america but many democrats chose not to take that stand and mr lieberman was among them his vote against the bill was an empty gesture on the only vote that opponents of the bill had a chance of winning a motion to cut off further discussion he sided with the credit card companies to be fair , so did 13 other democrats but none of the others tried to have it both ways it is n't always bad politics to say things that are n't true and claim to support things you actually oppose just look at who s running the country but democrats who engage in these tactics right now create big problems for a party that has been given a special chance maybe its last chance to remind the country of what democrats stand for , and why oped columnist email krugman nytimescom
over the past 10 years , working for either modest compensation or none at all , john f o'mara , a littleknown lawyer from the upstate village of horseheads , has helped gov george e pataki draw up the death penalty , deregulate the energy industry and direct campaigns he has helped choose the state s most important judges , and he has negotiated the state s lucrative casino agreements with indian tribes but while serving as one of the governor s most trusted advisers , mr o'mara has also played another , more profitable role as one of the state s more potent lobbyists just a partial public accounting of his fees from last year shows that his companies made 570 , 000 trying to secure state contracts , or garner tax breaks or block legislation for clients mr o'mara is hardly the first pataki confidant to profit from access to the state s most powerful politician indeed , albany has never had clear boundaries between insider and outsider , and many pivotal players have long found ways to benefit from their government experience but few political figures have moved so boldly between the lines as mr o'mara , according to publicinterest groups that view lobbying loopholes as one of the state s most glaring shortcomings while several pataki aides have left government to lobby their former colleagues , mr o'mara has remained a highlevel pataki adviser and appointee while working simultaneously as a state lobbyist in recent years , when he served pro bono as the state s chief negotiator in the thorny matter of indian land claims , it was common to see him at the capitol , sweeping into the governor s office like a member of the senior staff it was impossible to tell from a distance whether he was there to counsel mr pataki on important matters of state , or to brief him on business vital to his clients , to speak with authority on behalf of the administration or on behalf of those who sought its favor last summer , mr o'mara s dual roles brushed against each other as he negotiated for the state with an indian tribe that sought to open a casino in rochester the negotiations sputtered , but not before the tribe s prime financial backer in the proposal , an upstate shopping mall developer , found himself face to face with mr o'mara , trying to hammer out a deal mr o'mara was , and had been for years , the hired lobbyist for the developer s largest competitor , though the developer says he did not realize this at the time while there are no indications that mr o'mara has violated any law or lobbying guideline , his activities have drawn criticism from those who seek a higher wall between lobbyists and public servants mr o'mara , who declined to be interviewed but agreed to answer written questions , said in two letters to the new york times that he has worked hard to avoid conflicts in a career of almost 50 years in the legal profession , he wrote , i have acted in accordance with the highest ethical standards critics of new york s lobbying laws , though , say his activities illustrate what is wrong with a system in which , they say , access has become a treasured commodity to do business in new york you have to pay a toll , said assemblyman richard l brodsky , a democrat from westchester , and that toll goes to one of the governor s inner circle the lobbying climate it can be difficult to track a lobbyist s activities and fees in new york unlike the practice in many other states and in new york city , lobbyists hired to secure state contracts do not need to report their efforts only lobbyists for clients who seek to influence state legislation or rules must register with state monitors you really do n't know what o'mara is lobbying for because he often does n't have to register , said assemblyman william l parment , a democrat from jamestown who has been critical of the lobbying system mr o'mara said his lobbying is limited and , among his clients this year , only one does not need to register public filings with state lobbying regulators indicate that last year mr o'mara s companies earned 330 , 000 as the registered lobbyist for two clients one is a liquor distributor who is trying to block the sale of wine in supermarkets , and the other is a shopping mall developer who is seeking 630 million in state tax breaks in addition , he helped the first albany corporation , an investment bank , secure financing deals from several state agencies for a fee of 240 , 000 , an activity for which he did not have to register but that was disclosed in the company s securities industry filings nor did he have to register as a lobbyist for motorola , which paid him an undisclosed amount for help with its unsuccessful bid to win a 1 billion state wireless radio contract mr o'mara said he supports efforts to require disclosure of all lobbying efforts , including those involving state contracts but recent attempts to amend the lobbying laws have failed in 2003 , mr pataki did order state agencies and authorities to begin recording their contacts with lobbyists but the agencies do not track how much lobbyists are paid , and they do not distribute the information they collect critics say that lobbyists with access , like mr o'mara , draw clients even if they lose some of the time in the case of the radio contract , it was won by a client of former senator alfonse m d'amato , a lobbyist who enjoys his own entree with the pataki inner circle , and who sometimes works as a partner with mr o'mara mr o'mara usually lobbies under the banner of his elmira law firm , davidson o'mara but he represents two clients one lobbying and one not , he said under the name do consultants , a partnership he has with mr d'amato long before he met mr pataki , mr o'mara helped to coordinate campaigns and select federal judges for mr d'amato during his three terms in the senate they are good friends and their partnership lists its mailing address and phone number as the park avenue office from which mr d'amato directs his other lobbying business , park strategies adviser to the governor mr o'mara , grayhaired and 71 , carries himself with the quiet authority of a man who has been both a state judge and a district attorney he is widely viewed as one of the more powerful republicans in upstate new york , but he seldom draws attention to himself his two homes , a colonial on three acres outside elmira and a beach house on lake ontario , are far from the spotlight his decision several weeks ago to step down after finishing his work as the state s indian land claim negotiator hardly made a ripple , even though he was the primary architect for a sweeping settlement that may well bring five casinos to the catskills yet , since 1994 , when he played a role in mr pataki s first campaign for governor , mr o'mara has developed into his vital adviser , one who is often entrusted with important political and governmental tasks it was mr o'mara who was chosen by the governor to lead the deregulation of the state s energy industry as chairman of the state s public service commission in the late 1990 s and when federal authorities investigated allegations that members of the pataki campaign had promised parole favors for campaign contributions , mr o'mara helped the campaign coordinate payments to lawyers for those staff members who were questioned in accepting the governor s land claim post , mr o'mara took on a dispute over the ownership of former indian lands that had defied resolution for decades , one with a potentially tremendous impact on new york s development as well as the bank accounts of all who would gain casino rights in thanking mr o'mara for his six years of work last month , mr pataki said the fact that we stand at the threshold of resolving each of the major indian land claims in new york state is a testament and credit to his leadership for years , the governor has also asked mr o'mara to direct panels that recommend candidates for federal appointment and help pick the judges for the court of appeals , the state s highest court he s probably had more positions than anyone since bob moses , said assemblyman parment james m mcguire , a state supreme court justice in queens and mr pataki s former counsel , said mr o'mara , an established name in albany , did not need pataki appointments to bolster his lobbying clout does anybody really think that john o'mara really needed to spend all those hours on indian land claims just to get more lobbying clients \? he asked mr pataki , who did not respond to a request for an interview for this article , has also appointed two of mr o'mara s children to state jobs thomas , to serve a year in 1999 as chemung county district attorney , which paid 119 , 000 , and ellen , to a sevenyear post as a 68 , 000ayear commissioner of the workers' compensation board last year , when thomas o'mara ran successfully for the assembly , the governor lent his name as host to a 1 , 000ahead manhattan fundraiser that drew several dozen business leaders to an event for the fledgling chemung county candidate the party , at a park avenue office building , only reinforced the image that mr o'mara travels in circles where the political , the social and the commercial routinely intersect it was held in a banquet space in the building , which is owned by peter s kalikow , a friend of mr d'amato s whom the governor made the chairman of the metropolitan transportation authority mr o'mara and mr d'amato have both lobbied the agency they also house their lobbying business in the same building , upstairs in mr d'amato s 25thfloor office just down the hall from mr kalikow s own four months after the event , campaign filings indicate , no one had reimbursed mr kalikow for the party event organizers said the bill from mr kalikow had been misplaced and would soon be paid assemblyman brodsky and others contend there is a certain clubbiness to lobbying in albany that gives rise to the perception that it has increasingly become an insider s game , open to only a few bradford race , mr pataki s former chief of staff , disputed that view , asserting that the governor has never been shy about saying no , even to a close adviser like mr o'mara we said no a hell of a lot more than we said yes , mr race said in answer to questions for this article , mr o'mara wrote that he has been careful to avoid conflicts by seeking guidance from the state s ethics commission governors , he said , have long taken advice from people who have had unrelated business with the state he cited a 1996 opinion by the commission that , ruling in the case of another state appointee , said a person who lobbies the governor is not necessarily prohibited from also serving the governor in an appointed role the work , mr o'mara said in a feb 11 letter , which i did as a negotiator for the state in the lawsuits involving indian land claims is unrelated to and involves a completely different matter having no connection to the limited lobbying which i have done a casino proposal in one instance , though , mr o'mara s lobbying pursuits and his work on behalf of the state intersected it happened last year in the debate over whether new york should allow an indian tribe , the senecacayugas , to build a casino in rochester during the negotiations with mr o'mara , the senecacayugas , now based in oklahoma , considered dropping their claim to ancestral lands in new york in exchange for gambling rights at a 500 million las vegasstyle complex many tribes have pursued claims that land was wrongfully taken from them by the state , and the financial damages from the lawsuits threaten to be staggering the senecacayugas , for example , have already been awarded part of a 247 million judgment over the long term , though , many tribes believe gambling profits will exceed the oneshot revenues from a land claim in the case of a senecacayuga casino , mr o'mara s negotiating team offered the tribe the exclusive rights to run video lottery terminals in the area around rochester in exchange for a percentage of the proceeds , according to a june 8 letter to the tribe later that day , however , the state sent another letter , making it clear that the rights may not be entirely exclusive the letter carved out a potential exception for the rochester fast ferry , which was seeking state permission to put lottery terminals on its highspeed boats , which ran between rochester and toronto if the ferry received state permission , the letter indicated , the tribe would still have to pay the state for the exclusive rights , even though it was no longer the only local gambling operator the ferry company had a powerful patron shepherding its gambling bid mr d'amato , who had been hired for 10 , 000 a month to represent it thus , while the tribe was negotiating with mr o'mara as a representative of the state , his sometime lobbying partner was pursuing the gambling interests of a potential competitor without the exception , mr d'amato s client might have been locked out of the local gambling business the state would have already promised the tribe exclusivity mr o'mara , who said he did not know of mr d'amato s role , said the exception was necessary to protect the state s share of the casino revenues in the event the legislature passed the ferry bill anyway ultimately , both the ferry s bid for gambling and the casino concept faltered the ferry s bid stalled in the assembly , and the company , citing high operating costs , suspended service several months ago the ferry company s founder , dominick delucia , who contributed 2 , 000 last year to the political campaign of mr o'mara s son , did not respond to requests for comment mr o'mara said neither he nor his son had solicited the contribution mr d'amato said he had no idea the ferry had arisen in the casino negotiations prospects for the casino in rochester have also faded , because of local opposition had the talks continued , though , mr o'mara might have faced an awkward situation the tribe s chief financial backer on the proposal , thomas wilmot , is also a leading opponent of the domed syracuse mall being proposed by one of mr o'mara s largest lobbying clients , pyramid management in fact , mr wilmot has spent more than 300 , 000 on his own lobbyists who have sought , among other things , to block people like mr o'mara from getting pyramid the 630 million in state tax breaks it seeks vincent martin bonventre , an albany law school professor who is an expert in legal ethics , said multiple roles can present unenviable choices ultimately you get to a point where you have to choose , he said are my interests going to be what s best for pyramid , or what s best for the state \? lawyers and lobbyists should never try to put themselves in that position mr o'mara said he did not believe his business relationships with pyramid or mr d'amato had created any conflicts i do not believe there was a conflict with respect to mr wilmot , mr o'mara wrote in a feb 17 letter , and if he did he never suggested in any manner that such was the case mr wilmot said he did not learn until after the negotiations had faltered that mr o'mara also represented his competitor as a lobbyist , but said he had been treated fairly he did not , for example , view gaming on the ferry as a threat to his casino plan , he said a representative of the senecacayuga tribe , scott wood , said he knew mr o'mara represented pyramid as well as the state , but said the tribe was not concerned our inside sources , mr wood said , told us that judge o'mara was a man of character and that he had been given the assignment by the governor , and that he was someone who could set any concerns aside and do his job and i have always found him in his meetings to be very honest and forthright the tribe is now seeking to build a casino , not in rochester , but in the catskills , one of the five proposed mr wilmot , who has not been mentioned in connection with that plan , said he is still trying to become part of one of the deals lobbying

williamstown , mass the achievement of the french painter jacqueslouis david lies just beyond the pale of modernism we know that the artist , whose late work is the subject of a compact and revelatory exhibition at the sterling and francine clark art institute here , is indisputably great his oath of the horatii , painted in 1784 and exhibited to almost universal acclaim in the salon of 1785 , is a veritable cornerstone of neoclassicism it announced the triumphant return of the grand tradition of poussinian history painting , and answered the prayers of critics who had been fulminating against the decadence of court painting for years , with boucher as main scapegoat it gave visual form to the ideas of the french revolution before the fact and imbued the events of greek history with an emotional and spatial immediacy that poussin never imagined in the darkened lectures of western art 101 , when the oath pops up on the screen after the frothy bouchers and watteaus , you take notice against an arched setting so plain and lucid as to be almost protominimalist , its impossibly buff , synchronized warriorbrothers reach toward the handful of swords that their father thrusts aloft , their resolute virility enhanced by a huddle of hysterical women and children still , david s achievement is hard to keep in focus it is too complex , resistant , intimidatingly versatile , politically slippery and enmeshed in history it comes at us in bits and pieces the horatii pledging their lives brutus in his grief as the lictors carry in his dead sons madame recamier sitting on her chaise like a mermaid on a sarcophagus napoleon crowning josephine amid enough imperial splendor and extras to satisfy cecil b demille the sabine women courageously calling timeout in battle various mythological lovers like cupid and psyche in their porcelain embraces and there are the portraits , the best of which convey a sense of scrutiny and stillness that would be equaled only by photography in every mode , the images are fueled by the same sure knowledge of anatomy , tuned to real or ideal , a sense of smooth polished skin that may have been new to painting yet with all the movement between fact and myth , past and present and propaganda and reportage , it is almost a relief to let david get lost in the shuffle of the great , universally adored , more manageable 19thcentury french painters who followed him , starting with his student ingres then came delacroix and g ricault , whose roiling raft of the medusa heralded the downfall of neoclassicism and the onset of romanticism , realism and modernity david quickly became the 19thcentury s b te noire , the personification of the academy that courbet and manet challenged and the impressionists and postimpressionists largely ignored born in paris in 1748 into a family that included master masons and architects , david entered the french academy at age 17 but had a slow start it took nearly a decade and five tries to win the prix de rome \( after his second loss , he attempted suicide by starvation for two days \) four more years of struggle followed in rome before he found his style the saving grace , mere months before his return to paris , was a trip to naples in 1779 , where he saw the antiquities at herculaneum and pompeii he later wrote that the experience was like having surgery for cataracts it is possible that no artist except rubens was more politically active , but even rubens did not have to negotiate one of the most tumultuous , fastmoving and treacherous periods in history somehow , david had the ambition and the savvy to keep his boat not only afloat but somewhere near the head of the fleet elected as a deputy to the national convention , he voted for the execution of louis xvi in 1793 he was a confidant of danton and robespierre during their reign of terror during this period he organized revolutionary festivals and painted his starkest , perhaps greatest painting , marat assassinated he then served a year in prison after the fall of the jacobins and under napoleon , david was named first painter , although he had to be asked twice \( he sensibly turned down the offer of such a courtly position while the little corporal was still first consul of the ostensibly republican directory \) in 1815 , after waterloo and napoleon s second abdication , the game was up the last act was exile in brussels , where he died in 1825 at 77 perhaps it is not surprising that relative to the attention lavished on monet and company a certain art historical neglect ensued the first monographs on david in english did not appear until 1980 jacqueslouis david empire to exile , the clark s show , is the first major exhibition of his work in the united states it is not big or complete in any sense almost none of the paintings mentioned above are included \( the louvre , which owns the most important davids , rarely lends even those that are small enough to be moved \) but this is a thoroughly wonderful show including 26 paintings and 22 drawings , it has been organized in collaboration with the j paul getty museum , where it was seen earlier this year , and overseen by philippe bordes , who teaches at the university of lyons2 the focus on late work obviates the need for the oath , or other examples of the early history paintings , including the met s death of socrates the absence of so many of the usual masterpieces means the exhibition emphasizes the david who is slightly outside history and , you could say , more within painting the assembled works concentrate on portraits , sprinkled with depictions of napoleon , some mythological scenes and a surprising group of blackcrayon drawings done in brussels the accessories and hairdos are greek , but the thickened features and grieving expression recall his early admiration for michelangelo by the show s conclusion , you probably wo n't miss the big louvrelocked napoleonic warhorses , even thought they fall within the exhibition s scope \( several of these works are present in color reproductions that dominate most of the show s third gallery the display includes enormous images that seem to reproduce a narrow strip of each painting at a gargantuan scale they suggest a dangerously offtheleash graphic designer , until you find out that these portions are actual size \) all told , the exhibition provides a rare and riveting view of a great , innovative painter whose inordinately complex life and striving personality play out in his work to a remarkable degree you ca n't spend five minutes in the show before realizing that one of its accomplishments is to destabilize any notion of neoclassicism , romanticism and realism as separate entities , at least as applied to the second half of david s career it also makes clear that he never completely severed his ties to the work of the muchmaligned boucher , whose art he grew up adoring this may explain , for example , the beautiful wetonwet tendrils of the mane and tail of the manic rearing steed in the impossibly heroic image of napoleon crossing the alps \( 18001 \) and the locks are only the most overtly gorgeous part of this sparkling image , in which napoleon s cape , blowing beside him like a great wing or a cantilevered crag almost as solid as the surrounding rock but napoleon actually made the trip on a mule , and david seems to hint at the impossibility of his portrayal in the deft indications of tiny soldiers trudging along in the background , sometimes climbing nearly vertical cliffs the show is a panoply of changing subjects , techniques and degrees of finish the subtle painterliness of the surface of the napoleon stands in marked distinction to the pristine smoothness of its neighbor , sappho , phaon and cupid from the state hermitage museum , where all parties disconcertingly look out at the viewer while sappho , her alabaster arms raised toward cupid , swoons at the touch of phaon neither work prepares you for the thinly scumbled surface of david s selfportrait from the louvre , painted in 1794 in prison dressed in subdued browns against a brushy brown background reminiscent of goya \( who was almost his exact contemporary \) , david presents himself as a simple painter , palette and brushes in hand , as if denying allegiance to all but art then the high gloss returns again , in the emperor napoleon in his study at the tuileries , which shows the ruler looking slightly foppish , the napoleonic code on his desk , the candles burnt low , the clock reading 4 10 in the morning the portraits and their differences hold the attention longest here the high finish and carefully choreographed settings for napoleon contrast with the plainness of the commissioned portrait of the wealthy irish quaker cooper penrose , a study in black , white and gray painted in david s studio in the louvre it could be a pendant to whistler s portrait of his mother the portraits of his family have an ineffable tenderness , especially one of his wife , who has the face of an irish barmaid but is dressed in white satin as fine as that clothing the beautiful countess daru , whose portrait is on loan from the frick collection the final gallery is devoted to portraits that david painted in brussels all of them depict fellow refugees from napoleon s court , including a striking double portrait of the emperor s nieces , z na de and charlotte bonaparte the sisters , seated on a couch of red velvet embroidered with the imperial bee motif , are interrupted while reading a letter from their father , joseph , who had fled to new jersey they look toward us , one bold , one timid , their personalities delicately and profoundly differentiated it has been said that nadar s photograpic portraits were presaged by ingres s painted ones , but the distinction belongs to david , who expanded his understanding of the human body , gleaned from antique sculpture , to encompass the human psyche and became the first painter of modern life jacqueslouis david empire to exile is at the sterling and francine clark art institute , 225

baghdad , iraq , dec 9 the priests have long since departed , but the elite jesuit high school called baghdad college still looms over the swirling world of iraqi politics the three iraqi political leaders considered most likely to end up as prime minister after nationwide elections this week ayad allawi , ahmad chalabi and adel abdul mahdi were schoolmates at the allboys englishlanguage school in the late 1950 s , fortunate members of the baghdad elite that governed iraq until successive waves of revolution and terror swept it away now , with most of saddam hussein s interlopers locked up and the iraqis preparing to select a fullterm parliament , the boys of baghdad college , now men in their 60 s back from exile , are ready to assume their place on top of the social hierarchy that they and their families once assumed would be theirs forever the three men are now flag bearers for three very different visions of iraq s future mr allawi for a secular state , mr mahdi for an islamicstyle democracy , and mr chalabi for a program that would purge iraqi society of those associated with mr hussein s rule hard feelings have erupted at times , in particular between mr allawi and mr chalabi , who struggled bitterly in the 1990 s over the leadership of the iraqi exile movement but what unites the three former schoolmates could prove more important than what sets them apart clashing banners and personal ambitions aside , mr allawi , mr chalabi and mr mahdi say they are ready to strike political deals that might involve tossing aside some ideological differences mr mahdi and mr chalabi say they aim to form a national unity government with iraq s main political leaders , presumably including mr allawi mr allawi , among others , says that is highly unlikely even so , the ties that go back to childhood and to the musty corridors of baghdad college suggest that the hard clashes that lie ahead in this polarized land may yet be softened by three men who grew up together ahmad was a year ahead of me , and we used to go swimming together , mr allawi said adel and i were friends , our families knew each other he was a good basketball player politically we are very different now , he said but those were nice days then indeed , many of iraq s most prominent political leaders are linked by a network of social and familial connections that dates back generations and was largely displaced after the revolution of 1958 and the rise of mr hussein s tribalbased rule a cousin of mr allawi s father , for instance , is married to mr chalabi s sister mr chalabi s father , a president of the iraqi senate during the hashemite monarchy , was a colleague of mr mahdi s father , who was minister of education the father of adnan pachachi , himself a former foreign minister and now a parliamentary candidate in mr allawi s party , was a signatory of the first iraqi constitution with mr chalabi s grandfather baghdad college , established in 1931 , became the secondary school where the iraqi capital s most prominent families sent their sons earlier , many such families sent to their children to victoria college in alexandria , egypt mr pachachi , at 82 much older than the three possible candidates , graduated from there perhaps the most reliable guide to the pathways of the new iraqi politics is the baghdad college yearbooks from the 1950 s and early 1960 s , where old black and white photographs show smartly dressed boys , their faces aglow with the anticipation of success there , for example , is laith kubba , now a top aide to prime minister ibrahim aljafaari and there is kanan makiya , the author of a landmark book about the terror of mr hussein s rule and the founder of the iraq memory foundation , which is dedicated to memorializing its victims in the hashemite monarchy , when iraq was still largely governed by an oligarchy , many students arrived at baghdad college already knowing many of those around them people knew each other , even though they had not met , said harith alajil , a student at baghdad college in the 1950 s and now a candidate for parliament it was easy to communicate for men now in their 60 s mr allawi is 60 , mr chalabi is 61 and mr mahdi is 63 memories of that time are sometimes hazy and although the three men attended baghdad college at the same time , because of their differing ages they did not attend the same classes but the memories are fondly held during separate interviews last year , mr chalabi and mr mahdi volunteered that they had gone to high school together , and each man walked over to his bookcase to pull down his yearbook adel was always bullying us , mr chalabi joked about the softspoken mr mahdi , with whom he remains close ayad was taciturn mr allawi said he and mr chalabi used to swim after school at the alwiya club , an exclusive social club and he described how he and mr mahdi had become politicized at baghdad college , first with the fevers of arab nationalism and then with the early stirrings of the baath party mr allawi went on to become a hardline baathist enforcer , later breaking with mr hussein and surviving an assassination attempt in london mr mahdi embarked on an intellectual journey that took him from the baath party to maoism and finally to the moderate political islam he embraces today mr chalabi boasted that he had received the highest marks in school , a boast that was not disputed by mr allawi or mr mahdi i was ahead of chalabi , but he was so intelligent he was jumping classes , mr mahdi said mr allawi , mr chalabi and mr mahdi all spoke of the discipline of their jesuit priests , who ran strict classrooms and assigned hours of homework each evening the politicians , all three of whom are shiite , said they were never forced to pray or attend classes on catholicism the student body was then about half christian , but the jesuits' reputation for academic rigor attracted many of baghdad s prominent families but like so much else in iraq , the cloistered world of the jesuits was overrun by politics the 1958 coup and the baath party s rise ushered in a period of violence that has not ceased mr chalabi , his father then a government minister , left the school and iraq that year mr allawi and mr mahdi joined the baathist movement as young men but were eventually driven out of iraq as well mr allawi was severely wounded in an assassination attempt by an axwielding agent of mr hussein , while mr mahdi was arrested , tortured and jailed none of the three men graduated from baghdad college , though each later excelled in academia mr allawi went to medical school in baghdad mr chalabi earned a doctorate in mathematics from the university of chicago mr mahdi earned two master s degrees from universities in france in 1969 , the baathist government ordered the jesuit priests deported and nationalized baghdad college soon students were attending mandatory classes on the glories of mr hussein and the baath party uday and qusay , the dictator s sons , attended the school in the 1980 s , each of them terrorizing the students and staff while most other students came to class smartly dressed , the young qusay typically strode into class encased by a retinue of bodyguards with his shirt unbuttoned to the waist qusay was very stupid he got a 4 percent on one of his midterm examinations , said yacob yusef , the headmaster uday was smarter , mr yusef said sometimes the teachers would answer the questions for him in the 1980 s , omar altikriti , the son of barzan altikriti , one of mr hussein s top henchmen and now on trial in baghdad accused of mass killings , ran in an election for the students' representative to the faculty when omar received only two votes , his bodyguards attacked the winning student , leaving him paralyzed , mr yusef said today , baghdad college is becoming more its old self the mandatory classes on mr hussein are gone the boys who enter are still among the best in the city there is even talk of the jesuits returning as for politics , mr allawi , mr chalabi and mr mahdi say that while the furies engulfing their country are serious , the best hope for containing them may lie in three old schoolmates sitting down together when you have known each other that long , mr chalabi said , it takes the edge off the tension
the sexual molesting case against michael jackson , which could put him in jail for 18 years , rests almost entirely on the confused and sometimes contradictory testimony of three siblings , none older than 18 at the same time , defense lawyers for mr jackson face a delicate balancing act in crossexamining the young witnesses challenging them too vigorously could turn the jury against the defense team and mr jackson , who has promoted himself for years as loving children and all things childlike while the accuser and his siblings appear to be resolute on central aspects of the case , the halting manner of their presentation and the defense team s aggressive efforts to undermine them illustrate the difficulties in putting children on the witness stand and having their testimony stick mr jackson s accuser , who was 13 when prosecutors say the abuse occurred two years ago at the singer s ranch , testified for an hour on wednesday and all day thursday for the most part , he was composed and poised but his memory failed him on several crucial points , and on others he contradicted his own grand jury testimony and the trial testimony of his younger brother and their sister , who testified earlier on thursday , under friendly questioning from the chief prosecutor , thomas w sneddon jr , the accuser described an occasion when mr jackson showed up naked and sexually aroused while the boy and his brother were on mr jackson s bed the accuser gave the grand jury that account last year , and his brother repeated it in court this week the accuser told the grand jury that mr jackson had told the boys his condition was natural and that he had discussed masturbation with them but on thursday , the accuser testified that mr jackson had not said anything , and the boy made no mention of the singer s aroused state he then changed his testimony after mr sneddon showed him what he had told the grand jury in another inconsistency , the accuser s 14yearold brother said in court that he had twice witnessed mr jackson sexually abusing the older boy , only to claim later that there were actually three times thomas lyon , a law professor at the university of southern california and an expert on child abuse , said that inconsistencies in testimony were common in molesting cases he said that children in such cases can mesh repeated events together the more they see something similar but somewhat different over time , it becomes blended in their memory , professor lyon said a child , he said , might be talking about lots of different events , and we do n't know how much he s seen , and it s natural that it appears inconsistent in testimony either way , professor lyon said , the defense s job is to hammer on details any witness could have trouble with child witnesses , he said , tend to have more difficulty than adults in explaining inconsistencies the task for defense lawyers is made more complicated by human predisposition to sympathize with children the defense has to walk a fine line between aggressively going after the inconsistencies and bullying the child , professor lyon said but , he added , once the child starts to crack a bit , the defense can be pretty aggressive robert weisberg , a professor of law and head of the center for criminal justice at stanford university , said defense lawyers can discredit child witnesses without grilling them it has to be done with kid gloves so it never appears to be attacking the witness , he said otherwise , he said , a cross examination could cause the jury to take a dim view of the defendant under crossexamination on thursday by thomas a mesereau jr , mr jackson s chief defense lawyer , the accuser s composure appeared to fade he became argumentative and seemed unsure of his answers mr mesereau began to pick apart the narrative the boy had offered to mr sneddon , and the boy showed uncertainty about the events that led up to the alleged molesting the boy is to return to the stand on monday ronald richards , a criminal defense lawyer from beverly hills who has been observing the trial , said the boy was obviously very coached but when the boy was pressed under questioning , mr richards said , it exposed one of the dangers of putting a child , even a wellprepared teenager , on the stand the witness was obviously eager to say what he 'd been trained or coached to say in his extensive debriefings with prosecutors , mr richards said the defense immediately grabbed the witness by the neck and brought him back to reality all three siblings denied they were trained for their court appearances they were clearly embarrassed over the subject matter , and spelled out unsavory words rather than saying them the three have also been reluctant to admit that their father beat them years ago the younger brother told investigators at one point that the beatings had not occurred at all that s a classic case of an abused child not wanting to disclose embarrassing information , professor lyon said such reluctance tends to be more pronounced when describing homosexual molesting , he said , because teenage boys are often highly aware of sexual identity issues the boy did not testify on friday , when the session was dedicated to motions from lawyers prosecutors sought to obtain detailed financial information about mr jackson , saying that he is in debt by as much as 400 million and on the precipice of bankruptcy prosecutors contend that mr jackson saw his career and his financial empire crumbling as a result of a broadcast documentary in which he admitted sharing his bed with boys and that he took extreme measures , including a conspiracy to kidnap and imprison the family of the accuser , to contain the damage judge rodney s melville said he would limit evidence of mr jackson s finances i do n't think you can turn the jury into accountants , he said the judge also said that the comedian jay leno , who is expected to be a witness in the trial , can make jokes about mr jackson if he avoids the facts of his testimony , which is expected to concern a call he received from the boy s mother judge melville refused a defense request to have jurors visit mr jackson s neverland ranch the judge said the jury was seeing enough of the ranch through videotapes i 've never seen so many videotapes , he said , and i'm sure i have n't seen the end of them

shakespeare the biography by peter ackroyd illustrated 572 pp nan a talese doubleday 3250 a year in the life of william shakespeare 1599 by james shapiro illustrated 394 pp harpercollins publishers 2795 time was when we knew little about the life of shakespeare like the good victorian he was , tennyson exulted the less you know about a man s life , the better i thank god day and night that we know nothing about shakespeare like the true skeptic he was , mark twain jeered that writing a biography of shakespeare was like reconstructing a brontosaurus skeleton from nine bones and 600 barrels of plaster of paris this last comes from history play , an amusing fantasy life of christopher marlowe by rodney bolt , who ridicules a typical shakespeare biographer all references in the plays to dolphins are lined up to suggest that , maybe , as a boy shakespeare traveled 12 miles to see a water pageant staged by the earl of leicester in his castle grounds at kenilworth and so , bolt continues , a story is stitched together well , yes , a shakespearean biography requires stitching , but some people are handier than others with the needle the two books under review here are both sartorial successes shakespeare the biography , by peter ackroyd , is longitudinal it tackles the entire life , with just enough about the ancestors and a brief look at the afterlife a year in the life of william shakespeare , by james shapiro , is latitudinal , focusing on 1599 , in some ways shakespeare s annus mirabilis it addresses in detail the four plays and background events of that year , but with a good many flashbacks and flashforwards both approaches have their merits ackroyd s are preponderantly those of a fellow writer and literary historian , with savvy observations from the heights of hindsight shapiro s are largely those we associate with a cultural critic and political journalist in full immersion needless to say , there is a good deal of overlapping , as there must be , but nobody who has read the one will fail to find pleasure and profit in the other by now research and criticism have shed so much light on shakespeare that anyone interested enough to read these books knows the broad outlines of his life childhood and schooling in stratford in a household probably hiding condemned roman catholicism under a protestant facade marriage at 18 to the 26yearold anne hathaway and the births of three children the socalled lost years , during which will may have worked for a butcher \( unlikely \) or tutored in the homes of lancashire nobility \( more likely \) the coming to london as actor , playwright and poet , involved in the rivalries among various acting companies and competition with fellow playwrights perhaps also something about the mainly good relations with two monarchs , elizabeth and james , and with certain prominent noblemen finally , the retirement to stratford and life as a wealthy landowner , only sporadically punctuated by collaboration with other dramatists ah , but the particulars ! elusive about everything , from the way the man looked \( all portraits are dubious , and all different \) to the spelling of his name \( more than 80 ways \) , from his religion \( protestant \? catholic \? none \? \) to his sexuality \( hetero \? homo \? bi \? \) , from the dating of his works to the exact instances and extent of his collaborations , from what roles he may have enacted to his relationships with family and friends also the precise nature of his general learning and specific reading annoyingly \( though typical for the period \) , not a single letter or diary entry of his exists for some time now , what i 'd call shakelit has been a major industry books and articles about every conceivable and inconceivable aspect of shakespeare are pouring out by the thousands it seems unlikely that major factual discoveries remain to be made , but even asyetunsurmised surmises are becoming fewer and often sillier obviously , a new book about shakespeare must take off from available historical and critical material , which by now , as the ackroyd and shapiro bibliographies attest \( the latter alone runs to 40 pages \) , could easily fill a tidy volume but when even the experts cannot have read everything , what is a mere book reviewer to do \? how is he to know exactly what in these books has been documented or speculated before , and how much is new insight \? just as the spectator or reader of the plays can ignore shakespeare s borrowings , so one may best consider these books fully their authors' own as for claims for alien authorship of the plays , neither ackroyd nor shapiro wastes much ink on them personally , i hail the anonymous student who stated , shakespeare s plays were written by william shakespeare or another man of that name ackroyd , though not a professional shakespeare scholar , is a novelist , poet , critic and , above all , prolific biographer , with books on chaucer , thomas more , blake , dickens , pound and t s eliot , some of whom he aptly brings in here comparisons with dickens , who was , in a way , the shakespeare of the novel , are particularly suggestive but ackroyd , fruitfully , quotes many foreign opinions , old and new , as well especially effective is the brevity of his chapters , each dealing with a specific matter , and with a title slyly drawn from shakespeare s words that the endnotes are purely bibliographical , and everything else is right in the text , is also laudable praiseworthy , too , is that ackroyd , unlike shapiro , does not modernize spelling , heterodox as this was in shakespeare s day any standardization or modernization of shakespeare s language , ackroyd writes , robs it of half its strength a shadow is not as dim and veiled as a shaddowwe , ' a cuckoo does not sing like a 'kuckow , ' and music is not as enchanting as 'musique' in the old language we can still hear shakespeare talking ackroyd expertly evokes the townscape and landscape in and around stratford , and the corresponding mindscape that vividly merges the urban and the rustic take the 108 plant varieties and 60 species of birds mentioned in the plays , evidencing a country background and as england was changing from medieval to early modern , there emerged a disparity between polite and popular traditions shakespeare was perhaps the last english dramatist to reconcile the two cultures ackroyd is full of the firsts and lasts , the leasts and mosts that shakespeare evinced if there is a governing idea in shakespeare the biography , it is to demystify the man and the artist to show him as part of a continuum originating in the medieval miracle , morality and mystery plays also as a hardheaded , practical man of the theater and , later , of business as a diligent worker who steadily polished and revised his writings , and who saw all sides of an issue with uncanny impartiality already in school , pupils were taught to exercise their memories and argue both sides of an issue so does one learn to remember much and use it without prejudice how different from the old home was life in turbulent london , whose very stench penetrated some 25 miles on all sides with emanations of dung and offal and human labor but will thrived in a city where dramatic spectacle became the primary means of understanding reality his famous all the world s a stage was in fact a renaissance commonplace not without some justice , urban life was imagined as distinguished by sex and disease , and the new playhouses , much persecuted by the authorities , as harboring both it was a world where kisses on the mouth were the common salutation between men and women , who bared their breasts in public , and where respected playhouse owners also owned brothels nearby shakespeare , often thought of as quiet , gentle , modest and retiring , is revealed by ackroyd as shrewd , energetic and stubbornly persevering most of the era s playwrights were oxford or cambridge graduates shakespeare was the first to emerge from the ranks of the actors it may be that from the mercurial relationships within the various companies he was successively part of he derived his greatest and earliest gift , the commingling of comedy and tragedy he was not a liberal his respect is for the power of even weak rulers the common people are invariably the rabble significant events stem from human will , not divine providence rapidly though he was gaining theatrical prominence , his most reprinted work was the long erotic poem venus and adonis although he is the most salacious of all the elizabethan dramatists , ackroyd says , his is also the most profound treatment of love in the english language erotic literature , ackroyd argues , reveals an author s personal tastes , and that poem about overpowering lust for a young male is considerably more passionate even than thomas mann s 'death in venice' yet this does not imply that he was in any sense homosexual but suggests , rather , an unfixed or floating sexual identity this may tie in with what ackroyd calls extraordinary theatrical impersonality it is not a matter of determining where shakespeare s sympathies lie aristocracy versus populace but of recognizing that shakespeare had no sympathies at all we may at times feel too much novelistic license , as when ackroyd finds no reason to believe that shakespeare was deeply disturbed by the death of desdemona but at other times his writerly approach gives him an advantage , as when he notes , of antony and cleopatra , how the billowing rhetoric of the egyptians contrasted with the high roman rhetoric of time and duty it is the oration conceived as poem or again , of the extensive revision and rewriting of king lear , that shakespeare was always a work in progress this is not to deny that james shapiro writes good , clean prose that can stand up to ackroyd s for example , he tells about the jigs , semiimprovisational oneact plays that incongruously followed the conclusions of plays because elizabethan audiences demanded it jigs anarchic and libidinal were wildly popular because they tapped into parts of everyday experience usually left untouched in the world of the play as such , they provided a counterpoint to the fragile closure of romantic comedy and to the high seriousness and finality of tragedy by picking 1599 as his subject , shapiro gets to zero in on four plays that marked shakespeare s path to complete mastery henry v , the last and most interesting of the history plays , succeeds and frustrates because it consistently refuses to adopt a single voice or point of view about military adventurism past and present the present was the earl of essex s hapless campaign against the irish rebel tyrone , which affected shakespeare s thinking so much that in act v , scene 2 , the queen of france greets henry as brother ireland shapiro writes , the mistake is not the nervous queen s but shakespeare s , who slipped when intending to write 'brother england' \( and whose error modern editors silently correct \) the next play , julius caesar , is a transition from history play to tragedy , and reflects the uneasy times when elizabeth s reign was threatened by irish rebels and catholic plotters , not to mention rumors of another spanish armada shakespeare is so good at juxtaposing competing political arguments , balancing them so neatly , that four centuries later critics continue to debate whether he sides with or against brutus and his fellow conspirators the end of the republic and the coming of empire is one of those epochal moments that always challenged shakespeare to imagine what it means to live in the bewildering space between familiar past and murky future another transformation occupied him in as you like it , from the forest of arden of his boyish dreams to what had become mostly enclosed pastures for sheepherders that is the subtext as the comedy shuttles between four scenes in the dream forest and twelve in the pastures , showing two worlds in conflict in a background that at times casts a shadow over an otherwise relatively sunny comedy its quiet recognition of the threat of social dislocation seems to anticipate the next play shakespeare set in england , 'king lear' a similarly troubling shadow is cast over england by the tragic history of essex and elizabeth , which shapiro keeps aptly running parallel to shakespeare s growth , climaxing in hamlet analyzing its two versions in brilliant detail including the influence of sermons and a new genre , the essay the book reaches its own climax even as it traces , with the downfall of essex , the end of chivalry what arises instead is the east india company , started by a rising bourgeoisie , which eventually subsumed even the marginalized aristocrats it is this new mercantile capitalist class that greatly contributed to the making of the british empire and the modern age shapiro does a fine job showing how this historic change gave birth to hamlet , with its inwardness and psychologizing , and to the row of great tragedies that followed i disagree with his negative reading of fortinbras and undervaluation of troilus and cressida , but this entire final section of the book deserves close reading and careful reflection here , then , are two books that in their diverse ways make similarly worthy contributions to shakespeare studies while , regrettably , having also a lesser feature in common a certain sloppiness of diction i cite only select examples ackroyd , the distinguished british author , writes comprised of , central protagonists , wracked for tortured and beaumont s and fletcher s \( not to mention references to sartre s play les mains sales as a novel and to the poet heinrich heine as the german philosopher \) shapiro , the noted columbia english professor , writes neither lives nor history come sliced , wart , whom even falstaff admits is unfit , any soldier could be hung , disinterested for uninterested , every male were required and transpired for happened could their love of shakespeare elicit a desire to return us to his

seattle in the spring of 1977 , some friends and i made a 40mile pilgrimage to the biggest and fanciest movie theater in iowa so we could watch a new science fiction movie called star wars expecting long lines , we got there early , and found the place deserted as we sat on the sidewalk waiting for the box office to open , others like us drifted in from the towns , farms and colleges of central iowa and queued up behind when the curtain in front of the big cinerama screen finally parted , the fanfare sounded and the famous opening crawl appeared against a backdrop of stars , there were still some empty seats star wars was n't famous yet the only people who had heard about it were what are now called geeks twentyeight years later , the vast corpus of star wars movies , novels , games and merchandise still has much to say about geeks and also about a society that loves them , hates them and depends upon them in the opening sequence of the new star wars movie , episode iii revenge of the sith , two jedi knights fight their way through an enemy starship to rescue a hostage ever since i saw the movie , i have been annoying friends with a trivia question who is the enemy \? what organization owns this vessel \? we ought to know in 1977 , we all knew who owned the death star \( the empire \) and who owned the millennium falcon \( han solo \) but when i ask my question about the new film , everyone reacts in the same way with a sudden intake of breath and a sideways dart of the eyes , followed by lengthy cogitation some confess that they have no idea others think out loud for a while , developing and rejecting various theories only a few have come up with the right answer one hyperverbal friend was able to spit it out because he had read and memorized the opening crawl another , a hardcore science fiction fan , had been boning up on supplemental materials clone wars , an animated tv series consisting of epic adventures that bridge the story arc between 'episode ii attack of the clones' and 'episode iii revenge of the sith ' if you have watched these cartoons or if you 've enjoyed some of the halfdozen clone wars novels , flipped through the graphic novels , read the short stories or played the video game you will know that the battle cruiser in question is owned by the new droid army of the confederacy of independent systems , which is backed by the trade federation , a commercial guild that is peeved about taxation of trade routes and that is not the only aspect of episode iii that you will see in a different light if you watch the movie without doing the prep work , general grievous who is supposed to be one of the most formidable bad guys in the entire star wars cycle will seem like something that just fell out of a happy meal likewise , many have been underwhelmed by the performance of hayden christensen , who plays anakin skywalker darth vader only if you 've seen the clone wars cartoons will you understand that anakin is a seriously damaged veteran , a poster child for posttraumatic stress disorder but since none of that background is actually supplied by the episode iii script , mr christensen has been given an impossible acting task he s trying to swim in air in sum , very little of the new film makes sense , taken as a freestanding narrative what s interesting about this is how little it matters millions of people are happily spending their money to watch a movie they do n't understand what gives \? modern english has given us two terms we need to explain this phenomenon geeking out and vegging out to geek out on something means to immerse yourself in its details to an extent that is distinctly abnormal and to have a good time doing it to veg out , by contrast , means to enter a passive state and allow sounds and images to wash over you without troubling yourself too much about what it all means in corporatespeak , there is a related term used when someone has committed the faux pas of geeking out during a meeting let s take this offline , someone will suggest , when the powerpoint slides grow dark with words literally , it means , i look forward to geeking out on this topic later but really it s a polite synonym for shut up already ! the first star wars movie 28 years ago was distinguished by healthy interplay between veg and geek scenes in the climactic sequence , where rebel fighters attacked the death star , we repeatedly cut away from the dogfights and strafing runs the purest kind of veggingout material to hushed command bunkers where people stood around pondering computer displays , geeking out on the strategic progress of the battle all such content as well as the long , beautiful , uncluttered shots of desert , sky , jungle and mountain that filled the early episodes was banished in the first of the prequels \( episode i the phantom menace , 1999 \) in the 16 years that separated it from the initial trilogy , a new universe of ancillary media had come into existence these had made it possible to take the geek material offline so that the movies could consist of pure , uncut vegout content , steeped in daycarecenter ambience these newer films do n't even pretend to tell the whole story they are akin to powerpoint presentations that summarize the main bullet points from a much more comprehensive body of work developed by and for a geek subculture concentrate on the moment feel , do n't think trust your instincts , says a jedi to the young anakin in episode i , immediately before a pod race in which anakin is likely to get killed it is distinctly odd counsel coming from a member of the jedi order , the geekiest people in the universe they have beards and ponytails , they dress in army blankets , they are expert fighter pilots , they build their own laser swords from scratch and \( as is made clear in the clone wars novels \) the masses and the elites both claim to admire them , but actually fear and loathe them because they hate being dependent upon their powers anakin wins that race by repairing his crippled racer in an ecstasy of switchflipping that looks about as intuitive as starting up a nuclear submarine clearly the boy is destined to be adopted into the jedi order , where he will develop his geek talents not by studying calculus but by meditating a lot and learning to trust his feelings i lap this stuff up along with millions , maybe billions , of others why \? because every single one of us is as dependent on science and technology and , by extension , on the geeks who make it work as a patient in intensive care yet we much prefer to think otherwise scientists and technologists have the same uneasy status in our society as the jedi in the galactic republic they are scorned by the cultural left and the cultural right , and young people avoid science and math classes in hordes the tedious particulars of keeping ourselves alive , comfortable and free are being taken offline to countries where people are happy to sweat the details , as long as we have some foreign exchange left to send their way nothing is more seductive than to think that we , like the jedi , could be masters of the most advanced technologies while living simple lives to have a geek standard of living and spend our copious leisure time vegging out if the star wars movies are remembered a century from now , it 'll be because they are such exact parables for this state of affairs young people in other countries will watch them in classrooms as an answer to the question whatever became of that big rich country that used to buy the stuff we make \? the answer it went the way of the old republic oped contributor neal stephenson is the author , most recently , of the system of the world , the last book of the baroque cycle trilogy

descent the heroic discovery of the abyss by brad matsen illustrated 286 pages pantheon books 25 on the afternoon of sept 22 , 1932 , nbc preempted its regular radio programming for a special live broadcast it came , the announcer intoned , from a new world hitherto unknown to man , the deep ocean off bermuda , where two very cramped explorers , william beebe and otis barton , were suspended in a caststeel ball called a bathysphere the sea is boiling with lights and i can make out jet black comets , beebe reported at 1 , 950 feet he had already spoken of strange , illuminated fish swimming in waters as black as hades with beebe continuing to speak into the nbc microphone and the light show exploding around him , the bathysphere descended to 2 , 200 feet , shattering the record of 365 feet set by a navy submarine the sensational exploits of beebe , barton and the bathysphere kept americans on the edge of their seats in the 1930 s , and , as brad matsen proves in descent , they can still deliver a thrill the fact that the two heroes of the story could not stand each other only adds piquancy to the tale the two men made an odd couple beebe was a celebrity scientist with a taste for adventure at the new york zoological society , where he ran the department of tropical research , he was prized for his ability to raise money from rich patrons and attract publicity , primarily through the popular magazine articles he wrote about his expeditions a wideeyed enthusiast , he was , mr matsen writes , basically a grownup boy scout who always traveled with a copy of alice in wonderland and winnie the pooh barton , an engineering student at columbia university , idolized beebe obsessed with underwater exploration , he drew up plans for a sphere that , suspended from a steel cable , would take two passengers as far as a halfmile under the surface of the ocean family money allowed him to finance the vessel , which he offered to beebe , provided that he be allowed to travel along the offer was too good to turn down together , beebe and barton would squeeze into the bathysphere and make nearly 20 descents into the waters off bermuda , grabbing page 1 headlines along the way and , in 1934 , descending to a recordbreaking 3 , 027 feet mr matsen , the author of fishing up north and planet ocean , struggles with his material he does not know how to construct a narrative or set a scene he gets bogged down in technical details , names too many names and loses himself in unnecessary digressions on , for example , the linnaean system of classification or the early history of underwater photography inexplicably , he dramatizes the nbc broadcast through the eyes , or the ears , of the renaud family in bridgeport , conn , gathered in their living room around the radio mr renaud is an accountant at a meatpacking plant , and why he enters the story remains a much deeper mystery than the twinkling fish described by beebe the story , in other words , lurches along in fits and starts but mr matsen pulls himself together for the bathysphere descents , which are hard to beat for stomachchurning tension , and he vividly evokes the strange underwater universe visible through the bathysphere s sixinch quartz windows beebe and barton , after wiggling through a 14inch hatch , arranged themselves in a steel chamber only four and a half feet across , a tight fit for one man but agony for two sheer terror served as a distraction from the physical discomfort a small , undetected crack in one of the windows or a leak around one of the hatch bolts would mean sudden death , although not by drowning because of the extreme pressure , mr matsen writes , the first molecules of water entering the sphere would fly through their bodies like highpowered rifle bullets suffocation was an everpresent danger and it was not hard to imagine the bathysphere coming loose from its cable the payoff lay just outside , in the wonderland illuminated by a single beam mr matsen describes this undersea universe beautifully the large , dark forms hovering just past the edge of the darkness that reminded beebe of wolves lurking beyond a campfire light the bomblike flashes of light given off by clouds of shrimp repelling a predator the underslung jaw and needlelike teeth of the weird , barracudalike fish that beebe named bathysphaera intacta at 800 feet , with the light turned off for a moment , a world of inky blueness returned in which constellations as bright as stars in a prairie sky formed and disappeared constantly if the public loved it , scientists remained cool some accused beebe of halfinventing his remarkable fish in a particularly cruel dig , a reviewer of beebe s book half mile down suggested that the author s overeager panting had fogged the bathysphere s window , producing the distorted images familiar to this day from the national geographic illustrations by else bostelmann \( none of beebe s fish have since been seen \) like bob hope and bing crosby , the two heroes of the bathysphere fell out almost immediately barton hated being treated as a sidekick by the press and chafed at being excluded from beebe s inner circle of attractive female assistants and wealthy patrons beebe could not tolerate barton s moodiness and lack of pep it was , perhaps , a turning point when a seasick barton vomited in the bathysphere at the beginning of the nbc dive oh god , otis , beebe groaned not now barton went on to make an unsuccessful underwater film , titans of the deep , denounced by beebe beebe s half mile down became a best seller and the bathysphere \? after languishing in a storage yard under the cyclone on coney island for the last decade , it is being readied for public display by the new york aquarium in june

trenton , july 3 when richard j codey s 14 months as new jersey acting governor come to an end in january , it will be difficult to find a more revealing snapshot of his tenure than the 279 billion budget he maneuvered through the legislature during the wee hours on saturday mr codey , who was unexpectedly thrust into the role of acting governor last year after gov james e mcgreevey resigned from his scandalmarred term , promised to restore a sense of restraint to state government and his budget does manage to reduce the state s reliance on fiscal gimmickry while holding spending virtually unchanged the most notable bigticket items in the budget reflect mr codey s longtime commitment to public funding for health care spending for a cancer center , stem cell research and increased aid to the mentally ill above all , the budget negotiations offer an illuminating example of the management style that mr codey , a career legislator , has brought to the job of the state s chief executive by alternately using bluffs , charm , threats , sheer political muscle and compromise , mr codey was able to broker a deal that will allow him to claim the mantle of fiscal responsibility without actually taking the kind of drastic austerity measures that might incite a backlash against those democratic lawmakers who face reelection this year it s clear that dick codey as chief executive was muted by dick codey the legislator , said david p rebovich , a political science professor at rider university legislators typically think in terms of incremental change rather than pursuing comprehensive reforms it comes as little surprise that mr codey managed to dominate the process because he had an immense amount of power to work with he holds two of the three most powerful positions in trenton acting governor and senate president and the third , speaker of the general assembly , is held by a fellow democrat the only real drama in the elongated battle came between mr codey and those fellow democrats who are up for election this fall democrats in the assembly facing reelection were worried that mr codey s proposal to raise taxes on cable television and eliminate the popular property tax rebate program might doom them at the polls senator jon s corzine , whose wealth persuaded mr codey not to challenge him for the democratic nomination for governor , also had a stake in the process because republicans have been unrelenting in blaming him for the democrats' troubles in trenton mr codey essentially split the difference with his fellow democrats he agreed to drop the cable tax and restore full property tax rebates for the elderly , but homeowners younger than 65 will see the average rebate drop to 350 from 800 republicans , none of whom voted for the budget , were quick to criticize the reduced property tax rebates and point out that despite mr codey s talk of belttightening , he still used half a billion dollars in onetime revenue sources and managed to include tens of millions in pet projects for fellow democrats this is n't going to go away , said assemblyman guy gregg of morris county this is walking into a campaign jon corzine is going to have to respond to this mr corzine and democrats in the assembly were just as quick to praise the budget and remind voters that when republicans last controlled state government , in 2000 , acting gov donald t difrancesco pushed through a budget that included huge increases in borrowing and spending assemblywoman bonnie watson coleman accused republican legislators of being opportunists during this year s negotiations she said they focused on property tax rebates without explaining how the state could avoid cuts in school aid , health care funding and assistance to the poor if the gop s plan were real , it would result in 9 billion worth of cuts to scores of vital services , said assemblywoman coleman , the state democratic chairwoman while republicans , democrats in the assembly and mr corzine will battle over the property tax issue until election day , mr codey can rest assured that his legacy as acting governor will include his efforts to move the state toward a more fiscally prudent footing if he remains senate president , as expected , he will have additional influence because this year s budget negotiations were a rout of the assembly majority leader , the democrat joseph j roberts jr of camden , who had vowed to preserve the property tax rebates he can also point out just how drastically he changed the party s rhetoric about borrowing and spending just last year , mr mcgreevey s budget included a 17 percent increase in spending and paid for property tax rebates using a 19 billion borrowing scheme that the state supreme court said it would not permit in the future one democrat in the assembly even suggested that the party deserved praise for having the courage to spend mr codey s moves toward fiscal responsibility did not meet all of the lofty promises he made when he unveiled his spending plan early this year , but even many republicans concede that he made some progress and after 30 years in trenton , mr codey is savvy enough to know that in politics , a little bit of progress is all that is necessary for an elected official to claim a whole lot of credit so when the budget agreement was reached , mr codey was not shy about characterizing its significance with this budget , he proclaimed , the era of spending like there s no tomorrow ends right now
executives from symantec and veritas software have been scrambling this week to persuade investors that their proposed 135 billion deal , the largest in the software industry , makes sense but the share price of symantec has continued to slide since word emerged on dec 14 that the company was in talks to acquire veritas , making the sales pitch for the transaction , an allstock deal , even more of a challenge investors' apparent lack of confidence in the deal , which is expected to close in the second quarter , has prompted analysts to speculate that a rival bidder may swoop in with a counteroffer for veritas hewlettpackard , computer associates and emc , a top veritas competitor , have all been identified as possible suitors , although none of those companies have stated any interest in veritas shares of symantec have fallen 29 percent since dec 13 the stock price took a big hit yesterday , after microsoft announced that it was entering symantec s core market for antivirus software symantec closed down 186 , or 74 percent , at 2318 shares of veritas fell 190 , or nearly 7 percent , to 2556 a penny lower than the price before the merger talks were disclosed in a series of presentations to investors this week , symantec executives seemed perplexed by market reaction to the deal john w thompson , symantec s chief executive , said at wednesday s presentation that he was concerned that investors completely discounted the growth rates of the combined new company i do n't understand the haircut we got , he said i just do n't understand it symantec estimates that the merged company will grow 18 percent a year , a rate that mr thompson described as the fastest of any software company with at least 3 billion in revenue yet symantec investors have grown accustomed to even better currently , symantec is enjoying 35 percent annual growth , compared with veritas s growth of 10 percent but mr thompson noted that a consensus of analysts had forecast that symantec s growth rate would slow to 18 percent in the 2006 fiscal year , which starts in april the combined entity , he said , ends up with a growth rate that s equal to the consensus view of the street , and it s much , much stronger than any of the software industry s other large players some analysts say the planned merger indicates that symantec is worried about maintaining its growth those concerns over growth came to the fore yesterday with the announcement by microsoft while microsoft s arrival came as no surprise , the reality of having to compete with a giant had a sobering effect on symantec investors , said gene munster , an analyst with piper jaffray microsoft will initially offer both antivirus software and a spyware program free , followed by fullerfeatured commercial versions shares of mcafee , another leading antivirus software company and symantec s chief rival , dropped more than 5 percent yesterday after microsoft s announcement mcafee fell in december when microsoft said it had acquired a security software company , the same day that symantec and veritas announced their merger plans still , mr thompson of symantec insisted that the acquisition of veritas was not a defensive move against any future weakness in sales of security software our consumer business has been very , very solid for the last three years , he said the skepticism over the deal stems from the fact that the two companies are not in the same part of the software market symantec , one of silicon valley s oldest companies , is the leading seller of security software for personal computers , with roughly half of its sales coming from antivirus software veritas sells lines of datastorage and data management products , helps companies organize their corporate information , archive it and manage it but executives of the two companies see a clear logic veritas makes corporate data accessible , while symantec makes that data secure , and corporate customers increasingly want to buy such technology from a single vendor the merger of symantec and veritas , they say , is simply further evidence of consolidation in an industry where customers prefer fewer suppliers , not more and the lack of overlap , the executives say , will make a combination easier , lead to fewer layoffs and result in less disruption to business the companies expect cost savings in the range of 100 million but mr munster of piper jaffray said that a merger of this size faced largescale integration obstacles and that those challenges were being played down by symantec management we 're a little less optimistic , he said , that the integration is going to be a smooth as the company wants us to believe perhaps the biggest problem for investors is that the companies have failed to provide specific information about the future of their products , said nitsan hargil , an analyst with friedman , billings , ramsey they 've given us surprisingly little , he said i was expecting that with symantec s stock down 20 percent , they 'd be giving more information to solidify the deal

washington , nov 30 as a lawyer in the reagan justice department , the supreme court nominee samuel a alito jr played an integral role in devising legal strategy to pare back the landmark abortion rights case roe v wade , documents disclosed wednesday show judge alito argued in a 1985 memorandum to the reagan administration s solicitor general that two pending supreme court cases were an opportunity to advance the goals of overruling roe v wade and , in the meantime , of mitigating its effects and in a strongly worded 17page legal analysis , he recommended advancing the administration s ultimate case against roe by defending state regulations requiring doctors to provide women seeking abortions with information about fetal development , the risks and unforeseeable detrimental effects of the procedure and the availability of adoption services or paternal child support although the information might cause emotional distress , anxiety , guilt and in some cases physical pain to the women , judge alito wrote , such results are part of the responsibility of moral choice , comparable to the feelings of a legislator voting on abortion legislation , a judge or juror pronouncing a sentence of death or imprisonment , or a military officer commanding a mission he knows will cost lives the memorandum substantiates recently disclosed statements judge alito made about his pride in contributing to the administration s efforts to end the constitutional right to abortion he made those statements in a reagan administration job application written a few months after the memorandum it also illustrates judge alito s personal passion in opposing abortion rights and the formative role he played in the administration s approach to the cases the reagan administration s solicitor general , charles fried , sent copies of judge alito s memorandum to several others in the justice department for discussion i need hardly say how sensitive this material is , and ask that it have no wider circulation , mr fried wrote on the cover sheet when the administration weighed in on one of the cases , thornburgh v american college of obstetricians and gynecologists , mr fried incorporated some of judge alito s arguments in the government s brief but where judge alito sought to avoid a frontal assault on roe v wade that he thought risked rejection , mr fried decided to take it on directly judge alito s name does not appear on the brief in an interview wednesday , mr fried said judge alito had helped write part of the brief , although not the parts directly criticizing roe in his analysis of the cases , judge alito called the courts' reasons for overturning the abortion regulations incredible , remarkable and extraordinary he suggested that many physicians , including those operating highvolume abortion clinics , have a financial interest in encouraging women to have abortions , and that such doctors were more worried about an irs agent investigating tax shelters than about criminal prosecution for an abortionrelated offense and in a threepage proposed introduction for a brief , he argued that what is clear is that so long as the court adheres to the several doctrines announced by roe v wade , the difficulties and conflicts illustrated by these cases will continue to recur coming as the supreme court heard its first abortion rights case in five years , the disclosure has assured that the subject will remain at the center of the debate over judge alito s nomination , in part because he would succeed justice sandra day o'connor , the swing vote in many such cases in addition to galvanizing the opposition of many liberal democrats , the memorandum ratchets up the pressure on the handful of republican senators who support abortion rights several , including senators susan collins and olympia j snowe , both of maine , and senator lincoln chafee , of rhode island , have said they will oppose a nominee committed to overturning roe v wade all three senators voted to confirm chief justice john g roberts jr none could be reached for comment judge alito , who sits on the united states court of appeals for the third circuit , has told senators that if confirmed to the supreme court he will weigh the value of upholding the abortion rights precedents even if he disagrees with the original decisions he has stopped short , however , of disclosing how he would vote but senate democrats said wednesday that the memorandum s arguments and language suggested that judge alito had prejudged the issues this new information heightens concern about judge alito s views regarding settled law' and his eagerness to engage in activism to change a law with which he disagrees , senator patrick j leahy of vermont , the ranking democrat on the judiciary committee , said in a statement but steve schmidt , a spokesman for the white house , said suggestions that the memorandum indicated how judge alito might rule from the bench cross the border into silly land judge alito wrote the memorandum as a lawyer giving tactical advice to his client , the reagan administration , mr schmidt said when interpreting precedent on the federal appeals court , he added , judge alito has voted in some cases to uphold and in others to strike down abortion restrictions when the thornburgh case reached the supreme court , mr schmidt noted , justice o'connor wrote a dissenting opinion that questioned the lowercourt decisions the majority opinion , written by justice harry blackmun , upheld them in a statement , senator arlen specter of pennsylvania , a republican supporter of abortion rights who is chairman of the judiciary committee , said he held out the possibility that subsequent precedents might have altered judge alito s views many times the supreme court has decided the issue , mr specter said , singling out the 1992 case of planned parenthood v casey but senator charles e schumer , a new york democrat on the judiciary committee , said , maybe at the hearings he can dispel this , but the more you learn the more he seems to have something of an agenda judge alito , for his part , turned in his answers wednesday to a senate judicial questionnaire in response to a query about judicial activism , judge alito argued that the supreme court had a special responsibility for selfquestioning because neither of the elected branches of government could provide a check on its role in interpreting the constitution judges must be appropriately modest in their estimation of their own abilities they must respect the judgments reached by their predecessors and they must be sensibly cautious about the scope of their decisions , judge alito wrote and judges should do all these things without shirking their duty to say what the law is and to carry out their proper role with energy and independence listing his memberships in clubs or organizations , judge alito wrote that recent disclosures reflected that in the mid1980 s he belonged to concerned alumni of princeton , a group that initially opposed the school s admission of women and later opposed its affirmative action policies but he added , i have no recollection of being a member , of attending meetings , or otherwise participating in the activities of the group judge alito also listed the cases from which he had recused himself during his 1990 hearings for confirmation to the third circuit , judge alito said he would recuse himself from any cases involving vanguard , a mutual fundcompany that held some of his investments in 2002 , judge alito sat in judgment of a case involving vanguard and stepped aside only after a party to the case objected democrats have questioned the lapse , which he called an accident he later sent senator specter a letter arguing that his initial pledge applied to only his first years on the court and noting that ethics guidelines did not require him to recuse himself his answers to his questionnaire , however , indicate that he continued to recuse himself from cases involving vanguard throughout his time on the court after reading judge alito s 1985 memorandum , democrats argued that the administration should disclose more documents from his work in the reagan administration solicitor general s office the bush administration has so far maintained that disclosing such documents would compromise the confidentiality of white house deliberations mr schmidt , the white house spokesman , said the administration was not changing that policy he said judge alito s memorandum that was disclosed wednesday had ended up in the files of other justice department officials and been transferred to the national archives during the clinton administration
beijing shortly after a sars crisis scared many people off the streets of this city , henry m paulson jr , the chief executive of goldman sachs , flew here for a quiet dinner on june 4 , 2003 , with two of china s most influential power brokers they worked out a remarkable deal , approved last year by president hu jintao , that marks a triumph for goldman the creation of a joint venture that gives the firm greater access than any other foreign investment bank to china s increasingly lucrative financial services market but to gain that access , goldman engaged in an unusual horse trade in exchange for making a 67 million donation to cover investor losses at a failed chinese brokerage firm , goldman won government approval to set up its own jointventure investment bank in beijing and to jumpstart the venture , goldman also agreed to lend 100 million to one of the men mr paulson met that evening at the marblecolumned noble court restaurant in the grand hyatt a 52yearold chinese banker named fang feng lei the goldman deal , which the company hopes will mean millions of dollars in profits in the coming years , offers a rare glimpse into the maneuvers that many foreign companies undertake to get a leg up in the roughandtumble race to establish business in china and like others before it , the joint venture was years in the making , involving frequent huddles with high communist party officials what was so unusual about the goldman deal is that a blueblood american firm was willing to pay 67 million to help the government dissolve an entirely unrelated stateowned enterprise , hainan securities , whose officials have been accused in lawsuits of embezzling millions of dollars from investor accounts why the chinese government chose hainan securities remains unclear but mr fang and another power broker at the dinner table that evening , wang qishan , the mayor of beijing , had ties in hainan province mr wang had been hainan s party secretary from 2002 to 2003 and mr fang had overseen a real estate investment with hainan securities in the mid90 s goldman officials declined to comment on any aspect of the hainan securities money or the jointventure loan , including what kind of collateral mr fang pledged to back the loan but there is no evidence that mr fang or mr wang was involved in fraud at hainan securities , or that goldman s donation money will benefit them in any way analysts say major investment banks like goldman are expecting a growing number of chinese companies to tap the capital markets and they expect increasingly wealthy chinese to start investing there s a lot of talk now about a dysfunctional stock market , said li jin , an assistant professor at harvard business school , but in the future china s capital markets will be huge carson wen , a hong kong securities lawyer , added everyone wants to be in china because it s a market that holds a lot of potential for the long term and goldman wants to be one of the first with control over their own venture until now , most foreign investment banks have largely taken chinese companies public in hong kong or new york , or married chinese companies with western counterparts goldman will have greater control over a venture that will be able to take companies public in china and sell shares directly to chinese investors a level of control that neither its rival morgan stanley nor any other foreign investment bank can yet claim goldman is paying an additional 30 million for its onethird stake in the joint venture , to be called goldman sachs gaohua securities , bringing the cost of its ticket to china to nearly 200 million and that just gets goldman a foot in the door it does not cover the cost of buying equipment , renting office space or hiring staff members most foreign investment banks operate profitably out of hong kong goldman already employs about 1 , 000 people there the new beijing investment bank , whose chairman will be mr fang , has not yet begun operations goldman s push into china comes a decade after morgan stanley and the china construction bank won government approval to form the nation s first joint venture investment bank , the china international capital corporation , or cicc the bank , which had a 35 million investment from morgan , ran into trouble almost immediately cultural clashes and disputes over who controlled the new company rattled morgan executives in the first few years in 1997 , for instance , when china mobile was preparing a 4 billion stock offering , cicc did not underwrite the deal with morgan stanley it worked with goldman sachs instead according to former bankers , an important player in pushing the deals to goldman was cicc s deputy chief executive , mr fang , who had sparred with morgan executives over how to operate in china for his role in the china mobile offering , mr fang earned a reputation as a visionary who knew how to move deals through the chinese bureaucracy he s a big deal maker , said cao yuanzheng , chief economist at bank of china international and a former colleague of mr fang this is n't like the us here in china , you have to know about reforms and stateowned companies you need a special guy and that s him early in 2000 , mr fang left cicc to join a rival stateowned bank morgan stanley , which operates out of hong kong with about 700 employees , mended relations with cicc since then , morgan stanley has bounced back with some huge initial public offerings of chinese companies in hong kong and new york , including a stateowned oil giant , sinopec , and china unicom and cicc , which operates independently but is 34 percent owned by morgan , has grown into a powerhouse , pulling ahead of both morgan and goldman with more than 18 billion in mainland equity deals in the last four years morgan shares in the firm s profit that may explain why , a few years ago , goldman executives began talking to the man many say has the inside track on stock deals in china mr fang the son of a midlevel government official , mr fang grew up in beijing and was a farmer , soldier and factory worker before attending zhongshan university , where he discovered a passion for economics mr fang also worked on his connections , particularly with two officials who are important figures in the goldman deal mr wang and zhou xiaochuan , the head of china s central bank in 2003 , mr zhou was china s top securities official when regulators seized hainan securities such relationships run deep in 1991 , after a trip to the united states , mr fang broached the idea of creating a westernstyle investment bank to mr wang , then vice governor of the china construction bank mr wang , a prot g of former prime minister zhu rongji , is a mr fixit in chinese government circles four years later , in 1995 , beijing approved morgan stanley s joint venture with china construction bank mr fang became a top executive in the new venture , cicc , and mr wang was named chairman , later succeeded by mr zhou at cicc , mr fang was called the rainmaker for his behindthescenes work on two landmark deals china mobile s 1997 stock offering and the restructuring of petrochina , another big stateowned oil company , which went public in 2000 after leaving the morgan venture in 2000 , mr fang worked for the bank of china international and then seemed to drift for several years , former colleagues said , taking time to study in the united states then late in 2002 or early 2003 , he got involved in government discussions on what to do with hainan securities in the early 1990 s , hainan securities was considered a pioneering retail brokerage firm but by 2003 , it had become a symbol of the country s troubled brokerage industry mounting debt and a series of lawsuits accusing company officials of embezzling millions of dollars from investors had led regulators to seize control of the firm that was when mr zhou , who was china s top securities regulator , turned to mr paulson of goldman sachs according to people involved in the talks , mr zhou asked if goldman was interested in paying an entrance fee to acquire a stake in a troubled stateowned brokerage house goldman officials were reluctant to invest in any brokerage firm with a checkered past but by june 2003 , mr fang and mr wang stepped into the negotiations and helped goldman massage the deal , the people involved in the talks said the result was that goldman would pay off some of hainan securities' debt and then start a jointventure bank with mr fang goldman sachs , people involved in the talks say , will have no future relation to hainan securities , which the government is expected to shut down once investors are repaid and goldman structured the agreement so that it could eventually get majority control , something morgan stanley never won with cicc but why hainan securities \? it had a prominent presence on the freewheeling island of hainan , which turns out to have been fertile ground for cementing relationships with chinese officials who would in time have leading positions in the economy it was a very small circle of people in the finance sector at that time and even fewer people in hainan , said zhang gaobo , a former top executive at hainan securities , which was founded by former central bank employees so everyone knew and saw each other frequently mr fang had met often with the founders of hainan securities in the early to mid90 s he set up a real estate subsidiary in hainan for china construction bank at the request of mr wang , then the bank s head , in 1992 that company , intime holdings , invested more than 1 million in a beachfront real estate project with hainan securities , according to company documents that real estate project now includes a hotel that mr fang s brother operates the property on which the hotel sits was later acquired by a conglomerate that mr fang and mr zhou , the central banker , helped prepare for a public offering when they were with cicc lu tao , one of the chinese officials overseeing the 67 million payout , said safeguards were in place to ensure that none of the donation money went to any related parties , including friends or relatives of mr fang or government officials in many ways , mr fang s ties to hainan are just the kind of connections goldman is banking on after all , in financial circles here , mr fang is considered the ultimate relationship man whenever anyone needs a chop , they go to fang , said a former cicc colleague , referring to the highly soughtafter government approval stamp yet victor shih , who teaches political science at northwestern university , said there are dangers in relying too heavily on the politically connected in china when you get someone well connected , he said , you get all the connections , but it s also volatile if they fall out of favor , or get involved in some corruption case , you 're in trouble still , people close to goldman s deal said that after the firm did its due diligence , it decided to bet on mr fang and his connections , including agreeing to lend him and his partners 100 million at a banquet in november to celebrate the deal , mr fang and richard gnodde , goldman s asia president , dined with wei liucheng , hainan s governor mr wei is the former chief executive of cnooc , a state oil company that mr fang helped take public in 2001 when he worked for bank of china international such old ties help explain why goldman sees mr fang as the ideal chinese partner
if it were n't tragic it would be a new yorker cartoon the president of the united states , in the final stop of his forlorn latin america tour last week , told the world , we do not torture even as he spoke , the administration s flagrant embrace of torture was as hard to escape as publicity for anderson cooper the vice president , not satisfied that the cia had already been implicated in four detainee deaths , was busy lobbying congress to give the agency a green light to commit torture in the future dana priest of the washington post , having first uncovered secret cia prisons two years ago , was uncovering new black sites in eastern europe , where ghost detainees are subjected to unknown interrogation methods redolent of the region s stalinist past before heading south , mr bush had been doing his own bit for torture by threatening to cast the first veto of his presidency if congress did n't scrap a spending bill amendment , written by john mccain and passed 90 to 9 by the senate , banning the cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment of prisoners so when you watch the president stand there with a straight face and say , we do not torture a full year and a half after the first photos from abu ghraib you have to wonder how we arrived at this ludicrous moment the answer is not complicated when people in power get away with telling bigger and bigger lies , they naturally think they can keep getting away with it and for a long time , mr bush and his cronies did not anymore the fallout from the scooter libby indictment reveals that the administration s credibility , having passed the tipping point with katrina , is flatlining for two weeks , the white house s talkingpoint monkeys in the press and congress had been dismissing patrick fitzgerald s leak investigation as much ado about nothing except politics and as an exoneration of everyone except mr libby now the american people have rendered their verdict they 're not buying it last week two major polls came up with the identical finding , that roughly 8 in 10 americans regard the leak case as a serious matter one of the polls \( the wall street journal nbc news \) also found that 57 percent of americans believe that mr bush deliberately misled the country into war in iraq and that only 33 percent now find him honest and straightforward , down from 50 percent in january the bush loyalists' push to discredit the libby indictment failed because americans do n't see it as a standalone scandal but as the petri dish for a wider culture of lying that becomes more visible every day the lastditch argument rolled out by mr bush on veterans day in his latest staythecourse speech that democrats , too , endorsed deadwrong wmd intelligence is more of the same sure , many democrats \( and others \) did believe that saddam had an arsenal before the war , but only the white house hyped selective evidence for nuclear weapons , the most ominous of all of iraq s supposed wmd s , to whip up public fears of an imminent doomsday there was also an entire other set of lies in the administration s prewar propaganda blitzkrieg that had nothing to do with wmd s , african uranium or the wilsons to get the country to redirect its finite resources to wage war against saddam hussein rather than keep its focus on the war against radical islamic terrorists , the white house had to cook up not only the fiction that iraq was about to attack us , but also the fiction that iraq had already attacked us , on 9 11 thanks to the michigan democrat carl levin , who last weekend released a previously classified intelligence document , we now have conclusive evidence that the administration s disinformation campaign implying a link connecting saddam to al qaeda and 9 11 was even more duplicitous and manipulative than its relentless flogging of nuclear armageddon senator levin s smoking gun is a widely circulated defense intelligence agency document from february 2002 that was probably seen by the national security council it warned that a captured qaeda terrorist in american custody was in all likelihood intentionally misleading interrogators when he claimed that iraq had trained qaeda members to use illicit weapons the report also made the point that an iraqqaeda collaboration was absurd on its face saddam s regime is intensely secular and is wary of islamic revolutionary movements but just like any other evidence that disputed the administration s fictional story lines , this intelligence was promptly disregarded so much so that eight months later in october 2002 , as the white house was officially rolling out its new war and congress was on the eve of authorizing it mr bush gave a major address in cincinnati intermingling the usual mushroom clouds with information from that discredited , intentionally misleading qaeda informant we 've learned that iraq has trained al qaeda members in bombmaking and poisons and deadly gases , he said it was the most important , if hardly the only , example of repeated semantic sleights of hand that the administration used to conflate 9 11 with iraq dick cheney was fond of brandishing a nonexistent april 2001 meeting between mohamed atta and an iraqi intelligence officer in prague long after czech and american intelligence analysts had dismissed it the power of these lies was considerable in a cbs news new york times poll released on sept 25 , 2001 , 60 percent of americans thought osama bin laden had been the culprit in the attacks of two weeks earlier , either alone or in league with unnamed others or with the taliban only 6 percent thought bin laden had collaborated with saddam and only 2 percent thought saddam had been the sole instigator by the time we invaded iraq in 2003 , however , cbs news found that 53 percent believed saddam had been personally involved in 9 11 other polls showed that a similar percentage of americans had even convinced themselves that the hijackers were iraqis there is still much more to learn about our government s duplicity in the runup to the war , just as there is much more to learn about what has gone on since , whether with torture or billions of iraq reconstruction dollars that is why the white house and its allies , having failed to discredit the fitzgerald investigation , are now so desperate to slow or block every other inquiry exhibit a is the senate intelligence committee , whose republican chairman , pat roberts , is proving a major farceur with his efforts to sidestep any serious investigation of white house prewar subterfuge last sunday , the same day that newspapers reported carl levin s revelation about the intentionally misleading qaeda informant , senator roberts could be found on face the nation saying he had found no evidence of political manipulation or pressure in the use of prewar intelligence his brazenness is not anomalous after more than two years of looking into the forged documents used by the white house to help support its bogus claims of saddam s niger uranium , the fbi ended its investigation without resolving the identity of the forgers last week , jane mayer of the new yorker reported that an investigation into the november 2003 death of an abu ghraib detainee , labeled a homicide by the us government , has been , in the words of a lawyer familiar with the case , lying kind of fallow the wall street journal similarly reported that 17 months after condoleezza rice promised a full investigation into ahmad chalabi s alleged leaking of american intelligence to iran , fbi investigators had yet to interview mr chalabi who was being welcomed in washington last week as an honored guest by none other than ms rice the times , meanwhile , discovered that mr libby had set up a legal defense fund to be underwritten by donors who do n't have to be publicly disclosed but who may well have a vested interest in the direction of his defense it s all too eerily reminiscent of the secret fund set up by richard nixon s personal lawyer , herbert kalmbach , to pay the legal fees of watergate defendants there s so much to stonewall at the white house that last week scott mcclellan was reduced to beating up on the octogenarian helen thomas you do n't want the american people to hear what the facts are , helen , he said , and i'm going to tell them the facts coming from the press secretary who vowed that neither mr libby nor karl rove had any involvement in the cia leak , this scene was almost as funny as his boss s we do not torture charade not that it matters now the facts the american people are listening to at this point come not from an administration that they no longer find credible , but from the far more realitybased theater of war the qaeda suicide bombings of three hotels in amman on 11 9 , like the terrorist attacks in madrid and london before them , speak louder than anything else of the price we are paying for the lies that diverted us from the war against the suicide bombers of 9 11 to the war in iraq
a day after the rev al sharpton said that he would not endorse any of the candidates in the democratic primary for mayor because none of them had a clear enough message , c virginia fields , one of the candidates , took a gentle potshot at him , suggesting he was repaying the candidates for their lack of support in his 2004 presidential campaign we respect the rev al sharpton and would have welcomed his endorsement , said a statement released by ms fields s campaign , but it comes as no surprise to us that he has decided not to endorse any of the four candidates as he has pointed out , none of the democratic candidates for mayor of new york city supported his bid for the presidency ms fields , the manhattan borough president and the only black candidate in the race , campaigned for john kerry in the primaries and the general election her associates say she had hoped for a position in his administration her opponents in the primary backed other presidential candidates or sat the campaign out fernando ferrer , the former bronx borough president , did not endorse any presidential candidate in the primaries because he did not want to insert the nonprofit organization he headed , the drum major institute for public policy , into the race , a spokesman said representative anthony d weiner endorsed gen wesley k clark and the city council speaker , gifford miller , supported howard dean none of the mayoral candidates chose to share ms fields s sentiments about mr sharpton s decision her campaign spokesman , nick charles , said her statement should not be interpreted as an attack on mr sharpton she said it because that s the reason he gave originally , mr charles said , adding that ms fields had told him that she had heard mr sharpton s remark about the lack of support for his presidential campaign at an unspecified event mr sharpton s aides did not dispute that he had made the remark as for the reason mr sharpton gave in an interview on wednesday with the new york times that no candidate had a compelling message mr charles said that ms fields was kind of ignoring that because she wo n't even answer that question ms fields , he said , did not plan to actively court mr sharpton but would accept his endorsement if he chose to give it in response to ms fields s statement , rachel noerdlinger , a spokeswoman for mr sharpton , reiterated his position that the candidates were not bringing forth compelling , winning strategies and ideas in the meantime , mr miller , the council speaker , spoke of endorsements by prominent black religious leaders however , one minister listed by his campaign , the rev clint miller of brown memorial baptist church in brooklyn , said he had issued no such endorsement gifford miller s campaign said later that the minister had promised his support , but then got cold feet
no limit these were perhaps the most striking words in the rezoning plan for the far west side of manhattan , also known as hudson yards they referred to the density limit that the city planning commission , until this week , intended to place on the commercial development of two blocks at the heart of hudson yards none developers would have been free to build towers on these blocks as large as they could there would have been no specified maximum under the density control called the floorarea ratio , or far , which has regulated building sizes throughout the city since 1961 \( in zoning districts with a ratio of 18 , for instance , the owner of a 10 , 000squarefoot lot may build a structure with 18 times the floor area , or 180 , 000 square feet \) visions of office towers soaring 80 stories and higher were conjured by community board 4 last year in its critique of the plan , which described the overall density as unprecedented , undesirable and ultimately unnecessary for the city s future when melinda katz , the chairwoman of the city council s land use committee , learned of the nolimit provision at a hearing last month , she told planning officials , i'm sure we 'll be getting back to you on that in a telephone interview yesterday , ms katz , a queens democrat , explained no 1 , i was concerned with precedent no 2 , we were uncomfortable as a council with passing something that basically took the authority for creating a limit away from us to the administration s credit , she said , a floorarea ratio of 33 was quickly imposed on the two blocks after objections to the nolimit proposal were raised that was one of several compromises made in the hudson yards plan before the committee approved it on monday , 15 to 0 , with 1 abstention it goes to the full council for a vote next wednesday the blocks in question are bounded by 10th and 11th avenues and 33rd and 35th streets they are known as the four corners because they would be bisected by a new northsouth midblock boulevard , which would effectively create four large building sites the southwest site would be directly over the new terminus of a planned extension of the no 7 subway line you have to have density to get vibrancy , said amanda m burden , chairwoman of the planning commission and director of the city planning department we believe that deeply , deeply , deeply at the same time , she said , planners do not expect construction of the office buildings to start until the expected completion of the no 7 line in 2010 the basic floorarea ratio on the four corners would be 10 , but a developer could add 8 by making payments into a district improvement fund to help finance the boulevard , parkland and subway extension the developer could add 15 more by purchasing development rights from the rail yard to the south because of a limit on the amount of transferable development rights from the rail yard , however , not all four corners sites could reach the maximum floorarea ratio , 33 while that ratio far exceeds the current limit of 216 in the zoning rules , city planners note that other skyscrapers have been constructed at roughly that density or greater it is not much different than the buildings that went up along times square , said sandy hornick , director of strategic planning at the planning department cautioning that density can be calculated in a variety of ways , mr hornick put the floorarea ratio of 7 times square \( times square tower \) at 42 5 times square \( ernst young \) , 36 4 times square \( cond nast \) , 31 and 3 times square \( reuters \) , 25 the point of removing density limits at the four corners , he said , was to allow developers flexibility in transferring development rights from the rail yard we did n't really think that people would build infinitely tall buildings , he said there are practical limits , as carol willis , the founding director of the skyscraper museum , noted in form follows finance \( princeton architectural press \) at some point in the construction of every skyscraper , she wrote in 1995 , the law of diminishing returns sets in , and rents for the additional stories do not cover costs including extra foundations , equipment and space for elevator shafts these days , there is another inhibition tenants might feel like targets on very high floors mr hornick said the cap of 33 far still offered developers a fair amount of flexibility , while addressing the council s concerns even with the compromises , however , community board 4 worries that the plan s transfer and bonus provisions resemble zoning for sale , said anthony m borelli , the district manager although the floorarea ratio has been in force as a zoning control for only 44 years , it was championed as early as 1907 by members of the municipal art society the society s current president , kent l barwick , applauded the planning commission for working so hard to make common ground with the council thinking of one of his predecessors , electus litchfield , who might be described as the father of far , mr barwick said , the pioneers of zoning understood that there had to be limits
yucaipa , calif , june 16 a minor earthquake rumbled southern california on thursday , shaking the ground from its epicenter near the town of yucaipa , about 70 miles east of los angeles , as far as the coastal town of laguna beach the earthquake , which had a magnitude of 49 , was the third to shake the state since early sunday morning , when a quake centered about 20 miles south of palm springs hit the second quake , which hit tuesday , began several miles below the ocean floor off the coast of northern california near the oregon border that undersea quake caused fears of a tsunami along the coast but seismologists said that the quakes did not necessarily portend a worse quake in the coming days these events are probably unrelated , that would be the wisdom on this one , said tom jordan , director of the southern california earthquake center , in a telephone interview typically earthquakes do n't interact on that scale there is a very slightly elevated chance of another earthquake in the next week , dr , jordan said , but the increase in probability is actually quite small in yucaipa , in the foothills of the san bernardino mountains , the quake shook tiles from ceilings in a supermarket , knocked books off shelves and rattled nerves all over town , though no injuries were reported at rosie s , a mexican restaurant on yucaipa boulevard , a 15yearold boy who identified himself only as alex said he had been playing video games at a friend s house when the quake hit i saw the window shaking and the picture frames started falling off the walls , alex said my friend s brother he s 11 started panicking he did n't know what to do , so my friend told all of us to get under a doorframe so we did , the three of us a firefighter who asked not to be identified because he was not authorized to speak on the record said he and his colleagues had inspected about 40 buildings in town after the quake and found damage in only a few , like the cracks in the walls of the baptist and seventhday adventist churches at the stater brothers supermarket , employees swept up debris from fallen ceiling tiles the bigger the building , the less give they had when the earthquake rode through , said the firefighter , a 30year veteran of the california department of forestry , which helps provide fire protection to the city but , he added , the quake did not cause a major ruckus earthquakes are no big surprise for us in this place , he said another firefighter , patti west , an engineer and paramedic at fire station no 1 , said she and her colleagues moved four fire trucks out of the station immediately after the quake in case it got stronger and knocked the building down they then answered a call from a woman who thought she smelled leaking gas in her home none was found tami johnston , 46 , a homemaker in yucaipa , described the quake as a big jolt at first she added , when we thought it had stopped , it started shaking again we felt several of the aftershocks ms johnston , who lives about half a mile from the epicenter , said she has a baby chihuahua who is a pretty good indicator of aftershocks she starts to whine , and then we look on the internet , and we 've had another one , ms johnston said as of thursday afternoon , about 25 aftershocks had hit southern california , said seismologists at the california institute of technology kate hutton of caltech said the clustering of earthquakes in the same week is not necessarily significant if you look at history , there are a lot of occasions where quakes have clumped in time even though they have been at slightly different locations , dr hutton said it does n't alarm us to see that happen , but on the other hand we do n't have an explanation for it
spring hill , tenn , nov 29 this was the factory that was going to revive the american automobile industry , proving that detroit could build quality cars and win back buyers who had defected to the japanese opened when auto companies were closing plants and cutting hundreds of thousands of jobs , general motors' saturn plant here was a rare opportunity for the company and its workers to literally leave the industry s old ways behind and embrace some of the lessons that japan was teaching , with an american twist now , saturn is in danger of falling victim to the fate this plant was intended to avoid the plant , the only one exclusively devoted to building saturn vehicles , is among 12 factories that gm plans to shut or partly close , eliminating 30 , 000 jobs in north america as it tries to recover from one of the worst slumps in its history next year , in a move that presages the end to gm s grand saturn experiment in spring hill , the company will shut one of two assembly lines at one of the most famous factories in the country while workers are hoping that gm will invest here to modernize the plant , the troubled auto company has made no commitment that would guarantee spring hill s future nestled in rolling farm country 30 miles south of nashville , workers and managers at the sprawling complex started out making decisions together and customers prized the vehicles because they came from a different kind of car company , as the saturn tagline went the saturn plant , like other efforts at gm to battle foreign competition , became a victim of the company s short attention span at a critical time when the plant needed to grow , gm instead poured money into sport utility vehicles and pickups , hoping to outwit the japanese only to see them invade those markets , too and workers here are paying the price workers have got to be asking themselves , what do we have to do \? said gary n chaison , a professor of industrial relations at clark university in worcester , mass the social contract was that if we build a quality product , we 're going to have jobs , our kids are going to have jobs , and the plant will still be in town , professor chaison said now , that idea is gone it certainly looks that way to michael o'rourke , who uprooted his wife and three children from wisconsin to come south saturn was the promise of a future he could not find at his old plant i still remember the day i gave away my snow blower , i was so happy , mr o'rourke , the president of the united automobile workers local here , said this week these days , mr o'rourke , who sits in an office with file cabinets plastered with bumper stickers reading i 3 5sheart 4 5 my saturn and buy american , buy union , faces an uncertain future along with his coworkers about 1 , 500 workers at the plant are set to lose jobs that gm originally assured them were guaranteed another 4 , 000 jobs at spring hill , the secondyoungest plant in gm s american network , may hinge on whether the auto company gives this factory new models to build even if gm does allot new work , the vehicles are likely to be other gm cars these saturn workers have learned the harsh reality that building quality cars and cooperating with management are not enough to save their jobs as in the past , their futures now depend primarily on whether their plants build vehicles that sell , which they cannot control , rather than how well they are built , which they can saturn workers are not the only ones getting this message gm also plans to close its wellregarded plants in oklahoma city and oshawa , ontario both have won the title of the best plant in north america by j d power associates , which publishes an annual ranking according to efficiency and quality gm s chief executive , rick wagoner , said last week that he regretted having to shut such heralded plants it s not an easy decision , mr wagoner said we do n't have many plants that are n't high quality and very productive but the heartbreak is especially deep at saturn , where the original promises that gm made its workers when the first cars were built there in 1990 have been steadily slipping away as sales have faltered by 25 percent from their 1994 peak , to about 221 , 000 last year , and its buzz has faded yet for a time , the saturn approach worked to extraordinary acclaim owners of toyotas and hondas were buying saturn s small cars on the belief that gm had matched their vehicles in quality in truth , saturns never consistently beat their japanese rivals in surveys performed by j d power or consumer reports , but saturn s consumerfriendly image and the almost cultlike following among saturn owners made it seem as though they did now , perception is not enough the best foreign manufacturers can build a half dozen or more different kinds of cars and trucks at their assembly plants in the united states and canada , and this allows them to quickly shift production when buyers' tastes change and with its market share eroding , and with 4 billion in north american losses just this year , gm is on a mission to do the same toyota and honda really have a remarkable capacity to put more than one vehicle in a plant , john paul macduffie , an associate professor at the wharton school of the university of pennsylvania , said last week gm just ca n't do that , except at a few factories workers in spring hill , where cows graze across railroad tracks from a plant that once became iconic in quirky television commercials , said they came here believing that they could help gm rebound and give the uaw a stronger voice saturn was an opportunity to show everyone the worker had some influence in the making and building of a car , that we were n't just line rats , said mark wunderlin , 49 , who moved here from oklahoma city in 1990 saturn workers took part in brainstorming sessions , sharing ideas with management that they might have never mentioned at a conventional plant leaders of the uaw served alongside gm executives on an advisory council , sharing decisions affecting saturn saturn had its own purchasing department , buying parts separately from gm and sometimes getting a better deal \( gm does not break down its results by line , so it is unclear how much profit or loss saturn has generated \) thousands of visitors and hundreds of corporate managers flocked here to get a glimpse of the saturn secret , which the company happily displayed , with tours of the plant and seminars in classrooms just a few feet away from the factory floor spring hill which had only 1 , 500 residents when gm selected the hamlet after a lively competition among politicians vying for the plant swelled to 17 , 000 people despite the risk of leaving their old jobs behind , workers were eager to come because there were to be no layoffs under the union contract at saturn \( the contract was changed last year after gm persuaded workers that it stood in the way of introducing new models to the plant \) when production slowed , workers were assigned to sweep the floors or paint white fences that stretched several miles around the plant but the saturn dream died well before the plant in the mid1990 s , when saturn reached its peak sales of just under 300 , 000 cars a year , plant and union officials were campaigning hard for an expansion so that the factory could build half a million vehicles a year they had a good argument buyers were outgrowing their small saturns , and with the toyota camry and honda accord regaining some of saturn s converts , saturn s partisans pleaded with gm for bigger cars gm executives , facing a hot market for suv s and pickups , and having already spent 5 billion at that point on saturn , decided , however , to pour money into developing trucks instead thus , there were no new saturn cars for four years and when gm finally decided to build a midsize saturn , the production went to wilmington , del , instead of spring hill by the time the spring hill plant got new vehicles to build , including a small suv called the vue , saturn s buzz was long gone and so was its status as a separate part of gm it s been a slow process , but little bites have been taken away , said darryl kilburn , 41 , an electrician whose wife , marlene , 50 , also works at spring hill they met here after coming to tennessee from other gm plants in michigan he from flint , she from lansing both were eager for a chance to start over but now , as back in michigan , you just do your job and go home , mr kilburn said gm officials say there is still an opportunity for saturn to win new business it plans four new vehicles for the saturn lineup , although none yet are earmarked for spring hill and may be built elsewhere the big issue for saturn is a simple one , and it s basically product , said david cole , chairman of the center for automotive research in ann arbor , mich saturn has n't had the array of products it needed gm is expected to send production of small saturn cars , built on the assembly line now planned to be shut , to another factory , perhaps at lordstown , ohio , where it recently expanded sylvia johnson , 54 , said she wondered if saturn could survive sitting in the gymnasium of the union hall , ms johnson recalled her excitement when she arrived in 1996 , after working for 20 years at an indiana parts plant that closed everyone had that gungho feeling , ms johnson said i thought we would still be doing the same thing for the next 30 , 40 years leo jones , 47 , shares her sense of disappointment ten years after he arrived from a gm plant in lansing , mich , where he had worked for a decade , mr jones has been laid off most of this year lately , he wishes he had stayed up north if i had to do it again , he said , i would n't come down here

moscow my parents named me victor in honor of the soviet union s victory over hitler , and i am proud of my name i see no reason to cast doubt on the historical significance of that victory for years the russian people , who lost millions of soldiers in the war , have united around the celebration of victory day yet , as we mark the 60th anniversary of the end of world war ii , we are seeing not so much a celebration as a major disagreement between millions of people , and even between nations this city , having summoned distinguished foreign guests for the occasion , chose to celebrate victory in genuine militarycamp style , full of guncarrying army and police patrols more fearful of terrorist attacks than ever before and who exactly is to blame for these painful paradoxes \? president vladimir putin himself effectively answered that question in his recent declaration that the collapse of the soviet union was the greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the century today s kremlin has neatly split the history of the soviet union into two , like splitting a block of birch wood with an axe it has cast aside the country s communist experiment as an unworkable utopia and begun glorifying soviet russia s imperial pretensions in other words , what has happened is pretty much the opposite of what khruschev did in the 1950 s when he sacrificed stalin s dictatorship in the name of lenin now the kremlin is sacrificing lenin in the name of generalissimus stalin schism is a terrible word in russia , where christians were once divided into the old believers and the followers of the reformed othodox church now a battle over the interpretation of russian history is provoking a schism throughout society half of the population elderly people , the poor , those not very well educated and resentful of perestroika see the creeping rehabilitation of stalin as a return to true values they are ready to erect monuments to stalin the victor around the country they are not disconcerted by his political crimes , for which they sometimes produce justifications that are beyond all comprehension there is no more logic in all this than there would be in jews suddenly deciding to erect a monument to hitler however , the other half of today s russia , made richer by the experiment of perestroika , knows more about stalin s crimes than it did even 15 years ago enlightened russia affirms that we won the victory despite stalin it hates him for his terror , his failure to prepare for war , his use of soldiers as cannon fodder , and for much more besides enlightened russia sees stalinist totalitarianism and hitler s regime as two sides of the same coin but the kremlin is pandering rashly and none too intelligently to the unenlightened , socially backward half of russia , refusing to understand that this bloc has no future in short , the schism has led russia into an ideological civil war by adopting the ideas of the soviet union as its heritage , mr putin s russia is entering into intellectual conflict with her western neighbors the kremlin is once again emphasizing its historical justification for the molotovribbentrop pact which gave germany permission to invade poland in exchange for soviet dominion over finland and much of the baltics and denying that baltic states were occupied it is also again trying to gloss over the massacre of polish troops at the katyn forest in 1940 \( after a period of public confessions from yeltsin \) and the rapes of hundreds of thousands of women by soldiers in the territory liberated by the red army the kremlin does not seem to understand that it no longer has any warsaw pact satellites that will applaud its every move rather , russia s neighbors now resent the way the soviet union treated them , and are new members of nato who like not feeling afraid of the kremlin any more they are justifiably furious at being offered old versions of history in the kremlin s new packaging political quarrels lead to scandalous rows i regret that some polish politicians want to name a square in warsaw after the slain chechen separatist leader dzhokhar dudayev my position is closer to that of the poles who believe that while the soviet union reduced poland to subjection , it also saved it from the national extinction that hitler intended but if russia stubbornly persists in taking everything that was once politically useful to the stalinist superpower as its own priorities , i am afraid that she will lose the ability to distinguish her victories from her defeats russia has never been as ideologically isolated in europe as she was on this victory day oped contributor victor erofeyev is the author of russian beauty this article was translated by andrew bromfield from the russian
the weather was so raw that the yankees rewarded their fans with future free tickets for showing up and staying around in the cold , the wind and the rain the yankees' power was so raw and so plentiful that mike mussina rode six home runs , including two each by alex rodriquez and jorge posada , to a 123 victory over the tigers that improved his record to 52 and the emotions were so raw in the late innings last night at yankee stadium that things became rather heated for hockey weather , there was hockey attitude and on the mound , in relief after mussina completed seven shutout innings , was a hockey fan , the canadianborn paul quantrill in apparent retaliation for a pitch that hit rodriguez in the thigh in the seventh and caused him to leave the game , quantrill drilled jason smith of detroit in the back after being warned by the homeplate umpire chad fairchild for throwing behind him in the eighth when several tigers stepped from the dugout to challenge him , quantrill gestured as if to encourage them if they want to come out , just come out , quantrill said later if they 've got a problem with me , standing six feet in front of the dugout and chirping is just nonsense there was no melee , but quantrill and manager joe torre were thrown out of the game franklyn german , detroit s 6foot7 , 260pound reliever who hit rodriguez , said he was just trying to throw a sinker inside and it got away from him gary sheffield , who had another of the yankees' home runs , had a different interpretation of events we know when guys are throwing at you on purpose , sheffield said alex has been our best hitter when he gets hit , you 've got to do something to protect him rodriguez hit a solo home run in the second and a tworun home run in the fourth , both off the tigers' starter and loser , wilfredo ledezma \( 24 \) rodriguez leads the major leagues in home runs with 16 and has 397 in his career he seemed irked and hurt as he jogged down to first base after being hit and was removed for a pinchrunner rodriguez did not want to talk much about the incident because , he said , so many good things happened today but , in response to questions , he said his thigh had a big bruise we 'll see tomorrow how it feels , rodriguez said it feels like i got stung pretty good the two teams meet again tonight and tomorrow night with this series coming between sets of games against yankees archrivals the mets last weekend at shea stadium , the red sox this weekend in the bronx some yankees fans might have wondered if their team would let down against detroit but the tigers are now respectable after losing 119 games in 2003 tigers manager alan trammell said it does n't look good when his pitcher hits someone who has hit two home runs , but he objected to quantrill s throwing twice at his hitter , the second one high he added , however , he s sticking up for his player , and i totally understand that mussina struck out six and gave up six hits and no walks combined with toronto s victory over boston , the yankees and the blue jays moved to a game and a half behind the secondplace red sox also homering for the yankees was robinson cano , the first of his

used last night could be converted into new tickets for games of either sept 6 or sept 8 against tampa bay much of the yankees' power came from players back in the lineup from injuries returning were derek jeter , sheffield and posada none started in the previous game , sunday s 53 victory over the mets at shea stadium , although jeter appeared as a pinchrunner sheffield also had missed the previous game with tendinitis in his left hand jeter was idle with a sore left elbow after being hit by a pitch and removed from saturday s game posada missed one game with a sore shoulder sheffield

the national hockey league and the nhl players' association reported no progress in bargaining last night after meeting with federal mediators for five hours in washington gary bettman , the nhl commissioner , said wednesday that the season would be canceled if lawyers for the sides were not drafting a collective bargaining agreement over the weekend to end the lockout , which began sept 16 no cancellation was announced yesterday , and the league issued a brief statement from its executive vice president , bill daly , that said , no progress in the collective bargaining process resulted from the meeting ted saskin , the senior director of the union , said in a statement , there was no progress should the nhl cancel its season , it would become the first north american professional league to lose its entire regular schedule and playoffs in a collective bargaining dispute no players or owners participated yesterday , nor did bettman or bob goodenow , the executive director of the union daly and saskin each took a lawyer to the meeting , which was requested by scot b beckenbaugh , the acting director of the federal mediation and conciliation service previous involvement of mediators was revealed thursday by daly the sides said then that mediators were sincere but ineffective because the parties know each other s positions the league wants a salary cap and what it calls cost certainty to link salaries as a fixed percentage of revenue the players have refused both concepts but offered a 24 percent salary rollback and other concessions over the weekend , there were reports of a new union proposal being prepared , but none were presented a union spokesman , jonathan weatherdon , said , rumors to that effect were quite false daly suggested in a radio interview in canada on friday that the league might consider a salary cap without linking revenue and payroll the union dismissed the idea , and said that the league should present new concepts to the union first in an email message , saskin wrote i have not heard anything from the nhl on this they have always told us that linkage was their method to set arbitrary team caps and that their league cap and team caps were inextricably intertwined bryan smolinski of ottawa , playing on a minor league team in suburban detroit , said that the 24 percent salary rollback offered by the players on dec 9 could have been the basis for a settlement we gave up more than we should , and they rejected that , he said , adding that owners want players to fix the mistakes of owners nhl teams have cited 497 million in losses the past two seasons , a figure the union disputes smolinski said players still wanted to compromise things are coming to a head , he said there s always hope the pressure is on both sides let s find out where the middle is
philadelphia , march 28 in many of her 10 seasons at rutgers , coach cvivian stringer has found herself pleading with her players to believe in themselves they would be facing a game against connecticut or tennessee or stanford , and stringer could see doubt take a debilitating hold on them before the ball took its first bounce that psychological effect is part of how the nation s top women s teams have stayed the nation s top women s teams , why the final four often resembles a reunion of the same old hands everyone expects the powerhouses to win , even their opponents perhaps this team is the one that understands that our greatest fear is ourselves , our own minds , what we 're thinking , stringer said on monday , as stringer prepared her team to face topseeded tennessee in a regional final tuesday at temple s liacouras center for a spot in the final four , no pleading was necessary rutgers , after all , had beaten tennessee by 14 in their regularseason meeting it had also notched a victory over uconn to end a 12game losing streak against the huskies , a big east conference nemesis now , in the ncaa tournament , as teams like uconn have fallen , the talk has centered on a new parity in the women s game , with rutgers cited as a prime example but the scarlet knights are not exactly a surprise , considering the impressive victories in their 256 regular season rutgers , though , has been carrying its no 3 seeding around with an unusual swagger the topseeded teams are all still playing , but to rutgers , they do not look so daunting anymore this year , it s up for grabs , forward michelle campbell said there is no set team where you can say , 'oh , they 're going to win' everybody s beating everybody this year to that , stringer nods with longawaited approval i always believed that if we would believe enough in ourselves , that we could do far more damage than what most people realize , she said although she ranks third on the career coaching list with 723 victories in 33 years , and although she led rutgers to the final four in 2000 , her scarlet knights are still trying to crack the barrier separating them from the elite programs she has convinced her players that the barrier is in their minds i think it s like 90 percent mental , the senior guard chelsea newton said it s never been physical we 've always been the bestconditioned team all the drills , we can do perfectly for us to come into games believing in ourselves , that s the most important thing , and that s what the year has come down to that is why the scarlet knights point to the 6551 victory over tennessee on dec 29 as a critical juncture yes , it was a home game , and tennessee point guard loree moore was recovering from a tonsillectomy and did not play , but the scarlet knights used the emotional boost to win at no 3 texas four days later and topple no 1ranked louisiana state three days after that the scarlet knights are not a feast for the eyes they are a gritty , defensefirst team their most accomplished player , the senior guard cappie pondexter , did not play until late december after sitting out the first semester for personal reasons after rutgers toppled ohio state on sunday to reach the regional final , buckeyes coach jim foster called the scarlet knights a prototypical stringer team , which meant they were about as fun to play against as a pack of porcupines i think that we play from our hearts and our minds , stringer said , smiling at foster s characterization in tennessee , rutgers runs into a team and a coach that stringer admires deeply she and pat summitt consider each other friends they once roomed together at a coaching function and even occasionally go shopping together , although summitt describes it as uniquely frustrating because she has incredible patience and i have none when they take their spots on opposite benches , summitt looks at the game from a position of dominance she is the career leader in victories with 880 , and under her , tennessee has won six national championships in 15 trips to the final four in the annals of dynasties , the lady vols have their own chapter to tennessee , not having won a title since 1998 seems like an unbearable drought for stringer , still chasing her first championship , the lady vols' seemingly annual trip to the final four represents nirvana that s my dream , stringer said that s what i work toward once you 've established that you 're a perennial power , it s not very difficult to recruit when you 're successful , people want to be a part of it you 're calling people , and all of a sudden , they 're trying to call you it makes a big difference she hopes her pleading days are behind her
welcome to 2005 the year of the french and indian war actually \? make that years , plural the celebration is continuing through 2010 it seems that new york would like to be known as the french and indian war state , since it will serve as host of a national , and international , fiveyearlong commemoration of the many battles that took place within its borders just exactly why are we supposed to care about this bicenquinquagenary \? well , for starters , this war is why we speak english and not french today , said bob bearor , a french and indian war reenactor from newcomb , ny , who has written five books about new york as the bloody ground for french insurgent fighters and their indian allies to history lovers , the conflict is increasingly seen as a crucible for the american revolution and a war college for george washington most of the battles were fought in this state , mr bearor added it was a war for an empire , and it changed the fate of the world the latest rediscovery of an underheralded war prompted gov george e pataki to sign legislation in november creating the new york state french and indian war 250th anniversary commemoration commission , a 19member group charged with organizing , promoting and carrying out a series of reenactment tourism events , the act says the panel will also encourage studies of the french and indian war from kindergarten through grade 12 in new york state schools the unpaid commissioners are soon to be appointed , and meetings to determine a schedule of commemorative events will begin this winter the battles of the french and indian war , the governor said in a statement , were the driving force for inspiring the values and ideals that led to the successful drive toward american independence , and the birth of freedom and democracy in the new world and there is always visitorship the war s anniversary is a major historic event that could be important for tourism upstate , said state senator george d maziarz , republican of niagara county , who was a champion of the legislation about that name in europe they call the french and indian war the seven years' war french canadians call it la guerre de sept ans other canadians have termed it the war of the conquest and just like civil war battles that were differently designated in the north and south , the new york conflicts have competing names above and below the canadian border for example , fort ticonderoga was known by the french as fort carillon , and lac du saint sacrement was renamed lake george by the english in honor of their king it was winston churchill who , in history of the englishspeaking peoples , called the seven years' war the first world war , since it was the first conflict of european countries fought out in north america , the caribbean , west africa , india and the philippines but the war has often been relegated to footnote status , since historians tended to write out everything that did n't lead directly to the revolutionary war , said dr fred anderson , professor of history at the university of colorado at boulder and an expert on the seven years' war the french and indian war was a flashpoint of the maritime and colonial conflict between france and england which had previously been contending for domination of the north american continent for more than a century and it began with a land dispute over control of the ohio valley none other than the inexperienced 22yearold george washington was a catalyst , triggering the war on may 28 , 1754 , when the contingent of virginia soldiers and native warriors he was leading ambushed a french detachment and killed its commander , joseph coulon de villiers , sieur de jumonville though the french had many early victories , the tide ultimately turned in favor of the english , and they won control of canada in 1760 , a year after their victory on the plains of abraham at what is now quebec city the war continued in europe , africa and asia until 1763 , when the treaty of paris formally concluded hostilities france lost all of its colonies in north america to the english , except for two coastal islands historians had long discounted the importance of indians in the french and indian war because the attitude was that they chose the wrong side and they were doomed , said dr anderson but , he said , research in recent years has shown that indians controlled every single historical outcome on the north american continent from the 1500 s to the middle of the 18th century they had always managed to play one side off against the other , but it did n't work in the seven years' war ultimately , though the british booted the french out of the north american continent , they ended up with an empire they could n't control and with debts they could n't pay , dr anderson said england s imposition of new taxes alienated not only the colonies but also that former anglophile , george washington indeed , it is the seven years' war that makes washington as we know him possible it shaped his attitudes and made him a competent military commander , dr anderson said , adding that the war also taught colonists how to establish a militia and gave them a taste for controlling their own destiny to dr anderson , without the french and indian war , it is impossible for me to imagine that the american revolution would have taken place , he said the dominoes dislodged by washington in 1754 just kept falling the french and indian conflict led , ultimately , to disaster for the french , dr anderson said they got their revenge for losing by helping the americans to win the war against the english , he said but that left the french crown so deeply in debt that the result was the french revolution dr anderson foreshadowed some of those insights in his book crucible of war , published in 2000 , and has gone further in putting the seven years' war at the center of american history in dominion of war empire and liberty in north america , 15002000 , which he wrote with andrew caton , to be published next week by viking our schools teach a lot about the revolutionary war , but not about the french and indian war , senator maziarz said mr bearor has long tried to raise consciousness about the conflict , and credited the late david l dickinson , niagara county historian , with heading the recognition effort among the literary reimaginings of the era were northwest passage by kenneth roberts , as well as james fenimore cooper s leatherstocking tales \( in the 1992 film the last of the mohicans , daniel daylewis played the role of hawkeye \) but there is live drama in the french and indian war reenactments , a colorful mix of those wearing the red of british regulars , as well as highlanders with bagpipes , not to mention colorful french militia and marine units , as well as those portraying indians mr bearor estimates that there are as many as 3 , 000 fi reenactors in the united states and another 800 in canada some of them had tired of the sameold rev war and civ war events , as they term them , and became fi devotees the french and indian war opened up a whole new genre , said mr bearor , a retired troy , ny , firefighter whose bestknown history book is the battle on snowshoes , \( heritage books , 1997 \) canadian reenactors , too , will be participating in the new york events one of them will be daniel roy , the direct descendant of a french marine who arrived in new france in 1720 the french lost the empire but no one ever conquered the french spirit , said mr roy , a warrant officer in the canadian air force who has been a reenactor for 12 years he carries an epee and flintlock pistol and portrays captain lacorne , a marine commander i feel we are helping canadians to rediscover their own culture the schedule of french and indian war reenactments began last summer in pennsylvania and commemorated george washington s 1754 battle at fort necessity future reenactment events in new york are likely to include lake george this summer , fort bull in 2006 , fort william henry in 2007 , fort ticonderoga in 2008 , fort niagara in 2009 , and fort levis in 2010 i'm so glad that new york is giving recognition to this history , said george larrabee , a 70yearold reenactor from woodbury , vt , who said he was proud of his indian blood since 1982 , he has been portraying the character of peskunck , an abenaki warrior , paddling a 16foot birchbark canoe , carrying his flintlock musket and wearing a headdress of wild turkey feathers painted to resemble those of the spotted eagle , a protected species i do n't know that indians regretted picking the wrong side , mr larrabee said even if indians had picked the english side , it would n't have done them any good , because the english thought of them as dirty savages and treated them terribly
george macdonald fraser is now 80 , or almost as old as his great creation sir harry flashman was when flashman selfproclaimed cad , poltroon , card cheat and serial fornicator began writing the multivolume autobiography that we know as the flashman papers mr fraser has just published the 12th installment , flashman on the march , which , like its author , and like flashman himself , for that matter , shows no signs of flagging in this volume , flashman , finding himself in a bit of bother after seducing an underage austrian princess , eludes her angry guardians by joining the 1868 british mission to rescue the european hostages held by king theodore of abyssinia , who happens to be insane or as flash might say , not quite 16 anas to the rupee while cowering in typical fashion , trying to save his own neck , flashman nevertheless manages , also in typical fashion , to get credit for saving the whole operation along the way , he is suspended in a metal cage over an abyss , sends a princess to her death over the blue nile falls and is a more than willing participant in an orgy readers of tom brown s schooldays , if there are any left , will recall that by far the most interesting character in that otherwise preachy novel is also named flashman he s the bully who mercilessly persecutes tom until finally being expelled for drunkenness it was mr fraser s genius to see that such a fellow , a bully , a coward and a liar , far from coming to nothing , as his headmaster predicted , could go a long way in the days of the empire this revelation came to mr fraser in the late 1960 s , when , after a wartime stint in the british army , he embarked on a career as a journalist he had taken a job at the glasgow herald , mr fraser recalled in a recent telephone interview from the isle of man , where he lives now , and after five years as deputy editor , he was promoted to editor in chief that assignment lasted three months , and then he was demoted to his old job facing 20 more years as deputy , i thought , who needs this \? he said in a voice that still retains a hint of his parents' scottish burr i said to my wife , 'i'm going to write my way out of this' he decided to write a victorian novel , he explained , and out of the blue he remembered flashman it seemed to me obvious that he would go into the army , mr fraser said , which is exactly what flashman does in mr fraser s first novel , called simply flashman and published in 1969 flashman buys a commission , survives a duel \( by tampering with his opponent s cartridges \) , reluctantly acquires a wife the sweet but brainless elspeth , who is possibly more of a philanderer than he is and winds up in the afghan war , where , in spite of passing out with fear , he is acclaimed as the hero of jalalabad though mr fraser had n't planned on a sequel , one followed a year later , and then another , and soon he had hit on a bestselling formula flash behaves abominably , turns up at some historic battle or event , where , despite his cowardice and treachery , he somehow lands on his feet and is hailed as a hero as book follows book , flashman s star keeps rising , and the little who s who entry at the front of each volume grows longer and longer , piling up awards and accomplishments a knighthood , the victoria cross , the congressional medal of honor , a governorship at rugby \( the school from which he was expelled \) , the honorary presidency of something called the mission for reclamation of reduced females , a project no doubt dear to his heart , since over the course of the novels flashman also beds numberless women 480 by his rough count in flashman and the angel of the lord , and that s only volume ix you might suppose that as a prefect at rugby , flashman would also have acquired a taste for what thomas arnold , that school s famous headmaster , called beastliness with young boys , but mr fraser will hear none of it no , no , he said adamantly quite the opposite what saves the flashman books from repetitiveness or predictability is that they are also genuine historical novels , meticulously researched from original sources and full of authentic period detail flashman sooner or later meets everyone who was anyone in the 19th century the queen , prince albert , bismarck , lincoln , oscar wilde , lily langtry , florence nightingale and appears not as a zelig but as a fullfledged participant in most of the century s great events the indian mutiny , the boxer rebellion , the charge of the light brigade \( which he leads , in fact , spurred by an attack of flatulence brought on by drinking too much inferior champagne \) , the siege of khartoum , the raid at harpers ferry , the battle of little big horn \( where it s likely that he inadvertently shoots custer \) , the mexican revolution and the execution of maximilian mr fraser has a reputation in england for being a bit of a curmudgeon and a kneejerk tory a member not so much of the old school , an article in the sunday telegraph put it , as of the school they knocked down when the old school was built but the flashman books actually add up to a revisionist critique of received british history , at least in its romanticized imperial phase time after time , the great policies and campaigns turn out to be based on folly or misunderstanding or disguised selfinterest , and the great victories are a result less of heroism than of chance or mere stubbornness legendary generals like cardigan and raglan , seen up close , prove to be not much firmer in moral purpose than flashman , and a good deal stupider besides for the first time in the series , the new book also includes an explanatory note that is a little nod in the direction of contemporary history writing about the abyssinian campaign , little known today but immensely controversial at the time , mr fraser , an outspoken opponent of britain s role in iraq , points out that the expedition was sent out in a good and honest cause by a government who knew what honour meant , and adds it was not sent until every hope of a peaceful issue was gone it went with the doubt that it was right it served no politician s vanity or interest it went without messianic rhetoric there were no false excuses , no deceits , no coverups or lies to quote flashman again , those were the days as the series goes on , the books actually get better , in part because flashman grows into his character and his language , which is judiciously laced with victorian slang he uses the expression knuckle the walnut for knocking on a door , for example , and pump the fin for shaking hands , and he has an inexhaustible supply of synonyms for the female breast he sometimes sounds the way p g wodehouse s bertie wooster would if bertie had a libido which makes perfect sense when you realize that bertie and flash derive from the same source , the derringdo adventure stories of victorian writers like g a henty and thomas mayne reid mr fraser read them all , he said , because his father was a very clever boy at school and won those books as prizes some critics have suggested that as the series has evolved , flashman has also become wiser and mellower i suppose he s grown up a bit , mr fraser said that s my own aging process no doubt but i do n't think he s getting nicer i was delighted when my daughter read the new book and said he s back to being nasty he added i 've gone from my late 40 s to my 80 s with flashman i have a great sort of feeling for him , though i do n't think i would have liked him

indian head , md even now , more than nine months later , 3yearold autumn potts will not sleep in her bedroom she is afraid somebody will come during the night and burn down her house on dec 6 , flames lighted up the night sky , and smoldering chunks of wood flew through the air as autumn and her family sped in cars up cabinwood court in hunters brooke , an expensive new subdivision 25 miles south of washington in charles county , md that night , 10 houses were destroyed and 16 others were heavily damaged at a cost of 10 million we just saw the flames leaping from house to house , and we did n't know if we were going to make it out alive , autumn s mother , terri rookard , said but they did make it , and although their home escaped damage , ms rookard , who is black , has yet to figure out how she will tell her daughter what she believes is the reason someone set fire to all those houses i never thought i would have to go through something like this , ms rookard , a program manager at the state department , said before the fires , i never overtly experienced racism the conviction in september of patrick s walsh , 22 , leader of five young men who were charged in the arsons , has brought some relief to ms rookard and other residents of hunters brooke the houses have been rebuilt , and the families , some of whom were days away from moving in at the time of the fires , have finally arrived but racist statements attributed to three of the five suspects , all of them white , and racial incidents in the area since the fires have left a pall that may take longer to clear most of the families who lost their homes were black and looking for more in the way of housing than their money could buy closer to washington in recent years , more middle and upperincome families have moved to charles county , where builders have turned woods and tobacco fields into new developments with homes that sell from 300 , 000 to more than 1 million since 1990 , the population of the county has increased about 36 percent , to 137 , 000 , and the proportion of blacks has grown , to 33 percent from 18 percent some black leaders here see the arsons as part of a pattern of racism in charles county the ku klux klan rallied a decade ago in la plata , the county seat anonymous fliers distributed in the racially mixed community of waldorf in 1999 urged white brothers sisters of charles county to kill blacks and , in january , before the rebuilding of the homes at hunters brooke had even begun , thousands of racist and antisemitic fliers were thrown on driveways and lawns within six miles of the community some of the fliers read do n't have sex with blacks avoid aids the sheriff s office recorded 15 racially motivated crimes in the first seven months of 2005 , including vandals spraypainting kkk on roads and racial epithets and swastikas on roads and buildings the county had 21 racerelated crimes last year and 8 in 2003 , the sheriff s office said mr walsh , prosecutors said , had an obsession with setting fires and had worried aloud about blacks moving to hunters brooke jeremy d parady , another suspect , admitted in a guilty plea in april that he had singled out the development because many of the buyers were black , and a third suspect who pleaded guilty , aaron l speed , had made racist statements to investigators , according to court documents the three men are awaiting sentencing none of the five suspects have been charged with a hate crime , and prosecutors declined to say why , citing the coming trials for the two remaining suspects some law enforcement officials said searches of the suspects' homes , computers and cars turned up no hate group or white supremacist materials or other evidence suggesting racial motives prosecutors have suggested other motivations an effort to gain notoriety for a local gang , envy of people who could afford halfmilliondollar homes and revenge on the part of mr speed , a former hunters brooke security guard , who told investigators that he was upset that his security company showed little sympathy when his infant son died but william braxton , president of the charles county national association for the advancement of colored people , said investigators and some community leaders downplayed the arson as just a bunch of young boys who lost their way the africanamerican community is not buying that at all , mr braxton said people see within their hearts that this thing was racially motivated f wayne cooper , president of the fivemember charles county board of commissioners , said reports of possible racism as a motive have hurt the county s reputation it is a poor image to set for the county , said mr cooper , who is white he said some residents did comment about people from up north in prince george s county , which is predominantly black , moving to charles and , in turn , increasing crime and worsening schools but mr cooper said that racism did not underlie those concerns and that the county embraced newcomers of any race or ethnic background members of a few white families said they believed envy , not racism , motivated the arsonists they were jealous people other than them could afford these houses , judy manning , a white homeowner in hunters brooke , said whatever the motivation , the fires disrupted lives and deferred dreams coming here was like our escape from the city , going out to the country , to raise a family here , said jacque hightower , a training officer at the department of housing and urban development mr hightower , his wife and three children , who had planned to move into hunters brook by dec 8 , lived in a cramped apartment in waldorf for eight months while their house was rebuilt what a christmas present we had that year , mr hightower said but if mr hightower , who is black , and many others believe racism was a motivation for the arsons , that has not driven them away hunters brooke residents say only one family in the community , which will ultimately have 319 homes , accepted the offer of the builder , lennar corporation , to back out of their contract and move elsewhere charles s gordon , a corrections officer , said he had second thoughts about living in hunters brooke after the fires , even though his house was not burned but , he said , if you run from racism , you 'd be running the rest of your life , because racism s everywhere after the arsons , some families installed home security systems , and at least one family bought guns for selfprotection those who have moved in say the aftermath of the arsons meeting their future neighbors amid charred ruins , commiserating , meeting with one another and the builder , holding a nighttime vigil has drawn them closer to one another the diversity and friendship was easy to see one saturday afternoon blacks , whites , pakistanis , indians , koreans and filipinos savored the sunshine in their yards , on porches and in driveways teenagers gossiped on front lawns a man hauled rocks for a patio a woman , just moving in , unpacked boxes in her garage families returned from soccer and football and cheerleading practices one homeowner , harold jewett , a driver for united parcel service , recalled the horror of watching his house burn down on television but now he admires his rebuilt , airy home with a designer kitchen and twocar garage , and he smiles racism s still in the back of your mind , but , you know , you have to live your life , he said it s healing time now
east rutherford , nj , sept 11 the return of kurt warner , eli manning s predecessor as the giants' quarterback , provided a convenient generational handoff story line for the giants' season opener against the arizona cardinals but sunday , manning had plenty of helping hands as he grabbed the franchisequarterback mantle in his first season opener as a starter manning had an inconsistent first half , with two interceptions , including one that was returned for a touchdown but the newest members of the team took hold of the game , and perhaps of the franchise s future , sending the giants on a fivetouchdown secondhalf burst that allowed them to run away from the cardinals , 4219 , at giants stadium it was the kind of performance that could make a general manager smile the prize freeagent receiver plaxico burress caught a touchdown pass and set up another the rookie running back brandon jacobs scored a touchdown the freeagent punt returner chad morton , signed just a week ago , returned a punt for a touchdown the giants had not produced this many points since dec 22 , 2002 , when they scored 44 against indianapolis coach tom coughlin , whose son tim escaped from the world trade center on sept 11 , 2001 , said the giants were motivated to win on the anniversary of the terrorist attacks pregame ceremonies included family members of victims of the attacks , and coughlin wore an fdny cap throughout the game he told his players during the week and at halftime , when the giants trailed by 137 , that they could not lose on this day there was no way we were going to lose at home , on this date , for this great city , for these great people , coughlin said the emotions generated by the anniversary powered the giants through their earlygame foibles , and arizona was the perfect foil the cardinals were out of secondhalf timeouts with 5 minutes 3 seconds remaining in the third quarter their special teams gave up two returns for touchdowns their running game \( 21 rushes for 31 yards \) was all but nonexistent warner s performance \( 27 of 46 for 264 yards , one touchdown , one interception and 3 sacks \) hinted that he might be in for the same quick hook in arizona that he received in new york so perhaps this victory is not a true barometer of the progress the giants hope to make this season after all , if manning , who missed three weeks of the preseason with a sprained elbow , cannot complete 50 percent of his passes against the cardinals \( he was 10 of 23 for 172 yards \) , imagine what the eagles might do to him but this was exactly the kind of game the giants are supposed to win , trouncing an inferior opponent and they got a glimpse of what they hoped their offseason acquisitions might provide we are trying to surround ourselves with as many playmakers as we can , coughlin said they seem to have found quite a few the giants started off well , with manning completing a 20yard pass to jeremy shockey for the opening score but after an arizona field goal , a manning pass to david tyree sailed high and into cardinals linebacker karlos dansby s hands dansby returned the interception 18 yards to give the cardinals a 107 lead a sack of warner on another drive forced the cardinals to kick a 42yard field goal after manning was intercepted by dansby again in the second quarter , a sack by michael strahan , who had one and a half sacks , forced the cardinals out of fieldgoal position that defensive flurry bought the giants' offense and special teams enough time , and they were transformed in the third quarter on the opening drive of the second half , burress found himself in oneonone coverage down the sideline as a manning pass came his way he leaped , caught it , and jacobs , a 6foot4 , 256pound running back , who may finally provide the thunder to tiki barber s lightning , barreled in for a touchdown to give the giants a lead they would not surrender it made me believe i can be in the nfl as much as any guy , said jacobs , who was a fourthround pick from southern illinois two more touchdowns came in rapid succession on the cardinals' first offensive play after the touchdown , warner floated a pass that landed gently in gibril wilson s hands wilson returned the interception to arizona s 21yard line , and on the next play , barber ran up the middle for a touchdown arizona countered with an eightplay touchdown drive , highlighted by four receptions by the secondyear receiver larry fitzgerald but willie ponder returned the ensuing kickoff for a 95yard touchdown , the third touchdown of the quarter for the giants i just wanted to make a splash , ponder said in the fourth quarter , manning made his finest play , rolling right and throwing a 13yard laser to burress in the end zone burress had 5 receptions for 76 yards , and amani toomer , who used to be the primary receiver , had none , the first time in 98 games that toomer had not caught a pass finally , morton who was released by the patriots at the end of training camp scored on a 52yard punt return for the game s final score by that time , the celebration of the newlook giants had begun strahan and barber remain the necessary backbone of the team , but it is manning , burress , jacobs and morton who may someday take the reins from them and lead the giants forward on sunday , they took one giant step extra points right tackle kareem mckenzie , in his first game with the giants , sprained his left ankle near the end of the first half and left the sideline on a cart xrays were negative tight end jeremy shockey also injured his ankle with his 56yard punt late in the third quarter , giants punter jeff feagles set the nfl career record for most punts with 1 , 368 , passing sean landeta the punt pinned arizona on its 13yard line
washington , feb 26 there is widening unease within the central intelligence agency over the possibility that career officers could be prosecuted or otherwise punished for their conduct during interrogations and detentions of terrorism suspects , according to current and former government officials until now , only one cia employee , a contract worker from north carolina , has been charged with a crime in connection with the treatment of prisoners , stemming from a death in afghanistan in 2003 but the officials confirmed that the agency had asked the justice department to review at least one other case , from iraq , to determine if a cia officer and interpreter should face prosecution in addition , the current and former government officials said the agency s inspector general was now reviewing at least a halfdozen other cases , and perhaps many more , in what they described as an expanding circle of inquiries to determine whether cia employees had been involved in any misconduct previously , intelligence officials have acknowledged only that several cases were under review by the agency s inspector general but one government official said , there s a lot more out there than has generally been recognized , and people at the agency are worried of particular concern , the officials said , is the possibility that cia officers using interrogation techniques that the government ruled as permissible after the sept 11 terrorist attacks might now be punished , or even prosecuted , for their actions in the line of duty the details of some of the inquiries have been reported , but the government officials said other cases under review have never been publicly disclosed officials declined to provide details of all the cases now under scrutiny they would not say whether the reviews were limited to incidents in iraq and afghanistan , where cia officers have been particularly active , or whether they might extend to cases from other countries , possibly including secret sites around the world where three dozen senior leaders of al qaeda are being held by the agency the officials said that the concern within the ranks had been growing since the agency s removal of its station chief in baghdad , iraq , in december 2003 in part because of concerns about the deaths of two iraqis who had been questioned by cia employees the reason for the station chief s removal has not been previously disclosed former and current intelligence officials say the action occurred nearly four months before a wider pattern of abuse at abu ghraib prison in iraq became publicly known the removal was ordered by senior officials at cia headquarters in washington within several weeks of their learning about the deaths of the iraqi prisoners in separate incidents in response to the reviews , the cia has already made a number of significant changes to its rules on interrogation and detention as a new safeguard against problems , the officials said asked about the inspector general s reviews , an intelligence official described them as a robust effort on the part of the cia to ensure that its conduct had been proper the inspector general is working collaboratively with counterparts in the military services in all investigations , the official said the agency has referred some cases to the justice department for a review of possible criminal charges under the federal torture law , which forbids extreme interrogation tactics , and under civil rights laws more commonly used in police brutality prosecutions justice department officials said that prosecutors working in a special unit in alexandria , va , were conducting criminal inquiries into the possible mistreatment of detainees by nonmilitary personnel , but that they would not discuss what cases were being reviewing or whether they would charge anyone with crimes justice department officials would say only that several cases involving civilian employees of the government had been referred to the department they would not discuss which cases were under scrutiny or what agencies had sought the department s review but they said such reviews would seek to determine whether the facts in the cases warrant prosecution under several federal statutes , among them the civil rights laws , which bar government employees from using excessive force , and the federal torture law , which forbids the use of extreme interrogation techniques on detainees in one of the cases that contributed to the removal of the station chief , an iraqi named manadel aljamadi died under cia interrogation in a shower room at abu ghraib on nov 4 , 2003 it is probable that he died of wounds inflicted by commandos of the navy seals who struck him in the head with rifle butts after they and cia officers captured him but former intelligence officials said there were still questions about the role played by a cia officer and contract interrogator who had taken custody of mr jamadi and were questioning him at abu ghraib at the time of his death mr jamadi had not been examined by a physician at the time he was brought to abu ghraib , because the cia officers had circumvented procedures in which he was to have been registered with the military the death was among the most notorious to emerge from the incidents at abu ghraib that became public last spring , in part because the man s body was photographed wrapped in plastic and packed in ice in another widely publicized incident , an iraqi commander , maj gen abed hamed mowhoush , died after he was shoved headfirst into a sleeping bag by army interrogators , after several days of questioning that also involved at least one cia officer an autopsy showed that general mowhoush died of asphyxia due to smothering and chest compression showing evidence of blunt force trauma to the chest and legs , according to army officials in both those cases , american military personnel are facing disciplinary proceedings , including hearings in colorado in which several army soldiers are being tried on murder charges the death at abu ghraib is still being investigated by the cia s inspector general , and has been referred to the justice department for possible prosecution , the current and former intelligence officials said none of the reviews at the cia have been completed , but they include a broad assessment of detention and interrogation procedures in iraq , the officials said already , they said , senior officials at the cia have ordered broad changes as a result of the review , including some that would impose strict limits on the use of coercive techniques used to extract information from suspected terrorists , the officials said intelligence officials had previously described the shakeup of the cia s baghdad operations as related to concerns about the officer s capacity to manage the agency s large and fastgrowing station in iraq but in recent interviews , current and former intelligence officials said that while those accounts were partly accurate , the action was also prompted by concerns that the baghdad station chief had not paid enough attention to issues surrounding the detention and interrogation of prisoners there is no indication that the former station chief , who has since left the cia , is under any kind of criminal scrutiny , the officials said to date , the cia has publicly acknowledged possible wrongdoing in a case of prisoner abuse in only one case , involving david passaro , a civilian who had been working under contract for the cia in iraq mr passaro is awaiting trial in federal court in north carolina in connection with the june 21 , 2003 , death of a prisoner in afghanistan a day after being beaten during an interrogation the reviews come after the justice department s repudiation of an august 2002 legal opinion that had served as the foundation for rules that guided the cia in how far its officers and contractors could go in using coercive techniques to extract information for prisoners during interrogations some current and former intelligence officials have expressed concern that the repudiation undermined some of the legal authority that the bush administration had provided for the agency s role in detention and interrogation in public testimony last week , porter j goss , the director of central intelligence , declined to say how many cia reviews of possible misconduct involving prisoners were under way or when they might be completed but he told the senate intelligence committee that while the north carolina case was the only one to have been made public , a bunch of other cases were now under review by the inspector general what i ca n't tell you is how many more might come in the door , mr goss added mr goss , who took over in september , said that a report ordered by one of his predecessors had produced 10 recommendations or so involving interrogation and detention , and that about , i think , eight of those have been done
a plan by intelsat , announced yesterday , to purchase panamsat holding for 32 billion is the largest takeover in recent years in the fastconsolidating commercial satellite industry but it is unlikely to be the last there are still about three dozen satellite providers operating worldwide , which means there are too many players in a market that is no longer growing fast enough to sustain them all increasingly , a global network matters , too programmers like disney , cnn and others are expanding into asia , the middle east and beyond and need satellite operators that can beam their signals to all points on the globe panamsat had this in mind last month when it bought a satellite and two orbital slots from alcatel to help it expand further into europe , the middle east , africa and asia then there is the big threat from the operators of the world s transcontinental and transoceanic fiber networks these companies can zip bits and bytes around the world , often for far less than satellite operators to combat these lowcost providers , satellite companies need the size and scale to drive prices lower they also need to focus on their unique ability to offer highspeed data connections , video programming and phone service to developing countries where markets are just opening and where fiber networks are scarce to do that , they need a constellation of satellites that blanket not just wealthy markets in north america , europe and parts of asia , but also africa , the middle east and south america i think this is just a normal step going forward , said joseph r wright jr , the chief executive of panamsat we 're kind of following a normal evolution in our industry consolidation is not only necessary , but inevitable if intelsat s purchase of panamsat is approved , the new company would become the industry leader with 53 satellites , surpassing ses global of luxembourg , which has 35 satellites the only other company with more than 10 satellites is eutelsat , the european operator , which has 23 satellites the remaining companies are far smaller , which makes the likelihood of another large deal doubtful yet many smaller companies could help one of the big operators expand into new regions loral space and communications , which has four satellites across the globe , is likely to be involved in future mergers and acquisitions , according to industry analysts the company expects to come out of bankruptcy around oct 1 and be relisted on the nasdaq stock exchange immediately afterward it will also reemerge with little debt , something bernard l schwartz , the chairman of the company , said could be a big selling or buying point without significant debt on our balance sheet , and having equity , i'm hoping to actively participate in the market , he said intelsat and panamsat will not be out there to expand for quite a while that leaves opportunities for the rest of us new skies satellites of the netherlands is another company that some industry analysts say could become a takeover target the company has five satellites and , like panamsat and intelsat , is owned partly by private equity investors the blackstone group , in this case who want a return on their investment many small , regional operators are governmentowned and are unlikely to be spun off or sold but these companies are good candidates to form joint ventures , industry executives say still , none of the merger talks would be in earnest if demand for satellite services were not on the upswing growth in highdefinition broadcasting , internetbased programming and ondemand video services have buoyed satellite providers in north america , asia and europe the larger satellite providers expect demand for video services to grow as much as 10 percent this year the fundamentals are improving and it s being driven by things like highdefinition televisions , said todd mitchell , an industry analyst at kaufman brothers equity research the programmers are putting these products out there and you need more capacity for that telecommunications companies in developing countries are also expanding their phone and internet services and need ways to transport signals around the globe cheaply and the biggest client of them all , the united states government , is also leasing more satellite space to provide communications to afghanistan , iraq and elsewhere as always , the key to consolidation lies in the hands of regulators but in the united states , satellite companies are likely to face little resistance , industry analysts say the justice department has approved several large deals between wireless and landline companies in recent years , and they are likely to approve most satellite deals , too

moosic , pa , june 28 ryan howard is entering his prime on a field where three women are dressed as produce behind home plate are two human tomatoes and a husk of corn , preparing to sing the national anthem at first base , riper than all the rest , is the most celebrated slugger not yet in the big leagues he is still waiting to be harvested major league baseball has long been looking for the kind of power hitter who can take pitches and hit to the opposite field , who has been to college and been seasoned in the minor leagues , who can prove to young africanamerican athletes that basketball and football are not the only marquee options but now that such a player has actually arrived , now that he has chosen the diamond over the hardwood and college over the pros , now that he has turned 25 and dominated every minor league level , there seems to be no place for him while the phillies are at shea stadium , their most intriguing player waits in a minor league ballpark at the base of montage mountain , on the edge of the poconos , in the ready position the phillies say howard is a victim of circumstance , stuck behind first baseman jim thome and his sixyear , 85 million contract , which has three seasons remaining more specifically , howard may be a victim of his own talent while prospects in similar situations make for juicy trade bait this time of year , howard has become almost too valuable to deal the phillies do not necessarily need him , but they are understandably terrified of giving him up they have seen the 500foot home run he hit in batavia , ny , the shot that cleared the leftcenterfield scoreboard in reading , pa , and the blast that bounced off the batter s eye in clearwater , fla with every homer that howard hits this season onto the rock formations behind the outfield fence at scranton wilkesbarre s home park , he may become tougher to trade dealing legends , even when they are minor leaguers , is never an easy transaction so howard watches former teammates with inferior credentials being called up to the majors he gets phone calls from friends with trade rumors but hears none firsthand he is careful with what he says publicly , in part because his parents taught him to be polite , and in part because the trading deadline is a month away and he does not want to disturb a potential deal for me , it s all about getting up there , howard said i want an opportunity if it s with the phillies , that s great if not , that s ok , too i am just trying to stay the course and not get distracted someday , i think i 'll look back on this as a time of patience his perspective is further proof of his maturity howard is that rare player to hit 48 home runs in a professional season and start the next year in the minor leagues class aaa pitchers have greeted him like barry bonds , intentionally walking him to load the bases , working around him late in games such treatment is commonplace in the big leagues , but the minors are supposedly devoted to the development of young players to consistently pitch around a hitter in the international league is to defeat the purpose either howard is learning to become the next bonds or he is wasting his time his batting average is 369 and his onbase percentage is 470 , yet only northeast pennsylvania can fully appreciate the numbers when local little leaguers are allowed on the field at lackawanna county stadium as part of a promotion , the majority rush to howard s side when the red barons design advertisements , howard is the centerpiece next month , the team is giving out howard s bobblehead doll , whether he is around or not in philadelphia , howard is a talkradio phenomenon second only to terrell owens already this year , the phillies have switched howard to the outfield , moved him back to first base , called him up to the majors , then sent him down after he batted 214 in only 28 atbats stoking the debate further , howard and his agent faxed a formal trade request to the phillies when he was demoted out of spring training one column in the philadelphia daily news this month was headlined , free ryan howard the first paragraph compared howard s minor league assignment to the iran hostage crisis i know this is tough for the player , but it s good for the club , said mike arbuckle , the phillies' assistant general manager in charge of scouting and player development i wish we had the same situation at four other positions it s comforting to know ryan is sitting here if you move a guy like him , you have to get a lot back you probably want to send him to the other league so you do n't face him all the time and you probably want to get a player with a similar ceiling at a similar age , not a rentaplayer or a guy two years from free agency there are n't many guys in that category although howard believes he was major league ready last september , when he batted 282 in his first callup , the phillies maintain that he can benefit from another summer with scranton wilkesbarre they insist he can still improve his defense and enhance his patience at the plate but one scout who watched howard last week said that his only real weakness was hitting sharp breaking balls on his hands scores of 22yearolds have been promoted with far greater problems we stand by our request for a trade 100 percent , said larry reynolds , howard s agent he deserves to be playing but he will force the issue more by what he does on the field than what he says a quality kid like this is good for the game commissioner bud selig could not have mapped out a more inspiring course for a future superstar howard grew up in baseballcrazed st louis , learning the history of the sport at busch stadium he picked first base over power forward in high school , went to southwest missouri state and has played for five phillies affiliates , logging more than 1 , 800 atbats when the standard is about 1 , 500 if howard were not already in his mid20 s , wondering how many bigleague seasons his body will allow him to play , perhaps this delay would be easier to accept i certainly hope it does n't make young guys in the future think they should n't go to college and should start right away with their careers , said aj hinch , the red barons' catcher and a psychology major at stanford , who has played part of the past four major league seasons but i do n't think it will a guy like ryan is going to have plenty of time i just hope his time is soon not only does howard play the same position as thome , they are both lefthanded hitters , both 6 feet 4 inches , both built like outside linebackers and both point their bat dramatically at the pitcher s mound before they start their swings during spring training , thome adopted howard like a little brother , and even now , howard has such affection for thome that he refers to him as big thump but since thome is batting 215 this season with seven home runs and a bad back , he and howard are constantly being compared with one another while thome is a deadpull hitter against whom teams radically shift their defensive alignments , howard is arguably more potent to all fields he is strong enough in his wrists and forearms to swing inside out for home runs to left and leftcenter his annual salary is also about 14 million less than thome s , making him more appealing and easier to trade i 've managed in the minor leagues a long time , and ryan is the best power hitter i 've ever had , said gene lamont , the red barons' manager , who has been in professional baseball for 40 years there have been times this season when the expectations were such that he 'd hit a home run every time he came up the twin towns of scranton and wilkesbarre have learned to enjoy the show before it moves on to some large metropolitan area , never to return howard could be traded today , tomorrow or july 31 but he can never be erased from the 2005 team photo as a photographer arranged the red barons in the stands at lackawanna county stadium on monday afternoon , howard took his place at the back row , fourth from the right , wristband slid fashionably over his left elbow , looking like the biggest , oldest , coolest guy in a class picture that will be framed forever he put on the happiest face possible
president bush raised the country s hopes last month when he previewed a 15 billion initiative that would promote desperately needed reform in the american high school system the package laid out in the president s budget proposal touches on many of the right issues , but it is underfinanced and poorly conceived and dead on arrival in congress , which has signaled its intent to ignore crucial provisions of mr bush s proposal the white house , which failed to push for adequate funds for its last big education initiative , the no child left behind act , has only itself to blame for failing to do the necessary preparation before unveiling this big idea nevertheless , congress should understand what s at stake here as school reform grinds to a halt in washington , american students are falling further and further behind their peers in asia and europe , where universally accessible quality schools are producing highly skilled workers at a rate that far outstrips schools in the united states the traditional american high school , as conceived a century ago , was never meant to produce welleducated workers in the numbers required by today s economy remaking the system so american students catch up with their peers abroad will require several big changes the curriculum must become far more rigorous across the board , and that can happen only if teachers improve the schools must offer broadbased remedial instruction to help the eyepopping 70 percent of students who arrive at high school reading too poorly to absorb the complex subject matter they will be required to cover the system must also develop ways to ensure that students leave school with problemsolving and communication skills that will allow them to thrive in the information economy president bush wants to extend right into high school the testing requirements that are mandated for the lower grades under no child left behind this page has been second to none in supporting systematic testing , but talking about tests without first addressing all the things that are wrong with the current system is putting the cart before the horse mr bush has also proposed a package of academic interventions for struggling students that he would pay for mainly by killing off a 13 billion federally financed vocational education program this figure is far short of what s needed to renovate america s ailing high school system but the president s underlying point that many vocational education programs obstruct academic achievement is perfectly valid the lowend programs prepare students for lowskill jobs that no longer exist worst of all , they commonly become dumping grounds for poor and minority students , who are pushed through shop classes with no academics to speak of and then deposited on the street after graduating with meaningless diplomas shockingly , the typical american high school student earns more credits in vocational education than in either math or science the only way to justify keeping vocational programs is to make sure that they offer a sound academic grounding along with preparation for the new economy s highskill jobs , instead of just wood shop and fender pounding at the moment , however , some in congress would like to push in exactly the wrong way by exempting vocational programs from even the inadequate current academic standards many members of congress have gotten heat from their districts about the demands made by the current no child left behind standards , and getting them to push for further improvements in quality will be hard mr bush made a tactical error by failing to prepare the political ground in advance , but the game is not yet lost taking aim at vocational education is an excellent way to get high school reform off the ground but only if the bush administration will use its political muscle and go public with its case the opportunity will be missed if the president throws up his hands and slinks away
you might look past him as you sat across from him on the subway if you briefly paused to study his face , you might wonder about his life s story what have those eyes seen \? before turning to search the car for someone more interesting then , when you returned your gaze to his seat , he would be gone , assumed into the human blur of new york city that s the kind of man jack reimer was , from all accounts unassuming , unremarkable , among us like many of us , he was an immigrant born in ukraine in 1918 , he arrived at the port of new york in 1952 and settled on west 136th street he moved to brooklyn and became a united states citizen in 1959 like many of us , he worked his way up he landed his first job with one of the schrafft s restaurants that once were sprinkles on the new york sundae he cleaned the kitchen , and eventually was promoted to bartender by the mid1960 s , he was managing a schrafft s in manhattan you may have even eaten there after that , he operated a wise potato chip franchise that served lower manhattan he had a wife , two children , and some grandchildren he often read the bible he liked to dance and in 1992 , when he was retired and living in putnam county , agents of his adopted country called to say that they wanted to talk to him about his years as a nazi mr reimer , then 73 , took the subway to meet with justice department lawyers in lower manhattan , his old potato chip territory he described himself as a kind of accidental nazi a soldier in the russian army who was taken prisoner by the germans in 1941 , then transferred to the notorious trawniki training camp in poland he was assigned to the wachmannschaften , or guard forces wearing uniforms and often carrying guns , these men helped to liquidate jewish ghettos and to guard extermination and labor camps mr reimer , who rose quickly in the ranks , said that while he occasionally trained the guards , he worked mostly as an office clerk the fivehour interview eventually turned to a morning in either 1941 or 1942 , when several dozen jews were shot dead in a pit near trawniki mr reimer claimed that he arrived late to the massacre because he had overslept but after some prodding , he recalled that one man , lying among the dead , pointed to his own head a soundless request to be put out of his misery fearing the wrath of german soldiers , mr reimer said , he shot once at the man , but waffled on whether he had killed him but after you shot he was no longer pointing to his head , was he \? he was asked his answer no eli m rosenbaum , now the director of the justice department s office of special investigations , helped to question mr reimer that day in may 1992 i recall thinking how bizarre that this man came by subway , and was probably seen by any number of holocaust survivors and children of holocaust survivors , he said none of them could have imagined whom they shared their subway car with mr rosenbaum immediately filed a lawsuit to strip mr reimer of his citizenship , the first step toward his deportation , on the grounds that he had provided assistance in persecution mr reimer countered by retaining ramsey clark , the attorney general during the johnson administration a 13year legal battle ensued mr clark maintained that his client had persecuted no one , and was himself a victim of world war ii mr rosenbaum countered that such a position was an affront to the war s true victims that mr reimer provided support to the nazi ss , participated in the liquidation of the jewish ghettos in warsaw and czestochowa and killed that man meanwhile , mr reimer told so many conflicting stories that he sometimes seemed to be wishing himself into another version of events for example , he later denied shooting the man in the pit he never allowed his family to attend the court proceedings , where holocaust survivors sometimes heckled him he quoted the ten commandments a lot and when mr clark informed him in 2002 that his citizenship had been revoked , he said oh , my four months ago , mr reimer exhausted his appeals , and the government began proceedings for his deportation we had reached an agreement in principle that he was going to give us the relief we sought , mr rosenbaum said he was going back to germany but the proceedings ended last month when word arrived that a man who had sat among us potato chip salesman , grandfather , and old nazi had died he was 86
investing enough for college is the sort of thing that is within the reach of just about anyone anyone with a sevendigit trust fund or an oil well in their backyard there s something about signing that first tuition check that generates a special terror deep in the gut even if you have carefully shepherded your investments after all , a conservative calculation shows that the cost of sending a young person to a leading college for four years is 275 million \( that was a little joke or , as your college student will soon explain to you , an excursion into hyperbole \) let s try again estimating the cost of college is a little like the game you may have played when you got your first calculator see if you can make the number go so high that a little e pops up on the screen i never learned what the e stood for but i can tell you with assurance that four years of higher education adds up to , roughly , e and if your young scholar requires a fifth year to complete undergraduate studies , that cost will double a jump attributable , for the most part , to the rising cost of beer \( hyperbole again ! beer does n't rise in price nearly as fast as college tuition does \) the cost of the most expensive private colleges , including room and board and expenses like books , the absolutely essential electronics , transportation and all the rest , is edging toward 200 , 000 for four years but about 70 percent of students at all fouryear schools , public and private , pay less than 8 , 000 a year for tuition and fees state and federal financial aid can help , as well as college scholarships and aid from local institutions still , for many families , saying that college only costs 8 , 000 a year , even without adding in the extras , is a little like saying that buying a ticket to orbit the earth on a soyuz rocket costs only 20 million it s no big deal if you 've got the money an investor may be able to match the tuition growth rate of 6 to 8 percent a year by choosing a good mutual fund an index fund may do the job but then you 'd only be keeping pace with the annual increases a family still has to come up with the base cost of tuition , which , some planners say , requires socking away about a thousand dollars a month from birth for each child if he had used the paying for college defense , maybe l dennis kozlowski , the highrolling chief executive of tyco international who was recently convicted of looting the company , would never need to consider asking martha stewart for advice on how to give a prison cell a more open and welcoming appearance that s more sympathetic than a shower curtain , said roy weitz , the publisher of fundalarmcom , the mutual fund watchdog mr kozlowski , of course , spent 6 , 000 on a shower curtain that was financed by tyco shareholders in our little family , we 've put money away like clockwork for the last 15 years in carefully selected stock funds but those funds took such a spectacular dive after 2000 that we 're wishing we had done something more productive with the money , like burning the dollar bills for heat at the same time that our investments were seesawing , we noticed an economic trend that had none of the sickening swoops and dropoffs of our own meager hoard college tuition was moving upward at an inexorable rate every year it s notching up 6 percent , mr weitz said they have a straight line that s going to infinity and you have a graph of your returns that looks like a mountain range colleges , it appears , have an unbeatable annuity that consistently outstrips inflation , and it s you there is , of course , a way to get into that game invest in college yourself some people already know this , and they buy stock in companies like the apollo group , which runs the forprofit university of phoenix but my modest proposal goes further the nation s leading universities should issue shares to the public ipo s could increase their budgets and give their alumni a way to show their team spirit with their pocketbooks and any university president who has had to deal with the endless nattering of the faculty senate and with enraged alums who want to discuss the details of the football team s running offense is more than prepared to deal with a corporate gadfly like evelyn y davis as an alternative , i want to live like the universities do hello , boss \? i demand a 6 percent pay increase every year give me more and i 'll name a room in my house after you
washington , june 3 the united states criticized four of its closest allies in the middle east on friday , saying kuwait , qatar , saudi arabia and the united arab emirates are doing little if anything to stop forced labor and other forms of modern slavery within their borders the four countries are among 14 tier iii nations that the state department said had a serious problem with trafficking in persons and made little or no effort to control it , despite prodding from the united states citation as a tier iii country can trigger economic penalties trafficking in human beings is nothing less than a modern form of slavery , said secretary of state condoleezza rice , speaking at a news conference introducing the government s fifth annual trafficking in persons report none of the four middle eastern countries were on the government s list of problem nations last year though saudi arabia was listed in 2001 and 2002 the government decided this year to focus its attention on forced labor , the primary problem in the four middle eastern states in saudi arabia , said john r miller , the state department s senior adviser on trafficking , we have domestic workers being brought in from many countries into domestic servitude , child beggars , a lot of beatings , reports of beatings and rape very difficult to get shelter , no convictions slave trafficking burst onto the world stage in the mid1990 s , when thousands of women from the former soviet union , attracted by job offers in europe , were forced to work as prostitutes once they arrived these russian women began working the streets of major european capitals in the united states during the late 1990 s , several notorious farmlabor servitude cases in florida and forced prostitution cases involving hundreds of mexican and thai women caught the attention of the clinton administration , just as europe was urging washington to get involved in 2000 , congress passed the trafficking victim protection act , which set out new penalties for slave traffickers and required the state department to publish an annual report on slave trafficking worldwide the department vigorously opposed the report provision officials said they did not want to do research for another annual report , on top of the human rights and drug trafficking reports , and did not believe nations found to be out of compliance should be penalized automatically the bill was amended to make the sanctions subject to the president s discretion and since 2003 , when the sanction provision took effect , only two countries venezuela and equatorial guinea have been cited under the law , no decisions on whether to sanction the 14 nations cited this year can be made before september to give the nations time to improve their records , mr miller said the other nations include bolivia , cambodia , ecuador , jamaica , sudan , togo and venezuela also listed were cuba , myanmar and north korea , nations that are mentioned in almost every government list of problem states last year , the department listed only 10 problem states but the first report , in 2001 , listed 23 saudi arabia is a key american ally and oil supplier whose leader , crown prince abdullah , visited president bush at his texas ranch in april kuwait and the united arab emirates , along with qatar , are also allies , and the united states maintains an important military base in qatar the criticisms of the four countries were similar all four nations , the report says , imported workers from the region , from the middle east and asia and then effectively enslaved them some foreign women who migrate legally to kuwait as domestic workers , the report says , are subsequently abused by their employers or coerced into situations of debt bondage or involuntary servitude , the legal term for slavery in the united arab emirates , women are trafficked from many nations for the purpose of sexual exploitation saudi arabia , the report adds , discourages victims from complaining the government offers no legal aid to foreign workers , the report says , and does not otherwise assist them in using the saudi criminal justice system to bring exploiters to justice if a victim chooses to file a complaint , he or she is not allowed to work none of the embassies of the four countries responded to requests for comment the government was particularly critical of kuwait , qatar and the united arab emirates for allowing young children to be held in captivity and used as jockeys in camel races , a multimillion dollar activity in the persian gulf states tiny children , some 3 or 4 years old , are prized , and they are underfed to keep their weight down , the report notes some boys as young as 6 months old were reported kidnapped and sold to traffickers and raised to become camel jockeys others , it adds , were sold by their parents to traffickers recently , it adds , one fell off his camel and was trampled to death in kuwait , it says , some have been thrown from the camels they rode and suffered serious neurological damage most no longer remember where they came from the united states estimates that about 800 , 000 people are trafficked against their will between nations each year , and that many hundreds of thousands more are enslaved within their own nations the government also estimates that about 15 , 000 people are trafficked to the united states each year that estimate has fallen since the central intelligence agency issued the first one in 2000 then it was estimated that as many as 50 , 000 people were trafficked to the united states from a dozen foreign countries each year
bishkek , kyrgyzstan , march 24 protesters alleging corruption , repression and electoral fraud forced the longtime president of this central asian country to flee his palace on thursday , the third time a government of a former soviet republic has been toppled in a popular uprising in a year and a half president askar akayev and his family fled bishkek , the kyrgyz capital , after crowds at a large opposition rally seized control of the presidential palace and began looting it kyrgyzstan s parliament elected a former opposition lawmaker , ishenbai kadyrbekov , as the country s interim president it was unclear whether the decision was legally binding , in part because of uncertainty over whether mr akayev , whose whereabouts were unknown , had stepped down other opposition leaders were appointed to senior posts in an interim government , whose members met to discuss keeping order and conducting a new presidential vote the events in this mountainous country of five million on china s border , where both russia and the united states have air bases , follows similar uprisings in georgia and ukraine the reverberations are likely to be especially felt in the most powerful former soviet republic , russia news analysis , page a8 scenes of protesters calling for the government s ouster highlight the contrast with russia , where president vladimir v putin is strengthening state control , and raise questions about russia s continuing influence in its former territories the apparent fall of the government here could also shake other authoritarian regimes in the region , including belarus , tajikistan and kazakhstan no one expected it would happen so fast , balbek tulobayev , a government official who was close to the opposition , said after protesters had occupied the palace waves of protest and discontent in this mostly muslim country have been building and spreading for several weeks , particularly since the disputed runoff elections earlier this month anger over the vote , together with rising discontent at deteriorating living conditions , especially in the poorer and more religious south , fueled what has been a largely disorganized yet peaceful opposition movement the takeover on thursday began when two protest marches , held in the face of threats by the government that it would use force to quell unrest , converged on the white house , the main government building where mr akayev had his office the streams of demonstrators marching from different parts of the capital filled the main square in front of the building , where organizers said they had initially planned to press their demand for mr akayev s resignation at first the demonstrators were hesitant , eyeing the police ringed round the building then , a few protesters began throwing stones and the police officers quickly vanished some of the demonstrators entered the presidential palace , emerging at one of the palace s windows , arms raised and fists closed in a sign of victory , prompting roars of support from the crowd in the compound outside inside the building , looting began the huge entrance hall was littered with debris and other parts of the building had been ransacked in the small woodpaneled office on the seventh floor where mr akayev ruled for nearly 15 years , protesters gave speeches and posed for pictures while others pocketed souvenirs a senior civil servant in a blue suit and tie stood in a corner of the office the president was here until the crowds gathered , he said tell the world that when he left , he gave orders that no weapons should be used , even though there are plenty in the cellar none of the police officers visible in the square on thursday were armed a doctor at the main trauma hospital said that no more than 40 people had been injured , none critically kurmanbek bakiyev , one of the opposition leaders and a former prime minister , called for order looting took place elsewhere in the city , too , with people converging on a shopping center said to be controlled by the akayev family near the main square , carting away groceries and furniture there appeared to be no moves by the authorities to stop the looters mr akayev , the president , had apparently fled the capital after hours of negotiations , carried out by cellphone , between the protesters and his daughter bermet the protesters were calling on mr akayev to formally resign , but in the end he left without doing so , denying the new authorities an orderly transition of power he and his family left the presidential compound by helicopter and headed for the nearby russian air base , which they also later left , said mr akayev s former chief of staff , rafjan jeenbekov their final destination was not immediately clear mr akayev s rule had started on a promising note a worldclass physicist and president of the kyrgyz academy of sciences , mr akayev had made a name for himself in the last soviet parliament as an eloquent proponent of reform when the kyrgyz soviet power structure collapsed in 1990 , the new post of president was offered to a respected novelist , chingiz aitmatov he turned it down and recommended mr akayev , who , alone among his central asian peers , went on to embrace democratic methods but for the last decade , poverty grew in the south while the north , where mr akayev has his roots , gained a small measure of prosperity meanwhile , the president s family grew wealthy and mr akayev himself accumulated more and more political power press freedoms were curbed , charges of election fraud swelled and mr akayev s popularity sank to the point where he is now being blamed , some say unfairly , for the effects of the soviet collapse , which was particularly painful for kyrgyzstan the takeovers of government buildings in the past weeks , until now mainly focused on the south , have been marked by little resistance from the authorities in most cases , the police have melted away in the face of protesters that lack of enthusiasm to defend a government that had come to be known simply as the family has raised questions about the stability of neighboring kazakhstan , whose population is ethnically close and whose governance has also drawn charges of generalized corruption , nepotism and voterigging in bishkek , after nightfall the streets were filled with people and the sounds of celebratory honking southerners , in their typically brightly colored clothes , lay down to sleep in a park near the white house , some roasting meat over campfires looking tired and happy , they said they had come from jalalabad , where the uprising began march 10
when morgan stanley s 10 , 000plus retail brokers dialed into the monday morning strategy call last week , they were treated to a surprise guest speaker who had some urgent advice these two firms have never come together , said their chief executive , john j mack , referring to the dean witter and morgan stanley factions of the divided investment bank and i promise you we will tear down these silos he paused , wondering aloud if he might offend any of the firm s 54 , 000 employees then , using a vulgar phrase for obsequious behavior , mr mack warned his brokers , and anyone else at the firm , to cease buttering up their new chief and their other bosses such conduct will not work in this firm , he added mixing the ribald with the hortatory , the remarks were a call to arms that typified mr mack s management style , setting him apart from more restrained predecessors more than that , though , they demonstrated the extent to which he has thrown down the gauntlet in the firm s struggling retail unit , challenging its muchmaligned brokers to either produce or seek work elsewhere starting yesterday , underperforming morgan stanley brokers began receiving pink slips as mr mack works toward his goal of culling 1 , 000 of the least productive of them by the end of the year brokers with at least eight years' experience and producing less than 225 , 000 in commissions and fees will lose their jobs , according to executives involved in the process his tart words , combined with the cuts , underlined mr mack s intention to break with the dean witter legacy of focusing on main street investors in this vein , the firm announced this week that bruce alonso , a senior dean witter retail executive sanctioned by regulators in 2003 for his role in offering incentives for brokers to sell morgan stanley funds , would retire at the end of the year but as mr mack zeroes in on the retail unit s woes , he remains undecided on whom he should pick to revive it in recent weeks , he has had initial conversations with at least three outside executives about running the individual investor group , people who have been briefed on these discussions said among those mr mack has had discussions with are james p gorman , the former retail chief at merrill lynch , and two senior brokerage executives at ubs , mark b sutton and marten hoekstra for mr mack , finding a new retail head who satisfies both outside investors and his brokerage troops will be his first significant executive challenge the profit troubles of the brokerage division were a flashpoint for criticism of the former chief executive , philip j purcell , and shareholders are clamoring for a bigname hire , an executive with a track record and a proven ability to build and develop a retail brokerage business but in opting for such a senior outside manager , mr mack would have to address the unsettled status of his own executive suite zoe cruz , copresident under mr purcell , has been named acting president by mr mack , a title that raised questions about her longterm status ms cruz s position has received a shortterm boost , as it appears certain that none of the five senior executives who left the firm after a management shakeup in march will return but it is also likely that some of the candidates would prefer to report to mr mack as chief executive rather than ms cruz , a seasoned fixedincome practitioner with no retail experience so hiring an outsider could influence mr mack s thinking with regard to his plans for ms cruz accordingly , there has been some speculation in the firm that mr mack might select an internal candidate to sidestep the tricky issue of introducing a hardcharging executive from a competing investment bank into morgan stanley s prickly and sensitive culture and while mr mack has spoken positively about raymond a harris , another dean witter veteran who has been named interim president of the individual investor group , he seems an unlikely choice to take on such a charged task for the long haul of the candidates , mr gorman seems to be the most logical choice in fact , he was approached about the job by john h schaefer , the previous head of the retail unit in june , amid the turmoil over mr purcell , but opted not to pursue it , according to people briefed on the discussions mr gorman , 47 , is a former mckinsey consultant who for the last five years has presided over merrill s vast fleet of more than 14 , 000 brokers during this time , as morgan stanley s brokers struggled to remain profitable , the private client division at merrill has had growth in margins and profits as the firm focused on attracting more feebased , highnetworth client accounts a cool , precise australian with a formal manner that has not always resonated with merrill s brokers , mr gorman took on a new position in june as head of strategy and corporate acquisitions , reporting directly to e stanley o'neal , merrill lynch s chief executive but the move , while intended to give him more exposure to merrill s institutional business , has left him with an impressive title but no business to run , a state of being that ambitious executives tend to dislike mr sutton is chairman for the americas at ubs , while mr hoekstra oversees the firm s brokers in the united states longtime painewebber executives who came up through the ranks as branch managers , they have more experience in the field than mr gorman , and both have been credited for attracting wealthier clients as well as the success of the ubs painewebber merger mr gorman , mr sutton and mr hoekstra declined to comment but for mr mack , or for any outside executive , making the break from dean witter s past will be painful i was shocked there was no severance or anything , said jan tyler , 54 , a broker for 19 years in the firm s denver office who was told by her branch manager yesterday that she had a halfhour to gather her things and leave ms tyler , who describes herself as an average producer , has already filed a complaint with the equal employment opportunity commission did n't it occur to them , she said , that they are knocking people off that could be valuable to them \?

singapore , monday , july 4 international olympic committee members warily stepped out of elevators , looking both ways for solicitous representatives from the cities bidding to be host for the 2012 olympics who might be lurking in the lobby soldiers who look barely old enough to drive were pacing outside the doors , toting machine guns and appearing impervious to the sweltering heat the mayor of paris , bertrand delano , huddled with advisers in the lobby bar , chain smoking the entire scene paused as a huge security detail ushered prime minister tony blair of britain through the doors and into the elevator , a burst of camera flashes lighting his way the frantic world of olympic bidding has descended on this citystate in southeast asia , and a vote by ioc members wednesday will decide what many consider the most hotly contested olympics ever with new york , paris , london , madrid and moscow vying to win the 2012 games by all accounts , there are far more undecided ioc members than usual this time around , making all the posturing and wooing necessary , and endlessly intriguing as is their habit , ioc members rarely tip their hands , addressing the race as evasively as possible most say the outcome will be extremely close , with voting going several rounds before a winner is determined it has become an outsized civic beauty pageant i 've never seen a contest like it , said kevan gosper of australia , an ioc member since 1977 it has got to be the greatest peacetime competition between five of the greatest and most historic cities in history , not just in olympic history the scene swirls around two adjacent hotel lobbies , at raffles and swiss tel , with their various restaurants and bars , ringed by armed soldiers and metal detectors , and occasionally preoccupied with the arrival of a major dignitary mr blair created the biggest stir sunday , with mayor michael r bloomberg of new york opting for an unpublicized arrival in his private jet but by wednesday , dignitaries like president jacques chirac of france , queen sofia of spain , prime minister mikhail fradkov of russia and senator hillary rodham clinton , democrat of new york , will have caused their own commotion , as will the sports superstars david beckham and muhammad ali the gathering has attracted about 1 , 500 members of the news media , outnumbering the 116 ioc members by more than 10 to 1 most of the work of courting votes , however , happens out of plain view , although ioc members brave enough to venture through the lobby are met quickly by representatives from bid cities in the evening , the mingling moves to the bars and restaurants nearby but the task is more complicated than simply finding favor the voting goes by rounds if one city has not received a majority of votes after the first round , the city receiving the lowest number of votes is eliminated the rounds continue until one city receives a majority ioc members from a country that has a city competing for the bid cannot vote until after their city is eliminated i do n't get lobbied much , said craig reedie , an ioc member from britain it s my goal not to vote but voters have to think beyond their first choice , which may be knocked out quickly nyc2012 , new york s bid committee , has a delegation of more than 200 people here the bid officials have worked to make new york the second choice of a lot of voters , even lobbying ioc members they believed were favoring another city daniel l doctoroff , new york s bid founder and the deputy mayor for economic development , says new york can gain steam if it survives into the later rounds paris is expected to have the most firstround votes , but it may be less aggressive about picking up votes from members committed to another city my gut view is that most people know what they 're going to do in the first round , said sebastian coe , a twotime gold medalist in the 1 , 500 meters who is london s bid leader but it s a bit like i knew how i was going to start most races for the first 30 or 40 yards , but then you were n't always able to factor everything in yes , i have a number of scenarios in my mind what could happen , but that will unravel anyway the runup to this vote has helped shape its ambiguity ioc rules now forbid members to visit bid cities as a way to prevent the kind of votebuying that resulted in the salt lake city scandal , in which some ioc members received bribes and special favors for their votes on the 2002 winter games bid leaders are allowed to approach ioc members only at iocsanctioned events , so the lobbying has been contained to organized settings i think that the rules have resulted in people being both more cautious and waiting until the latest moment , mr gosper said none of the cities' bid officials admit to taking anything for granted paris officials often say that they do not believe their city is the frontrunner madrid s bid leader , feliciano mayoral , insists his city received the top marks from the evaluation commission , although most interpreted the review for paris as the best new york officials are still questioned about the possibility that new york s state assembly speaker , sheldon silver , would kill a second stadium plan , forcing them to rebut the idea that their olympic stadium hangs in perpetual limbo mr coe trumpets london s momentum that is not a hard claim to back up considering that the bid had little public support even within britain until mr coe took over a year ago and gave it an aggressive posture the london bid will require a huge urban renewal project , even more ambitious than new york s now that the west side makeover has been scrapped they provide a stark contrast to paris s modest building plans singapore has added its own particular flair to this process on saturday , with ioc members beginning to arrive and bid cities jockeying for access , the country unfurled a fascinating distraction what appeared to be a significant portion of the singapore military paraded through the streets , with legions of soldiers , dozens of tanks driven by men in full camouflage , and trucks carrying missiles the display ended with a flyover and a 21gun salute the event was one of seven practice sessions for a national day parade in august while the rehearsal was taking over singapore s streets , new york s bid leaders were forced to walk through a maze of underground malls to reach their scheduled news conference they emerged from the crowded string of stores joking about the prospect of manhattan needing to stage seven practice runs for all of its parades nyc2012 , however , has repeatedly rehearsed for its big moment wednesday , when it makes a 45minute presentation before the ioc membership the presentation is being choreographed down to the minute , although it is not being directed by the filmmaker steven spielberg , contrary to a rumor reported in a local newspaper that rumor captivated even the french filmmaker luc besson , who is directing paris s effort mr besson declared spielberg his hero to lose in front of him will be an honor , he said to win in front of him will be a super honor there will be no mr spielberg , but plenty of others will swoop through the hotels , where the entertainment on parade needs no hollywood stagecraft a prime minister s entrance here or there will do
hempstead , ny , nov 25 curtis martin stood in the field , ankle deep in wild grass , and it was as if he were back in the living room of the rapper dr dre martin had a cousin who worked for dr dre , a k a andre young , in the early 1990 s , which is how martin , then a teenager , came to spend a weekend with dr dre in los angeles dr dre lived outside the city in a 4 , 000squarefoot , twostory tudorstyle house that seemed preposterously opulent to martin , who was being reared by his mother , rochella , in lowincome housing in pittsburgh martin , the veteran jets running back , remembered hearing that dr dre had bought the house for 25 million and thinking that it was an outlandish sum of money he remembered standing in the creamwhite living room , on carpet so soft it swallowed his feet , and telling himself that somehow , someway , he too would live surrounded by such elegance when i stood in that living room , martin said , something in me knew that i could be as successful and have a home like that i did n't actually know how it would occur , but i knew it was something i could do last year , when martin stood on a parcel of land that was for sale on long island , it kind of brought me back to that moment , he said for roughly what dr dre s tudor castle had cost , martin acquired five acres of dirt he figured his dream house would be taking shape by now but a year later , he has yet to hire an architect or a builder i just decided to wait , he said building a house is a huge distraction the house is on hold until martin is done playing football it is perhaps telling that he is no closer to breaking ground on the project now than he was last year a season after leading the league in rushing , martin is averaging 34 yards a carry through 10 games , he has 615 yards rushing at the same point last year , he had 1 , 072 yards martin s 11th pro season has been a sisyphean struggle he has five touchdowns , but none in the last 10 quarters he has an achy right knee that may require surgery after the season \( martin , 32 , chooses to keep most things , but especially injuries , to himself \) ask him about retiring , and all he will say is , i 've thought about one day it 'll happen his teammates say they have no idea what martin plans to do after this season curt keeps things pretty close to the vest , center kevin mawae said martin is the player who never speaks in the huddle , who fills pages at a time in journals , who would rather observe a party than be at the center of it he is the son who gave his father a furnished condominium with a closet full of clothes even though his father , curtis martin sr , had abandoned the family when he was 3 he is the son who insisted that his mother help him fix up the condo because he wanted to help her work through her bitterness toward his father because of martin , his father got a new place to live and his mother wound up with a new lease on happiness my mother being as happy as she is , that s my greatest accomplishment ever , martin said can you see why he is the first person his teammates seek out when they have a problem \? martin is like dr phil , except he never broadcasts anything i love to listen , martin said i'm a great secret keeper he is straight with his teammates he tells them , things i 've done are probably worse than anything you 've probably ever come across , so i have no room to judge anybody he knows the extreme images that those words may conjure martin s grandmother was stabbed to death in a home invasion , and he has seen friends shot to death beyond that , he chooses not to elaborate as long as he is playing football , he will not invite distractions a lot of people do not appreciate the depths of martin s discipline they think he must be lucky to have lasted 11 years in the nfl , that he is a freak of nature to have won the rushing title at 31 they do not see martin s monastic devotion to football jerald sowell , the jets fullback whom martin runs behind , said that during games , martin is so focused it is almost as if he is in a trance it is interesting that martin used almost the same words to describe what he saw as a teenager when he watched dr dre at work there was a certain way he bobbed his head to the music where you knew he was really into it , martin said , like you could tell he was thinking , 'how can i bring the best out of this song \? ' football is not martin s calling , it is his penance for a wayward childhood every year that he plays brings him closer to absolution jock is the last thing that i am , martin said football for me was a way to not end up dead possibly you have to consider , i see things from the standpoint of having a second life , literally i'm in the nfl now , away from all the things that harmed my life before i 've committed myself to football for these years i'm able to play it that requires a lot of things , a lot of discipline mentally , emotionally , spiritually the twobedroom condominium martin repairs to at the end of every day is dominated by soothing golds and soft browns it has the feel of a man on a metaphysical journey it s like a men s spa , said mawae , who used to live in the same building laughing , martin said when people come in , they say , 'i just want to go to sleep' it is so relaxing , so peaceful my home is really a reflection of me martin said he was in a good place , even if the jets \( 28 \) were going nowhere i have to say i'm a very happy man , he said when i say happy , i mean , like , i'm at peace i'm really at peace about myself and my life
with the lack of adequate music education in schools today , home remedies are sorely needed and valuable ones are at hand , perhaps none more so than leonard bernstein s young people s concerts with the new york philharmonic released last fall for home video in a ninedvd set from kultur international more than merely educational , they are immensely engaging and entertaining , even for the hardened listener but increasingly , there are other remedies , some of them also involving bernstein deutsche grammophon has just released an attractive fivecd set , leonard bernstein the 1953 american decca recordings it offers five standard symphonies in performances with the new york stadium symphony orchestra \( aka the stadium concerts symphony orchestra actually , the new york philharmonic , as it used to play in summer at lewisohn stadium \) , recorded at carnegie hall each symphony has an extended themebytheme commentary by bernstein these commentaries were recorded in the mid50 s for the forbiddingly named musicappreciation records , an offshoot of the bookofthemonth club , when the club took over these decca recordings in most cases , bernstein , using a piano as well as excerpts from the recordings , provides not only an analysis but an argument that dvorak s new world symphony says more about his bohemia than about the united states , or that tchaikovsky s path tique , though maligned in some academic circles , is indeed thoroughly symphonic in structure most amusing is bernstein s 1957 defense of schumann as orchestrator , with a recording of the second symphony the problem , he suggests , lies not with schumann but with conductors who fail to balance the instruments and sections properly , unlike you know who he ends triumphantly , evidently confident that the matter has been settled once and for all to this day , however , though many of us agree with bernstein , it has not another new deutsche grammophon set , on eight cd s , lorin maazel complete early berlin philharmonic recordings , 195762 , offers a broader swath of mostly romantic works there is nothing overtly educational here beyond a performance of britten s young person s guide to the orchestra , performed by a ringer , the french national radio orchestra , with mr maazel conducting and \( ever so archly \) narrating in terms of repertory , this is a veritable starter kit for anyone approaching classical music fresh , and by and large a good one in a few instances , it takes me back to my own belated start mr maazel s 1961 recording of mendelssohn s reformation symphony was my introduction both to mr maazel and to the work returning to it now , after having heard so many maazel interpretations of other works since and having found so many of them mannered if not perverse , made me wonder whether they would have sounded more palatable had they , too , been my first experiences of the music but no , there is in fact a winning freshness and spontaneity to many of these early performances , especially of the fizzier repertory schubert s symphonies \( nos 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 and 8 \) as well as mendelssohn s italian and reformation symphonies a notable exception is music from prokofiev s romeo and juliet , with painfully fussy moments mr maazel s complete recording of the work with the cleveland orchestra from 1973 has much more freedom and flow it is in fact one of the great recordings of all time bernstein also grew more idiosyncratic and often slower over the decades his early recordings here , despite a few interpretive excrescences , exude a vibrancy and a life that were sometimes missing in later years with both conductors , it is revelatory in good ways , generally to return to the beginnings of what we now know to have been great careers what s more , there are several close comparisons to be made between the two , in symphonies by beethoven \( bernstein s third , maazel s fifth and sixth \) , brahms \( maazel s third , bernstein s fourth \) and tchaikovsky \( maazel s fourth , bernstein s sixth \) and it may just be that mr maazel s brahms makes a better case for bernstein s refutation of the outdated notion of brahms as a dull , dry , thick , impotent , uninventive example of selfinflated mediocrity than does bernstein s own it s always nice to have preconceptions shattered , and the opportunities here are rich
