facing up to the big screen a fresh set of statistics shows that amid much publicity about electronic delivery , home video via tape and the vcr is not only growing , but is more than holding its own against movies in theaters and on payperview television the findings are from a new study by veronis , suhler associates , a new york investment bank that specializes in the communications business the figures show that last year americans spent 12 billion to rent or buy videos , and 49 billion at the movie box office the number of tape rentals went from 337 billion in 1991 to 358 billion in 1992 rentals for each household with a vcr were 495 , or under one a week , which is up a bit from last year but significantly below the peak 571 figure reached in 1987 , when renting movies was relatively new to many people movie revenues were up slightly in 1992 , but theater admissions fell to under a billion for only the second time in the last decade the veronis , suhler study blames the economy , among other factors americans , the report says , are very price conscious when it comes to entertainment last year , the average rental price of a movie on tape was 230 the average price in a theater was 505 and the cost of a film on payperview television was 435 in 1992 , the average vcr household spent 16575 on videos 11391 on rentals and 5184 on purchases the study predicts that both figures will increase by several dollars over the next five years despite projected increases in the cost of electronic delivery and payperview the study also says that sales are growing faster than rentals , though sales now bring in only about half as much revenue \( 37 billion to 82 billion \) the average retail purchase price fell from 60 in 1982 to 1415 in 1992 families in mind a key word in

naples , nov 5 it s voting season here , and everywhere the neapolitans look they are being offered a choice for mayor a neofascist or an excommunist or a candidate from one of the many hybrid tickets reflecting italy s confusionofthehour underlying the election on nov 21 , though , the question is not so much who will govern the city but whether it can be governed at all \? some might say the question applies to all of italy as it struggles to right itself after 20 months of scandal that has tainted virtually all its institutions , discredited its political class and business elite and deepened the divisions between north and south this place , though , is in a league of its own city is bankrupt as things stand right now , naples has no city council because too many councilors are under suspicion of corruption the city is also bankrupt , with 15 billion in unpayable debts the buses , when they arrive , crawl at an average of 13 miles an hour in the city s snarled traffic the government in rome has been forced to send a special commissioner , almost a viceroy , to run the city until a new council is voted into office under new rules permitting the direct election of a mayor the job is not an easy one the number of people formally registered as unemployed is 350 , 000 , around half the work force in this city of 11 million people schools and hospitals do n't work the traffic lights usually do n't work either , and when they do , they cause irritation , bemusement and comment in the cafes , but generally do not cause drivers to stop the water is polluted , and earlier this year , so was the milk camorra holds sway as if that were not enough to daunt any candidate , naples is the fief of the camorra , a deeprooted local version of the mafia whose 42 clan bosses are not especially interested in turning their haven of extortion , narcotics and cigarette smuggling into the world s bestrun city the drama of naples is that to change the way it is run , you need to change the entire socioeconomic structure , said aldo masullo , a wellknown leftwing philosopher here but changing the socioeconomic pattern is beyond the power of any administration amato lamberti , a leader of the city s greens environmental group , concurs , saying , the forces against change outnumber the forces in favor of it mayoral votes will also take place on nov 21 in palermo , rome , genoa and a host of smaller places that will give some clues about what italians are thinking about their political future after all the corruption and scandal mussolini is running here , though , the vote has a particular piquancy one of the candidates for mayor , a neofascist running on the italian social movement ticket , is alessandra mussolini , granddaughter of the dictator recent opinion surveys show her running second to an excommunist candidate , antonio basolino , and slowly closing the gap in street campaigns , miss mussolini has promised to rebuild our city , and her main aim , she said in an interview , is to create a strong communal machine to improve the threadbare services , throw corrupt politicians into jail and begin to redress social patterns that mean that there are a lot of rich people and a lot of poor people with no one in the middle the uphill job will be as steep as the city s byways naples , a blend of culture and crime , has never been an easily governed city , or a simple one its university dates to 1224 , its musical conservatory to 1537 the opera house , the san carlo , which was built in 1737 , is itay s biggest equally , though , said mr lamberti , who also heads an independent study group on organized crime in the city , naples has been the haunt of the camorra since the early 19th century two cities of naples to understand this city , you always have to remember that there are two cities , mr lamberti said in an interview there s a modern naples , with schools , universities , research centers then there s the second naples , which is two degrees hotter and two centuries behind the distinction by temperature refers to the fact that wealthy neapolitans live in the cooler city heights , while the poor inhabit the tangles of back streets below , where the camorra holds sway the distinction by centuries , mr lamberti said , refers to the improvised lives of the poor in the dickensian alleys of the spanish quarter , the oldest part of naples we have onethird of the population that has never had a regular job , professor masullo said , describing the city as a society where people live off other people and that functions for rich and poor alike through hidden networks of patronage and protection much of that protection comes from the camorra the camorra fulfills two functions , mr lamberti said it keeps the two cities apart , and it insures the survival of the subproletariat through the creation of illegal jobs thus , he said , up to 100 , 000 people live from illegal jobs guaranteed by the camorra even a pursesnatcher works under the protection of the camorra , professor masullo said the other day , when a teenager grabbed a woman s purse in broad daylight and ran into the spanish quarter , none of the 20 or so men he passed did anything to stop him the gangs' illegal income is drawn from vast cigarette and narcotics smuggling , up to 7 , 000 illicit parking lots , protection money , unlawful lotteries and widespread loansharking the funds are then invested in legal fronts clothes shops and pizza parlors and drycleaning outlets that provide a front for drugpeddling all that made for an idiosyncratic city run by organized crime and political barons in cahoots with them indeed , mr lamberti said , in the 19th century it was the tradition for newly appointed police chiefs and newly victorious camorra bosses to exchange gifts denoting their mutual respect what turned naples into a real mess was the booming corruption of the 1980 s few things work here because so much money to improve city services was diverted to private pockets and political parties on just about every major project , from relief funds after the 1980 earthquake to the building of stadiums for the 1990 world cup soccer tournament , most of the money from government coffers filtered into private pockets under such circumstances , it might almost seem worth asking what difference a new mayor will make all the candidates find it convenient to argue that it would be a success just to have basic administration make the traffic work , make the schools work , create administrative order , professor masullo said this is a huge lie because in our city , if administrative order does not exist , it is because of the structural defects of the city but the city s woes have implications far beyond its frontiers next july the leaders of seven major industrial nations are to gather here for a summit meeting , and the chaos is already causing apprehension among united states officials who have come here to scout hotels and presidential security diplomats are getting a bit edgy , too , over what could be a delicate encounter if miss mussolini becomes mayor , hers will be the honor , symbolically at least , of presenting the keys of the city to president clinton , 51 years after allied troops took the city photo alessandra mussolini , granddaughter of the italian dictator , campaigning for mayor in naples on tuesday a neofascist running on the italian social movement ticket , she has promised to rebuild the city \( gaetano lo porto daylight \) map of italy showing

washington , feb 10 presidents since andrew jackson have used whatever means they had to go over the heads of journalists and other intermediaries to speak directly to the people , especially when beleaguered bill clinton did so to good effect during his campaign last year , and tonight he demonstrated his skills again in an electronic town meeting that owed much to ross perot , larry king , phil donahue and the latest satellite technology he got more questions on subjects he would rather have avoided haiti , bosnia , homosexuals in the military and his difficulties in finding a successful candidate for attorney general and fewer on subjects he wanted to emphasize jobs and the economy but he seemed thoroughly in command themes of campaign the president had to defend himself against an accusation that he was reneging on his promise not to raise taxes on the middle class , and he had to field a demand from mr perot s campaign coordinator in michigan that he back a balancedbudget amendment but the exchanges sounded genuine , they showed him talking with voters , and they made for lively television perhaps most important of all , mr clinton found ample room to voice his concerns about sick people and people facing economic difficulties , echoing themes of 1992 that have been drowned out during the last few weeks like franklin d roosevelt s fireside chats during the new deal and lyndon b johnson s televised appeals during the vietnam war , president clinton s questionandanswer sessions are intended to build a constituency in the country at large for programs resisted by entrenched interests or a skeptical press corps in washington mr clinton mounted both direct and indirect attacks on the news media he said that kimba m wood , the federal district judge from new york who withdrew her name from consideration for attorney general , had been treated quite unfairly , but blamed that largely on erroneous press reports suggesting that she was about to be nominated those reports were based in large part on disclosures from his own administration he also deplored public attention to the homosexuality question , saying , i spent very little time on the issue myself it was he , nonetheless , who pledged in his campaign to do away with the military ban on gay men and lesbians and pressed forward on it in the first hours of his presidency the president s appearance in a television studio in a detroit suburb marked the start of a politically crucial effort to sell a package of tax increases and cuts in benefits to a nation notably resistant to sacrifice once again , as in 1992 , mr clinton beamed his message on unconventional channels ducking a question he said at the very end of the broadcast that he planned many such appearances , and he ducked a question about formal news conferences in the future so far he has held none journalists complain now , as they have before , that they are being circumvented but in the long run mr clinton is no more likely than his predecessors to completely avoid news conferences , with their more searching interrogation , and the professionals do not always ask the most revealing questions anyway perhaps the question that most damaged george bush last year , for example , was the one asked by a young woman in the audience during a debate in richmond about the impact of the recession on his friends and acquaintances the question put mr bush on the defensive by making him look unfeeling in his reaction to economic privation his response was the equivalent , in its way , of michael s dukakis s seemingly passionless response to a newsman s question in 1988 about how he would react if his wife were raped and murdered mr clinton , by exposing himself tonight to the questions of a carefully screened group of ordinary voters , apparently sought to turn the tables on those who have tormented him the most in recent days the administration made no secret of that jeff eller , a white house spokesman , said members of the audience had been told , the president would like to focus on jobs and the economy angry callers to radio talk programs and to capitol hill offices have had a major impact on the opening phase of mr clinton s presidency , as have many commentators in washington who have given him poor grades neither represents a true cross section of american opinion , as the white house argues with considerable force programs like tonight s give mr clinton a forum that is considerably more deferential , if no more balanced as the president arrived in detroit , he took a bit of poetic license glossing over all the other problems he has had to deal with in a jampacked 21 days , he told the crowd that welcomed him that he had been doing almost nothing but focusing on the economy on the public s mind the country will no doubt welcome a return to a discussion of the economy and jobs those were the issues that won the election for mr clinton , and opinion surveys suggest that they remain the issues most on people s minds but all the electronic magic in the world counts for nothing if the public feels it is being cheated or deceived johnson s pleas to voters to support your president went for naught when television showed voters a war they judged unjust richard m nixon s insistence that he was not a crook paled against the evidence that his administration was caught in a huge lie mr clinton will have to convince people on the merits that the sacrifices he calls for are equitably distributed it is a question of sharing the pain broadly among older citizens and young , between the rich and the middle class , between cities and suburbs and between various industrial sectors listen to what i say next week , decide whether it s fair , the president told a questioner tonight having lost some of the populist momentum of his campaign in the appointment of wealthy lawyers to major positions and in the largely inadvertent early emphasis on social issues that won him little mass sympathy , mr clinton is seeking to get it back cuts in white house staffing levels , increased taxes on the very rich and tonight s talk with the folks are intended to do that his supporters are hopeful that things are entering a new phase i admit that i see eerie parallels to the carter administration , said a prominent democrat who served in that administration there have been too many mistakes but the core of what bill clinton stood for in the campaign remains intact , and we will soon see whether he can deliver on it
washington , march 24 democratic senators held ranks today and defended president clinton s economic program against a fierce volley of political potshots from republicans by a vote of 52 to 47 , the democrats rejected the most serious republican threat to the clinton budget plan , an amendment that would have scrapped the president s proposal to raise taxes on the social security benefits of the most affluent retirees only four democrats voted against the president but as congress neared approval of the clinton plan , alan greenspan , the federal reserve chairman , called for even deeper cuts in the budget deficit , saying he feared that it would rise again late in the decade page d1 today s vote on the social security benefits was an important test because it showed that for the time being democrats were willing to stand fast behind the president , even on the most difficult issue politically the democrats also defeated a republican proposal for much deeper spending cuts than those mr clinton wants , more spending for the military and none of the clinton tax increases the vote , basically along party lines , was 57 to 42 the republican amendments came as the senate was considering the outline of mr clinton s budget their defeat showed beyond doubt that the basic budget plan would be approved intact on thursday the more crucial votes on exactly which taxes will be raised and which programs cut will not come until later in the year vote on spending plan after the budget vote on thursday , the senate will take up mr clinton s 16 billion spending bill , which is intended to stimulate the economy and create jobs over the next two years the discipline displayed by democrats today indicated that the stimulus package would probably pass , but senators said the president might have to accept some modest compromises to get it through the house of representatives approved slightly different versions of the budget plan and the stimulus bill last week the differences between the house and senate measures will be reconciled by conference committees to underscore the importance of the social security vote and how close the outcome had been expected to be , vice president al gore made a rare appearance to preside over the senate this morning in case his vote was needed to break a tie but the debate on the budget in general and the social security amendment in particular lacked the emotion that might have been expected on such sensitive topics senators from both parties tried harder to score politically than to illuminate the issues involved a higher tax on the social security benefits of some retirees is a central part of the clinton plan to cut the budget deficit the president would increase the portion of social security benefits that are subject to income taxes to 85 percent from 50 percent for couples with total incomes , including retirement benefits , of more than 32 , 000 and single retirees with incomes above 25 , 000 the social security payments of taxpayers with incomes below those thresholds are not now taxed and would not be under the clinton plan social security has been the heart and soul of the democratic party s philosophy for more than 50 years , and rare is the democratic politician who has not used the issue to gain leverage over republican opponents prime time debate so this time republicans tried to turn the tables with the debate on tuesday night televised live in prime time on cspan , the cable channel , they flailed at the democrats with one oratorical jab after another our nation s seniors did not create this budget deficit congress did , senator john mccain , republican of arizona , said in an almost empty senate chamber i will not be party to balancing the budget on the backs of our nation s seniors senator trent lott , republican of mississippi , said the president s proposal made a mockery of his campaign promise not to raise income taxes on anyone but the very wealthy and senator phil gramm , republican of texas , even accused mr clinton of wanting to tax the elderly on the potential income they could get if they rented their homes , an accusation that had no basis in fact but was meant to stick in the craw of the television viewers democrats for the most part stayed away from the debate , apparently confident they had the votes to beat back the republican onslaught but occasionally they entered the fray , saying that the deficit had to be reduced and that the best course was to follow the clinton prescription the higher social security tax would raise more than 30 billion over five years , one of the largest tax increases in the president s plan democratic counterattack our colleagues are now making an effort to derail president clinton s momentum , senator george j mitchell of maine , the democratic leader , said when the senate went back into session this morning do we want to give president clinton a chance , or do we want to torpedo president clinton s program before it gets under way \? the only democrats who voted with the republicans were howell heflin and richard c shelby of alabama , dennis deconcini of arizona and bob krueger of texas a fifth , daniel k inouye of hawaii , was absent but the democrats had some partisan gamesmanship up their sleeves also after the social security vote , senators frank r lautenberg of new jersey and jim exon of nebraska offered an amendment that they termed a compromise it expressed the sense of the senate that the finance committee should try to find a way not to raise the taxes of single retirees with incomes below 32 , 000 and couples with incomes below 40 , 000 the amendment was approved , 67 to 32 , with every democrat in favor except charles s robb of virginia , who voted no , and mr inouye , who was absent sense of the senate measures have no binding effect and are often ignored after the vote is taken , but senator lautenberg immediately issued a news release taking credit for liberating more than one million retirees from the effect of the proposed new tax photo our colleagues are now making an effort to derail president clinton s momentum , said george j mitchell , senate majority leader \( andrea mohin \) \( pg a20 \)
for the knicks , especially charles smith , it was utter frustration and despair for the chicago bulls , it was ecstacy , and a major step toward advancing to a third consecutive championship series ending the knicks' 27game winning streak at madison square garden , chicago took a 32 lead in the fourofsevengame eastern conference championship series with a dramatic 9794 victory last night the bulls can end the series , and the knicks' season , by winning game 6 on friday night in chicago the game was decided on the knicks' final possession , when charles smith missed four consecutive chances from pointblank range the sequence began when patrick ewing \( 33 points \) fell to the ground as he drove to the basket , but made a pass while falling , to smith , who was 3feet from the basket in the lane smith s first attempt was blocked by horace grant \( 11 points , 10 rebounds \) with about 10 seconds to play smith rebounded , then had the ball striped by michael jordan \( 29 points , 14 assists , 10 rebounds \) as smith went up smith recovered again , but his next two shots were blocked by scottie pippen \( 28 points , 11 rebounds \) grant finally grabbed the rebound , then quickly passed to jordan with about five seconds left , who spotted b j armstrong behind new york s defense armstrong made a layup at the buzzer , and the jubilant bulls started to celebrate credit the defense was smith fouled during the final sequence \? i'm tired of talking about fouls and officiating , smith said you watch the film and you be the judge i would n't have done anything differently whether there was a foul or not , none was called , which is not unusual in gameending situations and the bulls played terrific defense in a gamesaving sequence i just thought we played good defense , said pippen , the bulls' allstar forward who had a terrific allround game i thought smith might have traveled after he took that first shot we realized that for us to win the series , we had to come in here and win a game we did n't want to play a game 7 , so this was the best time for us to get a win and it was a victory the bulls deserved the knicks hurt themselves badly with horrendous foul shooting , making just 20 of 35 and the bulls badly outrebounded the knicks \( 4837 \) , a department that new york prides itself in , particularly at home obviously , it s very disppointing for us not to be able to hold the homecourt advantage , said pat riley , the knicks' coach maybe this is the most defining moment of this team s life we just did n't get it done , although we had great opportunities we just have to deal with that , go to chicago , and win that s the only alternative we could 've played much better than we did it hurts when you need something so much this is a very painful loss the free throws are free a few more of them would have made a big difference , but we seemed a bit tight somebody coined a phrase no rebounds , no rings we showed a lot of resolve , but we just did not play well after smith made just 1 of 2 free throws to make the score 9594 with 528 seconds left , the knicks' chance to win was set up when ewing blocked a jumper by stacey king , forcing a 24second violation on chicago with 288 seconds left that set up the final sequence , but smith could n't convert , and now the knicks cannot afford another loss the biggest shot with the score tied at 92 , patrick ewing made just 1 of 2 free throws to give new york a 9392 lead then jordan drove into the lane , sucked in new york s defense , then passed to b j armstrong who was wide open in the left corner armstrong calmly made the 3point 24footer , giving chicago a 9593 lead with 1 minute 17 seconds left i thought that was the biggest shot of the game , riley said after a timeout , doc rivers missed badly on a 3pointer and ewing lost the rebound out of bounds but after armstrong missed another jumper from the corner , pippen fouled smith going after the rebound with 528 seconds to play smith missed the first foul shot , and a timeout was called then smith made the second free throw , cutting the knicks' deficit to 9594 and setting up the final sequence chicago controlled play most of the second half , forcing the knicks to play catchup the knicks were clearly in trouble when riley called a timeout with 8 06 left , and the bulls leading 8780 jordan was on a tear , having scored 14 of chicago s previous 16 points , and the bulls knew they were in position to win jordan shot just 11 for 24 from the field , but his tripledouble was another mark of his ability to do whatever it takes jordan s adjustment though jordan continues his policy of not talking to the media , pippen did it for him michael is a professional , pippen said he realizes when things are not going his way , he s got to draw the defense and get the ball to one of us that s why we were able to stay in the game the third quarter ended with the bulls leading , 8077 it was a bad sign for the knicks that chicago already had 80 points , and that scottie pippen already had 27 points all things considered , the knicks were fortunate to be as close as they were a frightening scene for the bulls occurred with 4 01 left in the third quarter , when michael jordan fell to the floor , grimacing in pain , after taking a charge from doc rivers jordan was accidently kicked in the stomach by rivers on the drive not only did the blow knock the wind out of jordan , half of the windy city was probably holding its breath waiting for jordan to get up after about a minute , he did and he made his next three jumpers to prove he was alright jordan was held to a mortal first half 10 points on 3for12 shooting the knicks' strategy against jordan changed slightly , as they alternated between doubleteaming jordan and playing him straight up , trying to throw off his rhythm yet while jordan was contained , pippen took up the slack pippen was the best player on the court during the first half , leading all scorers with 17 points on 8for11 shooting any talk about pippen being a soft player seemed absurb after this 24minute display pippen took the ball strong to the basket , including a vicious slam dunk late in the first half , the second best slam of the series next to starks s in game 2 it s not over , a defiant ewing said rebounds charles oakley \( 6 points , 4 rebounds \) said he injured his left hand in game 4 and says that it is still bothering him he will have xrays taken of his hand today , and his status for game 6 is not clear photos charles smith going up for one of four chances at the end of the game last night scottie pippen blocked the shot doc rivers hanging his head after the knicks lost to the bulls last night \( barton silverman the new

deerfield , ill , oct 8 jerry krause , the general manager of the michael jordanless chicago bulls , kept saying that when he awoke thursday morning , the sun was shining and the newspapers contained none of his friends' or relatives' obituaries he did n't say anything about today this was the day the reality of jordan s retirement announcement on wednesday finally hit home the bulls opened their training camp this morning , and while basketball s elvis happened to be in the building , he was not in uniform everyone pretty much agreed with coach phil jackson , who said i know the potential for him coming back next season is out there , but that s a whole year away i'm sure he wo n't be playing this season , and that s what we 're playing for with the exception of a startling moment when jordan , dressed in white tshirt and blue warmup pants , appeared from the bulls' locker room and bounded up the stairs to the second level of the team s practice center for what jackson said was a scheduled interview , today was a time to begin examination of the bulls as they now appear the reserve center , will perdue , compared the team to a train about to be driven into a dark tunnel the question is how long a tunnel the bulls are about to enter , and , barring a return by the sport s greatest player , if there will ever be light these ball players have been known as the jordanaires the last three or four years , said jackson this is a great opportunity for our team , for everyone , to step into areas in which we can suddenly establish ourselves what jackson was saying is that there is n't one member of the bulls , including himself and krause , whose reputations have not been tied to jordan s lifeline in a way , the worst thing that can happen to them is that they simply confirm what most people already believe they are nothing without jordan people are going to lose a lot of respect for us , said scottie pippen we understand that it s just up to us to go out and win it back jackson said pippen , like it or not , will carry a greater burden he broke this news to pippen by slapping him on the back and saying , that s where the saddle s going to lay pippen , already an allstar who should have buried all the soft talk in the playoffs last spring against the knicks , shrugged when he asked if he minded carrying around the extra equipment i'm not going to feel any extra pressure , he said pippen and horace grant are already established forces at their positions grant has always wanted more shots and has regularly threatened to go elsewhere to get them today he said he would become an unrestricted free agent next summer if a contract extension is not negotiated by the end of training camp jackson figures any serious compensation for the loss of jordan will have to come from b j armstrong , the improving guard whose creativity was certainly stymied by jordan , and toni kukoc , the 6foot11inch croatian star who participated in his first official bulls workout today help from anoutside source is not likely , he said , though krause said he has some interest in byron scott , the freeagent shooting guard no amount of positive thought will make up for jordan s 32 points , his ability to score and defend and lead jackson said he expects the bulls will feel it most on the road that s where we 'll be missing most of our resolve , the cocky stance michael brought that s why jackson knew it was no longer to his benefit to take the bait when the inevitable question of the knicks and his rival , pat riley , was raised i do n't want to give them any more ammunition , or hopes , he said pat s going to say the right things he s going to get out there and drive his team we think we can still compete at this level one of the encouraging things that michael said to us was , 'i would n't have retired if i did n't think you guys were n't ready to step up to the position where you can defend the championship' photo b j armstrong , left , and horace grant working out yesterday during the first day of bulls practice \( associated press \) \( pg 35 \)

the balkan express fragments from the other side of war by slavenka drakulic 146 pp new york w w norton company 1995 no mystery seems more urgent or more difficult to fathom than the riddle of how a society as seemingly civilized as our own one in which children play video games and babies loll in hightech strollers while their parents browse in bookstores and drink cappuccino in cafes could erupt in an orgy of savagery , murder and rape certainly that is a question we ask ourselves about the balkans , even though the photographers only got to sarajevo in time to catch the fires , the rubble , the corpses , the scorched holes in buildings and so have mercifully spared us images of the beautiful city it used to be slavenka drakulic , a croatian journalist whose previous books include how we survived communism and even laughed , knows precisely how lovely and how complex the former yugoslavia was , and how deeply the fighting has scarred the newly independent republics the essays that make up her latest collection , the balkan express , read like notes on learning how to survive in a land at war and how to absorb the successive shocks of violent change and disruption written between april 1991 and may 1992 and assembled in roughly chronological order , these mostly short pieces form a loose narrative the book begins with ms drakulic in cambridge , mass , scribbling a map on a napkin to show her american friends the fault lines along which her homeland is starting to break apart ms drakulic flies home to zagreb and the spreading war in croatia when the airraid sirens sound in her city , she heads north to slovenia even before the allclear signals , she returns to zagreb to report on the way rabid nationalism is diminishing her neighbors' lives strangers in a railway compartment ca n't remark on the passing scenery for fear their language may betray them as enemies a croatian actress s career is ruined when she performs in the serbian capital , belgrade a liberal journalist , critical of antiserbian hysteria , has her apartment usurped by a house sitter who slyly exploits the new climate of officially sanctioned hatred at the front line , ms drakulic interviews a reluctant killer , and the divisiveness engendered by war edges uncomfortably close to home after a friend arrives in zagreb , fleeing sarajevo , and ms drakulic must confront her own prejudices toward refugees the abstractions of governmental change become instantly concrete when , in a troubling essay , we see ms drakulic s mother worrying about whether to remove the red star from her husband s tombstone the symbol that the man so loved may incite vandals to wreck the grave one gripping chapter records ms drakulic s chillingly matteroffact conversation with a young man whose parents have been killed and who has become a killer and the story of the woman who stole an apartment portrays , with remarkable compression , the complicated ironies of class and privilege under the old and new regimes one is thankful for ms drakulic s intelligent and brave refusal to descend to polemic , or to xenophobic finger pointing wisely , she avoids blaming the brutal ethnic other for the war and looks for the true culprit forces in the communal and political history of the region but finally , she writes , there must and does come the question why , which is the hardest to answer because there are hundreds of answers to it , none of them good enough no graphics , drawings or maps can be of any genuine help , because the burden of the past symbols , fears , national heroes , mythologies , folk songs , gestures and looks , everything that makes up the irrational and , buried deep in our subconscious , threatens to erupt any day now simply cannot be explained no one can fault ms drakulic for failing to explain the inexplicable or for voicing the contradictions that one hears so frequently everyone saw the war coming , but no one believed it would come ethnic antagonisms had simmered for centuries , yet nationality was n't an issue such inconsistencies are , she says , precisely what i wanted to write about even so , her thoughts on the war can seem muddled and bewildering at one point she appears to be suggesting that the current blood bath has its roots in foreign shopping trips recently an american friend asked me how it happened that the most liberal and bestoff communist country was the one that now had the war the answer is so simple that i'm almost ashamed of it we traded our freedom for italian shoes there is a certain recklessness about this , as there is throughout these essays personal and heartfelt , the balkan express comes on like a freight train fans will admire its headlong intensity , its undiluted , passionate rawness others may find themselves wishing for more considered , serious thought , especially given the gravity of the book s subject thus when a soldier confides to her in what sounds like a line from an isaac babel story , we feel that ms drakulic s response is a bit peremptory and inattentive the man who checked my papers and signed a permit said to me perhaps because i'm a woman 'i only wish i had a plate of hot soup , ' as if this sentence would best explain to me how he felt he might as well have said , i only wish i could get some sleep , or watch a soccer game on tv or have some peace and quiet each of his wishes would have been equally pointless ms drakulic s strategy is to filter the world through the lens of the self on occasion this fogs her view of the life around her her emotional engagement is the collection s strength , but patches of overwrought and sentimental writing make one long for the exquisitely conscious and modest restraint with which writers like nadezhda mandelstam and eugenia ginzburg described their painful experiences during equally tumultuous times nowhere is this more problematic than in the chapter entitled on becoming a refugee and its passages in which ms drakulic flees croatia to stay at a friend s empty apartment in slovenia , then returns to her \( intact \) zagreb home with its laura ashley wallpaper without denying the reality of her suffering , one looks in vain for acknowledgment that her exile is brief , her travails minor compared with those of the citizens of vukovar and bosnia later , in a letter to her daughter , who has left croatia , ms drakulic does make and at once retracts just such a disclaimer what happened to the two of us could n't be compared to what other people have had to go through , loss of lives , of homes , of everything but in suffering there are no comparisons , i cannot suffer less because someone else is suffering more while ms drakulic chooses not to distinguish between degrees of suffering , some readers may feel that they can and may find that , unmediated by humility and a sharper sense of perspective , ms drakulic s report on her exile is faintly tinged with selfdramatization still , one is glad that the balkan express was written , and hopeful that ms drakulic s essays will inform and touch her readers ideally , her impassioned eyewitness account of the balkan conflict may make the war more real to those who have somehow managed to distance themselves from the appalling television news footage of rape victims , cadaverous prisoners and the ruins of oncegracious cities one thinks of the historic english law that made it a punishable offense to witness a murder or discover a corpse and not raise a hue and cry judged by that standard , slavenka drakulic is one of the very few innocents
from beginning to end , the investigation into the death of yankel rosenbaum during the racial disturbances in crown heights was a protracted exercise in how not to solve and prosecute a crime , according to the state report released yesterday the report concluded that the police investigation into the stabbing of mr rosenbaum , a hasidic scholar , and the district attorney s subsequent prosecution of lemrick nelson , a 17yearold black youth acquitted of the crime , were so thoroughly riddled with flawed procedures and bungling of the most fundamental nature that it is unlikely that anyone will be convicted of the murder in the chronology spelled out by the report , the mistakes started at once shortly after mr rosenbaum was engulfed by a mob of violent black youths on the evening of aug 19 , 1991 , two police officers spied the assault at least four men were caught and shown to the dying mr rosenbaum two were let go without their names or descriptions being recorded one was arrested and later released the fourth was mr nelson , the only person tried for the crime names not taken innumerable police officers , medical technicians and civilians converged on that chilling crown heights scene yet the police got none of their names two transit officers took mr nelson to the 71st precinct nobody asked who the transit officers were or found out what they knew in the three hours before mr rosenbaum died , no officer asked him for details of what happened , even though he was lucid hours passed before mr nelson was questioned not until mr rosenbaum died did two detectives interview mr nelson both said he confessed but they took no notes or signed statements handling of evidence eight hours after the attack , an assistant district attorney arrived to interview mr nelson , who refused to make a statement the arresting officers recovered a bloodstained knife and three one dollar bills with blood on them from mr nelson s pocket but the report said the evidence was treated sloppily the knife was passed among three police officers before one of them stuck it in his pocket later , the officer put the dollar bills in the same pocket , commingling the evidence the police never noticed whether blood on mr nelson s jeans was there when he was caught , allowing the possibility that he got the stains when he was shown to mr rosenbaum to locate witnesses , the police began a canvas of the immediate neighborhood on aug 27 , eight days after the attack they covered homes one block east and west of the crime scene , though most people were not home the report said the canvas should have begun sooner and embraced a wider area only 6 officers interviewed out of numerous police officers involved in the events surrounding the crime , the report said the detectives on the case interviewed only six when prosecutors in the office of district attorney charles j hynes brought the case to trial last september , they offered evidence that appeared convincing yet as witnesses testified , inconsistencies tripped over one another at virtually every turn several officers testified that they announced over the police radio that they were pursuing a black male wearing a red shirt , as mr nelson was but a transit officer , robert lewis , said he never heard that , and when the jurors listened to a tape of the radio transmissions they heard nothing of the man in the red shirt the jurors gave great weight to the discrepancy , the report said , leading them to think the police were lying two key witnesses the report said that the jurors found many contradictions between two key police witnesses mark hoppe , the police officer who arrested mr nelson , and mr lewis and chose to believe mr lewis for two reasons because mr hoppe had applied for a commendation for his work on the case , the jurors felt that he was embellishing his role although mr lewis was present at mr nelson s arrest , he was not identified until jury selection , more than a year after the crime , and jurors wondered if the prosecution did not want him to testify a pivotal moment came when the presiding judge , supreme court justice edward m rappaport , expressed shock when police officers provided divergent accounts of how the bloodstained knife was handled the jurors took that reaction as evidence that the case was flawed the report pointedly faulted judge rappaport for conveying through his statements and demeanor that the credibility of several prosecution witnesses was suspect explanation of law faulted mr nelson might have been convicted , the report said , had the law been better explained to the jurors mr nelson was charged with acting in concert with others , meaning that the jury could convict mr nelson if they believed he took part in the attack even if they were unsure if he actually stabbed mr rosenbaum but the report said the judge did a poor job of explaining this concept most jurors , the report said , believed mr nelson probably participated in the attack but did not understand the actinginconcert principle the report said the acquittal was probably not affected by a preconceived mistrust of police officers after weighing all the evidence , some of which the jury never heard , the report concluded that mr nelson probably did participate in the attack on mr rosenbaum on oct 29 , 1992 , after four days of deliberations , the jury found mr nelson not guilty on all counts photo a group of hasidic jews watching the news conference announcing the report on the crown heights riots from the offices of the national committee for the furtherance of jewish education in brooklyn \( jim estrin the new york times \) chart highlights the crown heights report the mayor did not restrain the police department but he did not act decisively to restore peace even though information was available that the disturbance was not under control , the mayor asserts that he was unaware of the seriousness of the situation throughout , there was a lack of coordination in city hall police commissioner lee p brown and the top police commanders failed to fulfill their responsibility to preserve the peace deployment of officers came too late and police could not maintain control of demonstrations that often ended in rampaging and confrontations between protesters and hasidim basic police work was mishandled in the initial investigation , greatly diminishing the chances that those responsible for the death of yankel rosenbaum would be caught the jury acted reasonably in acquitting lemrick nelson , considering the problems with the evidence provided by the prosecution the jurors did not have an inherent distrust of police officers but were confused by the forensic testimony and some of the basic premises of the prosecution s argument the way judge edward rappaport conducted the trial appears to have influenced the verdict

san francisco when the photographer rick smolan decided to create a multimedia version of from alice to ocean , his coffeetable book about a young woman s walk across the australian desert with four camels , he had rich material to work with his own photographs and narration by the woman , robyn davidson , reading from her own best seller on the trip , tracks to these mr smolan added short video clips on australian cultures , animal life and his photographic techniques the challenge was to put it all together in an interactive form that could be viewed on a personal computer with a cdrom player and allow the user either to sit back and let the story unfold or use a mouse to select annotated side trips , like a photo essay on life in an aboriginal village mr smolan said the project may not have been possible without a software tool called director , produced by macromedia , a san francisco company whose multimedia development software has become a de facto standard director enables multimedia producers to link text , video , graphics , animation and sound , without writing the many lines of software code that such an undertaking might otherwise require when we put the interactive cd together it gave us an incredible feeling of freedom , because we were able to give people many different paths through the story , said mr smolan , whose project team included a techie adept at using director since its cdrom release last year by the publishers addisonwesley and against all odds productions , which are giving the software away with the 50 coffeetable book , the cdrom version of from alice to ocean , has come to be considered the state of the art in multimedia apple computer inc , which subsidized mr smolan s project , is also giving away a copy of alice to help sell its 499 cdrom players machines that run compact disks containing data , graphics , text or music in a field where 3 , 000 copies constitute a best seller , wouldbe creators of multimedia titles soon run into two harsh realities first , to create anything of professional quality can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars mr smolan and apple will not discuss their costs , but people in the industry guess that as much as 1 million might have gone into alice second , multimedia creators not only must be proficient writers , musicians and film directors , they must also learn how to write software code that instructs a photo at precisely what point in a musical score to appear on screen or tells the video clip when to give way to the text or they can use tools like macromedia s director to perform much of this software drudgery for them macromedia , created over the course of 1991 and 1992 through the merger of three companies that were founded in the 80 s , is the largest supplier of multimedia development tools and though still hardly a household word , macromedia makes the tools that have been used in the creation of virtually every bestselling multimedia title besides from alice to ocean , some of the popular cdrom titles include the journeyman project , by presto studios , an interactive science fiction game novel , which combines animation , video with real actors and photorealistic threedimensional worlds macromedia software has also been used to create employee training programs by businesses like mcgraw hill and prentice hall , and presentations by prominent companies including american airlines , at t and kellogg s and while hollywood still relies on hardware and software from silicon graphics inc for much of its special effects , macromedia tools have been used in creating sequences in jurassic park , the firm and other films success has been slow in coming , and none of macromedia s predecessor companies macromind , authorware and paracomp ever made any money but macromedia has begun to take off , thanks to the rapid growth of the market for cdrom players and for cdrom multimedia titles sales of personal computers equipped with a cdrom drive , 2 million in 1992 , are expected to reach 15 million a year by 1995 , according to dataquest , a silicon valley market research firm executives for privately held macromedia , which does not disclose its financial data , say the company has been profitable the last four quarters and analysts estimate that macromedia had 1992 revenues of about 30 million or more than onethird of the estimated 80 million market for multimedia software tools the company thus seems well positioned to benefit from the multimedia mania sweeping the computing , communications and entertainment industries in 1994 , we 're going to see the company take off , said charles finnie , an analyst with volpe , welty company , a venture capital and investment banking firm , which has invested in

newark , july 26 an elaborate vision of hightech offices , homes , parks and shops was put forth today for a desolate 50acre tract in this city s central ward , with federal , state and community leaders praising the plans as a formula for hope and economic growth during the next 20 years although the proposal , called university heights science park , is little more than a concept at this point , officials at the announcement ceremony in city hall spoke encouragingly of the collaboration of educational institutions and civic leaders that would lead , they said , to 3 , 000 permanent jobs and 4 million in propertytax revenue on land that now generates next to nothing educated guesses they also acknowledged that the detailed architectural renderings arrayed behind gov jim florio , senator frank r lautenberg and representative donald m payne were merely educated guesses as to what might eventually be built they insisted , however , that their goal of a 250 million development amid the scars left by the 1967 riots was realistic to underscore faith in the proposal , everett shaw , deputy mayor for economic development , pointed to two highly speculative ideas that have recently moved closer to completion and that , with the science park , are considered complementary to the effort to revitalize newark the first is the 60 million performing arts center , for which site preparation is under way the second is the proposed 850 million rail line that would link newark and elizabeth to newark international airport mr shaw , who also serves as president of renaissance newark , a businesssupported group to encourage commerce and development , acted as host and cheerleader for the event , saying the proposal was on the cutting edge of how planning will occur in urban centers there s no room for critics , he said there s only room for participants to join university heights is a term coined about 15 years ago when four of newark s major educational institutions rutgers university , essex county college , new jersey institute of technology and the university of medicine and dentistry of new jersey came together to act as a catalyst for new housing and other civic needs under the plan , students , faculty members and researchers from each institution will work to develop new biomedical products that would attract manufacturing to the park , which has antecedents in philadelphia and other cities the state has committed 85 million in seed money , and the federal department of housing and urban development provided 15 million to buy remaining land and buildings about half the land is governmentowned and off the tax rolls most is vacant except for about 110 units of housing and a hodgepodge of vacant or littleused buildings olympicstyle ceremony the planners , whose committee includes the presidents of the four institutions , envision one million square feet of commercial space , 150 to 200 homes for low to moderateincome families , park and recreation space and day care after the startup , which includes renovation of an existing building next to new jersey institute of technology for laboratory and office use , officials hope that venture capitalists will underwrite most of the development projections by the institute of technology forecast 7 , 600 construction jobs and 3 , 000 permanent jobs , with 450 for newark residents , if the project is completed the plan also calls for a science high school to attract students from newark and surrounding communities , as well as job training the 90minute announcement ceremony in the city hall rotunda concluded with a symbolic torch lighting that featured six flashlights camouflaged as olympicstyle lamps as newark s business administrator , glenn grant , sounded themes of community , hope and cooperation , governor florio and other officials solemnly placed each torch into a frame that resembled an oversize testtube holder conspicuous by his absence was newark s mayor , sharpe james , whose reputation as a civic booster is unrivaled here a sheaf of news releases included a congratulatory letter from the mayor dated july 23 but made no mention of missing the ceremony some officials cited the mayor s achievements , but none noted his absence later , a city spokeswoman , andrea martin , said mr james was on a longplanned annual trip with the sharpe james civic association , a group of the mayor s political supporters she said he would return to the city next week map of newark showing location of univ heights science park
rome , dec 30 even as it finally recognized israel , the vatican sought today to defend its position in the arab world and to register its demand for international guarantees of jerusalem s spiritual status as a holy place for christians , jews and muslims alike the spokesman for the vatican , joaquin navarrovalls , set out its position at a news conference here several hours before the signing of a recognition agreement supposed in part to ease 2 , 000 years of often painful history as if to balance the effect of the development on arab countries with christian minorities , mr navarrovalls said a similar agreement to recognize jordan was in the works i hope i can announce it soon , he said moreover , mr navarrovalls said msgr claudio celli , the papal envoy who traveled to jerusalem to sign the agreement today on behalf of the vatican , would meet on friday with palestinians nominated by the palestine liberation organization to begin an institutionalized dialogue embassy to be in jaffa the vatican said its embassy in israel would not be in jerusalem or tel aviv but in jaffa , which has a large israeli arab population tel aviv and jaffa run together as a single conurbation under the municipality of tel aviv most foreign missions , including the american embassy , are in tel aviv so as to avoid diplomatic acknowledgment of the annexation of east jerusalem by israel in 1980 since some other missions are in jaffa and since it and tel aviv are so closely entwined , israeli officials said they did not see the location of the new vatican embassy as unusual but mr navarrovalls said the jaffa location in a churchowned residence for the franciscan order had been chosen for economic and technical reasons this is nothing with a political reason , he said previously , the pope s representative in jerusalem for an area known in vatican parlance as jerusalem and palestine has held the rank of apostolic delegate , meaning that he is accredited to the local roman catholic church , not to any government guarantees are sought vatican diplomats accredited to governments recognized by the holy see are known as nuncios vatican officials said the new nuncio in israel would also have the title of apostolic delegate to jerusalem and jordan , meaning he would maintain access to the existing official church residence in jerusalem mr navarrovalls went out of his way to stress the vatican s continued commitment to seeking some form of international guarantees for the city s spiritual status the holy see feels the duty and the right to continue to claim , as it has always done , several guarantees in the international sphere , he said it asks that whoever exercises sovereignty , alone or with others , must adhere to an internationally guaranteed special statute regarding the safekeeping of the highest religious and cultural values found in that area the vatican does not have a formula , he said it just wants to state this principle it is not attacking sovereignty the vatican s concerns reflect a sense among some vatican officials that the fundamental agreement signed in jerusalem today falls short of addressing all the vatican s interests in the middle east and has compromised on the jerusalem issue until a few years ago , the vatican insisted that jerusalem be run as a separate , internationally supervised entity while that demand has been abandoned , today s agreement seemed remarkable for the absence of any israeli concession toward the vatican s desire that the status of the city s holy sites be internationally guaranteed , even if only symbolically israel captured east jerusalem from jordan in the 1967 middle east war and declared the city its united and eternal capital in 1980 the vatican s decision to highlight its concerns about the city today seemed also to reflect its desire to keep step with palestinians negotiating peace with israel mr navarrovalls seemed to support palestinian demands for national sovereignty indirectly , saying he hoped the peace negotiations would display respect for the rights that everyone has to live with dignity , peace and security within one s own homeland the vatican has always acknowledged israel s right to exist within secure boundaries but , mr navarrovalls said , it shied from full recognition until the arabs and israelis were at the same table talking peace for many years , the attitude of the vatican toward israel has been conditioned by the weight of the centuries , and by its worries that ties with israel would jeopardize christian minorities dotted across the arab world from syria and jordan to iraq and egypt deal 'almost concluded' mr navarrovalls said the vatican summoned arab ambassadors last july to discuss its negotiations with israel and none had opposed the idea but it seemed no coincidence that , on the day it recognized israel , the vatican should publicize its secret negotiations with jordan on a similar recognition agreement jordan has a small christian minority that includes some 50 , 000 roman catholics jordanian law accords the country s christians special voting rights so that they are represented in parliament but the vatican has always expressed concern that christians under more hardline governments in the middle east , like those in iraq , could be penalized as a result of the vatican s recognition of israel shortly after the agreement was signed today , the militant hamas islamic resistance movement issued a statement in amman , the jordanian capital , condemning the move as part of the shameful fallout of the peace agreement between israel and the palestine liberation organization
springfield , nj , june 20 paul azinger and craig parry birdied the last hole of the united states open today and finished tied for third , five strokes behind the winner , lee janzen , but they were both a bit crestfallen i'm disappointed because the last two days i made some great putts that just hit the edge and did n't go in , azinger said in front of his locker , after declining a request from the united states golf association for an interview in the press tent i'm not upset , azinger said i did n't really turn down the interview i just told them they should n't be talking to me because i was nowhere near the lead azinger shot 69 each of the last two days to tie for third his best finish in 10 opens the 33yearold azinger has nine pga tour victories to his credit , including this year s memorial in ohio , but a major is still missing from his resume parry , a 27yearold australian , has four victories on the european tour and none on the pga tour he received a special exemption to play here at baltusrol and said he considered it an honor that the usga would give a special excemption to a foreign player i think it s every player s top priority to win a major championship , said parry it s what we 're all judged on everything that goes with it in monetary terms , that s nothing compared to winning a major it seems that the only time i concentrate in a golf tournament nowadays is in a major it s the only time i perform better i lost this one , but there are two more left he was referring to the british open at royal st georges in england next month and the pga championship at inverness in toledo , ohio , in august parry came close on his fourth united states open attempt with rounds of 66746968 today he had five birdies , a bogey and a doublebogey , on the 428yard 11th azinger had a 69 on four birdies and three bogeys he had several opportunities for more birdies , but the putts did n't drop for him looking back at the last two rounds , he said , i missed several putts from five to seven feet , but i also made some mistakes and hit a few bad shots azinger admitted that failing to win a major has bothered him , but he was quick to point out how happy he was about the position he was in i do n't know how long i 'll be playing at this level , azinger said i 've been playing well since last october it s hard to complain my kids are healthy , i'm healthy , my wife is healthy and my parents are healthy i'm not wrapped up into golf azinger is one of the most competitive golfers on the tour , but he was able to hide his frustration when he missed his birdie on the 216yard16th , the hole that lee janzen chipped in to bring back memories of tom watson s chip on the 17th at pebble beach in 1982 watson , who shot 69 and finished at 278 in a tie with scott hoch , said he was encouraged by his good play this week , but he did n't plan to be a playing captain on the ryder cup team if i would play my way onto the team , i will play , watson said since i do n't have very many points , after this week i will have 150 points and i need about 600 if i win the british open or the pga , then i will play holeinone for lyle sandy lyle had one holeinone today and nearly a second otherwise , lyle , a scot who won the 1988 masters and the 1985 british open , had an ordinary round a score of 72 for a total of sixoverpar 286 it lightened the whole day for me , lyle said of his shot and then i missed an 8foot putt for birdie on the next hole the holdinone came on the 12th at a distance lyle calculated at 206 yards his club of choice was a 5iron his partner , bill andrade of bristol , ri , said it s a blind hole , so we could n't see all the green but the crowd sure made anoise and then on the 16th he hit the pin on that hole the ball bounced away and lyle had to settle for two putts and a par 3 it was a good , solid 6iron , lyle said the pin hit did n't do me any favors
belgrade , yugoslavia , april 27 defying growing international pressure aimed at forcing an end to the fighting in bosnia and herzegovina , serbian fighters mounted a new ground and artillery attack today on the muslimheld area around the town of bihac serbs opened the attack as new united nations sanctions on the former yugoslavia took effect under the sanctions , yugoslav assets abroad are to be confiscated , and the transporting of most foreignmade goods through the two remaining yugoslav republics , serbia and montenegro , is forbidden anticipating the imposition of sanctions , yugoslav leaders appealed to the serbian nationalists in bosnia over the weekend to accept an international mediation team s peace plan their appeal was rejected , and today s attack on bihac suggested that at least some bosnian serbs have no intention of winding down their war a senior united nations official , cedric thornberry , said about 1 , 000 serbs backed by 10 tanks and an undetermined number of artillery pieces attacked bihac before dawn today the bihac area is the last remaining muslim stronghold in northwestern bosnia fighting in four areas according to united nations officials , artillery attacks on bihac began monday night , and an infantry assault began several hours later they said fighting was raging in at least four areas around bihac radovan karadzic , leader of the bosnian serbs , denied that his forces were seeking to capture the town we are not going to take over bihac we are not going to enter bihac , dr karadzic told reporters in belgrade muslims are provoking us on almost all front lines in a statement distributed by the yugoslav news agency tanyug , the bosnian serbs' military command attributed the attack to an unorganized group of men acting without orders it said the men had attacked bihac to avenge deaths and destruction caused by muslim and croatian forces in their villages last year mr thornberry acknowledged that the attacking force was certainly not the size expected to take bihac we cannot rule out the possibility that it was a local crazy initiative , he said many refugees in area nearly 300 , 000 people , many of them refugees from nearby villages already seized by serbian forces , are living in the bihac area in recent months , they have survived principally on food and medicine transported by united nations forces the humanitarian consequences of sustained fighting in the area could be very serious , the united nations protection force said in a statement the united nations military commander for the balkans , lieut gen larseric wahlgren of sweden , ordered the 1 , 000 french troops providing relief assistance in the bihac area to use force if required to prevent human rights violations , the abuse of civilians or taking them as hostages new sanction provisions under the tightened sanctions that took effect today , trucks will no longer be able to pass through yugoslavia on their way to other destinations weaker sanctions that have been in effect for the last year allowed such transshipment , and many truckers and danube river captains who claimed to be only passing through yugoslavia actually unloaded cargo here the tighter sanctions also include imposition of a 12mile maritime exclusion zone off the yugoslav coast , new controls on vessels using the danube and bans on the use of yugoslav buses or railway cars for international traffic the government in belgrade should be in no doubt that the sanctions regime will be imposed with ever greater effectiveness , a senior british official , douglas hogg , said in london today we are prepared to sustain this effort for as long as it takes the new french foreign minister , alain juppe , warned that countries that do not cooperate in imposing the new sanctions would be punished he did not name any country , but news reports from paris said france believed that greece , macedonia , bulgaria and romania had been lax in their enforcement up to now we have to let the states in the region know that we 've had enough of them not playing the game , mr juppe said in a televised interview we must explain to them that their relations with european countries , which are often very intensive financially and commercially , will come into question if they do n't observe the embargo complaints of losses yugoslavia s principal trading partners pledged in statements today that they would enforce the new sanctions , but complained that they had lost large amounts of money as a result of the limited sanctions imposed last year hungary said it had lost 500 million in trade , and romanian officials put their country s losses in the billions of dollars bulgaria did not set a figure for its losses , but said it would seek compensation from the international community greece , which put its losses at 26 billion , and the ukraine also said they would seek compensation senior nato officials met in brussels today to discuss the possibility of bombing raids against serbian targets several of them expressed reservations about the idea field marshal sir richard vincent , chairman of nato s military committee , said he was healthily skeptical the combination of tightened sanctions and the threat of military action appears to have had an effect in belgrade , if not in bosnia letter from yugoslavs when the selfproclaimed parliament of bosnian serbs met last weekend in the bosnian town of bijeljina , they were presented with a letter signed by the president of the serbian republic , slobodan milosevic president momir bulatovic of the montenegrin republic , and dobrica cosic , president of the yugoslav federation for the first time , the three endorsed the international peace plan and urged bosnian serbs to accept it we have as much right to make decisions important to the serbian people as you do , and so we ask you to take our categorical position into consideration and accept the plan , their letter said this is a question of war and peace , and therefore we choose peace , a peace that is not only for serbia and montenegro but for all of you as well that peace is an honorable peace guaranteeing you equality and freedom the other possibility is an unnecessary war none of the three signers appeared in person , and it was unclear if the letter was merely a gesture aimed at influencing world opinion or a genuine expression of fear whatever the case , bosnian serb representatives ignored the letter and voted unanimously to reject the peace plan they have shown that they do n't care about the international community , lord owen said afterward we have to show that we are not prepared to let them get away with it map shows areas controlled by serbs , croats , and muslims and some croats
scratch any market participant , and you 're sure to find something of a hysteric , braced to think the worst on the slightest bit of bad news that fact emerged resoundingly over the past two weeks , as currency traders holding yen made a dash for the exits after a japanese political revolt doomed prime minister kiichi miyazawa s government , threatening decades of rule by his liberal democratic party for five months , economic fundamentals from the japanese trade surplus to signs of economic recovery had helped push the dollar down against the yen , to a record close of 10508 yen but on june 18 , when mr miyazawa lost a vote of confidence in the japanese diet , traders threw out fundamentals , pushing the dollar up more than three yen oops last week , the traders reversed again the yen rally revived , as traders sold dollars and bought japanese currency by friday , the dollar was trading just above 106 yen , near its level when the crisis erupted the selloff was largely a kneejerk reaction , said john lipsky , chief economist at salomon brothers indeed , none of the fundamentals from the trade surplus to the recovering economy changed in the diet vote and nearterm fiscal policy in japan was already set with passage of a budget and a supplement many currency traders knew that but they , like most everyone in the markets , are prisoners of perceptions that often outweigh reality think of a trader who , convinced that the diet vote should have little effect on the yen s value , did not change positions by week s end , that fictitious \( or now unemployed \) trader had a loss meanwhile , many of those traders who rode the perception that political turmoil in tokyo meant currency chaos won profits perception could well prove its importance again this week , with friday s release of american unemployment figures for june last year , when those were announced , a firestorm erupted unemployment grew to 78 percent in the month , from 75 percent in may 1992 , the government announced , with employment down 117 , 000 jobs minutes later , the federal reserve cut a key interest rate , and the markets moved accordingly white house advisers split about how positive thenpresident bush should be , with some arguing the figures did not reflect reality later , they were proved right revisions showed employment down only 16 , 000 jobs that month but perception was what mattered , helping win bond traders millions of dollars , and bill clinton the white house this week , the new figures arrive as mr clinton s budget rolls through congress if bad , they 're sure to be used against the package s tax increases even if they are inaccurate mr clinton could always argue about the numbers' reliability but perhaps last year s experience has taught him the lesson every bond trader will apply when you want to play to win , play to perceptions graphs the dow falls 388 to 3 , 49089 , tracks dow jones stock average , june 1724 , 1993 the dollar s rally proves brief , tracks dollar s value versus japanese yen , march 1june 24 , 1993 long bond rates keep sliding , tracks yield on 30year treasury bonds , may3june 24 , 1993
smithtown , li on long island , in the same suburbs that for decades have been considered prototypes of security , wealth and tranquillity , now comes the macabre i suppose the question for a lot of people is how this all could have happened on our quiet , treelined streets , said louis simpson , the poet and a long island resident for more than 20 years it is strange , but i think it is just coincidental , he said in a burst of defensiveness shared by many here i mean , really ! you could have three mass murders in indianapolis no mass murders , at least mass murders , thank goodness , have not been the problem but perhaps few crimes would have attracted such relentless publicity as those popping up on long island they include the case of katie beers , the 10yearold held captive in a subterranean bay shore bunker the sordid story of sol wachtler , the former chief judge of the state court of appeals , arrested in november on charges of threatening his former mistress and now under house arrest in manhasset , and the tawdry tale of amy fisher , the merrick 18yearold who has become known , through three madefortv movies and more media attention than is normally allotted to a small war , as the long island lolita it has all unfolded here , prompting many to raise an allbutimponderable question why here \? one jibe is that there must be something strange in the island s drinking water some are asking if the recession has been so deep and long that it is pushing long islanders over the brink into violence but to most people here , the cases of katie beers , amy fisher and sol wachtler are aberrations , strung together only by coincidence of geography and timing , and yield no deep secrets about life on the island still , long island has gained the unwanted distinction of being a national center of scandal and crime and therein lies a problem that may linger after the headlines obviously , this has all been negative for the island , said the rev tom hartman , a catholic priest and director of radio and television for the diocese of rockville centre there are a lot of people around the country that already view us as being an extension of new york city hard nosed , insensitive and money driven these stories just underscore that perception , he added i do worry , said mr simpson , a retired professor of literature at the state university of new york at stony brook and a recipient of the pulitzer prize for poetry people in the suburbs watch a lot of television , and it has a degrading effect they get an exaggerated sense of violence , and they lose proportion now , with these stories , it is all real , and suddenly it is right on top of them repelled and attracted the emotional response in schools , churches and synagogues , around dinner tables and in parking lots , has been complex and sometimes conflicting while many say they resent the media coverage , others admit to a strong tug of fascination it may be voyeurism , said ron craddock , manager of the smith haven shopping mall here , which was itself drawn briefly into the media blitz when miss fisher , on the day before her sentencing for shooting mary jo buttafuoco , came shopping for a new outfit , reporters in tow i did n't know she was here at the time , mr craddock said but with a smile and a slight blush , he added if i had , i would probably have wanted her autograph many long islanders now have personal stories of coming close to celebrity , or scandal you know , i 've seen him many times at the diner , said sylvia sones of massapequa , who was plodding through the mall here with her husband , lou , and their friends ted and esther zuckerman to most people in massapequa , mrs sones s reference to him would be obvious he is joseph buttafuoco , the man amy fisher says was her lover some are angry , less about the scandals than about the coverage i am appalled by the coverage , said carole kohlmar of east hampton , a retired librarian , as she made her way with her husband , matthew , through a throng of shoppers at the mall here the other day it titilates people , nothing more than that , said mr kohlmar , a retired history teacher he attributed the vast coverage to long island s proximity to the networks , magazines and major newspapers of new york city , and for what he called the worst of the media blitz he blamed checkbook journalism , and the ability of movie and television producers to turn real tragedy into hollywood fiction background in foreground but while few here welcome the attention , some say it was all but inevitable , given the backgrounds of those involved if amy fisher were black and living in harlem , that story would have gotten no more than firstday reporting , said father hartman but the fact that amy , and now katie beers , are white , suburban kids makes them more comfortable and easier for others in the nation s suburbs to relate to is it mere coincidence that long island is awash in scandal now \? perhaps not , he said long island is generally an affluent place , but we 've got a lot of people out of work and a collapsing realestate market , father hartman said we are dealing with the fact that we are no longer on the same economic plane as in the past , and maybe that has contributed to a sense of personal desperation that can push people over the edge to whatever extent the recession has played a role , many fear that the publicity has created a new hurdle , if only a small one , to recovery these are individual horrors that should not be associated in people s minds with long island , but they will be , said patricia poppiti of seldon , one of the smith haven mall shoppers will businesses be discouraged from moving to the island \? i do n't know , she said will some people have more trouble selling their homes \? it could be mrs poppiti said she had already been forced to defend long island against exaggerated fears of crime in her own job as an administrator of programs that bring european young people to the new york city area as exchange students and au pairs most people here are confident that the island will soon fade from the public s consciousness as a center of scandal and bizarre crimes my analysis is that long island , like other places , has its share of the abhorrent behavior , but for some strange reason it all came to the surface here this year , said james l larocca , president of the long island association , a business group who knows why \? but communities do survive these things a teenager s view perhaps least upset by the media blitz are the island s teenagers who better to judge a madefortv plot , fictional or real \? sure , this stuff is out of the ordinary , but big deal , said brian james , 17 , of sayville , as he emerged from the gap here with rob sholly , and simeon serrao , both of bohemia these things could happen anywhere , said mr sholly , 18 there is a lot of publicity , but it wo n't last none of this really matters to me photo sure , this stuff is out of the ordinary , but big deal , said brian james , left , regarding recent crimes on long island with friends rob sholly , center , and simeon serrao , mr james continued , these things could happen anywhere there is a lot of publicity , but it wo n't last none of this really matters to me \( vic delucia the new york times \)

yes , there s still passion in the art market , but only for objects that deserve it christie s sale of impressionist and modern paintings , drawings and sculptures last night showed not only that the slow but steady climb out of the last two years' doldrums continues , but also that if a work of art is special enough , collectors from all over the world will fight for it the evening s big surprise came early when degas s dancers taking a bow \( the ballerinas \) , from 1885 , sold for a staggering 7 million the work , which shows two dancers taking a curtain call , doubled its low estimate of 35 million the action for the painting was n't in the salesroom , but on the telephones several bidders vied for the work which was finally sold to an unidentified european collector the sale went off like a rocket , said christopher burge , the president of christie s obviously , there were some tough spots , but the market is still strong for fresh , attractive pictures bidding was totally

remainder , which the estimates do not take into account \) no takers for 'motherhood' the market is firmer and broader , said michael findlay , director of christie s impressionist and modern department each section of the market has advanced it was evenly balanced between impressionist and modern but just as there were some high notes in the evening , there were also some heavy blows the sale s other star work , renoir s motherhood or a woman nursing her son \( 1886 \) , failed to sell the painting , which depicts the painter s mistress , aline charigot , nursing their child , was expected to bring 8 million bidding never rose above 48 million experts said they were n't surprised the work was not new to the auction market it had previously been sold at sotheby s in 1988 , when it brought 8 million like most of the art market , things are still patchy , said julian agnew , a london dealer , after the sale indeed , works either tended to have lots of brisk bidding or practically none pissarro s market around the cathedral saintjacques , dieppe \( 1901 \) was particularly popular bids came from the salesroom and the telephone the work finally sold for 39 million to an unidentified american collector , just above christie s high estimate of 35 million it was n't the only pissarro to receive lots of attention so did beside the seine in paris \( pont marie , quai d'anjou \) , from 1888 , which , like the degas , sold for well above its high estimate the painting fetched 332 , 500 christie s had predicted it would bring 120 , 000 to 160 , 000 both pictures were from the estate of joseph s gruss , a new yorkbased financier and philanthropist who died in july other works from the gruss collection include van gogh s bouquet of flowers \( 1886 \) , estimated at 600 , 00 to 800 , 000 it sold for 14 million because estate material is fresh to the market , it tended to fare well , but works of art that have been up for sale recently did not miro s composition \( 1926 \) , which was being sold by the estate of peter j sharp , the real estate magnate who owned the carlyle hotel the brightly colored surrealist painting , estimated at 600 , 000 to 800 , 000 , sold for a respectable 563 , 500 return appearances in a precarious market , there are always the inevitable retreads like bonnard s nude in profile \( 1905 \) the painting , which was being sold by mrs pierre schlumberger , has been on the auction block more than once recently in may 1990 , it was up for sale at sotheby s in new york , where it failed to sell for a minimum of 1 million a year later , at sotheby s in london , it failed to sell again the highest bid was about 525 , 000 christie s had estimated it would sell for 300 , 000 to 400 , 000 last night , it sold , but barely , for 277 , 500 also making a return appearance last night was toulouselautrec s clown chaukao seated \( 1895 \) , which sold for for 28 million at sotheby s in london in november 1988 to hermann schnabel mr schnabel , a german collector and fertilizer manufacturer , was a major buyer at the height of the 1980 s boom , but recently he has been a major seller at christie s in may 1992 , he tried to sell 14 impressionist and modern works the lautrec was expected to sell for 14 million to 18 million last night and brought a surprising 12 million other paintings fared surprisingly well mondrian s composition with blue , red and yellow \( 1930 \) , estimated at 35 million to 45 million , was sold to an anonymous bidder for 35 million before the sale , experts had predicted there would be few takers , since the work had been heavily repainted kandinsky s murnau landscape with church i \( 1909 \) , also brought a respectable price christie s thought it would bring 28 million to 35 million an unidentified european collector paid 27 million a bellwether on picassos many experts were watching how christie s four picassos fared , given the 88 picassos from the collection of stanley j seeger that are to be auctioned at christie s on thursday evening of the four offered last night , only two found buyers , and just at their low estimates the ironer \( 1904 \) brought 530 , 500 , just above christie s low estimate of 500 , 000 , and the running of the bulls brought 421 , 500 , just above its low estimate of 400 , 000 people may be nervous in anticipation of those picassos coming up , mr findlay said we were surprised because we had seen interest on all four in hindsight , those that sold were of better quality as dealers were leaving the sale last night , most were pleased with the results clearly the market has turned a corner , said richard gray , a chicago dealer the reasonable estimates reflect what is the real market the impressionist and modern auctions continue tonight at sotheby s photo a detail from degas s dancers taking a bow \( the ballerinas \) , from 1885 the painting was sold for 7 million last night at christie s auction of impressionist and modern artworks , the first in two weeks of sales \( christie s new york \)
last year , in flaubert s latest , the playwright peter parnell had the brooding 19thcentury french novelist gustave flaubert materialize in an idyllic garden in litchfield county , conn drury pifer has gone him one better in a new comedy , receiving its premiere at the woolly mammoth theater in washington , he has the austere 19thcentury swedish playwright august strindberg and wife show up in presentday hollywood with nary a nod to the madness of the conceit , mr pifer calls his play quite simply strindberg in hollywood short of marie antoinette turning up at a howard johnson s , however , i ca n't imagine a better instance of the wrong person in the wrong place looking as if he had just stepped off a pedestal , a scowl permanently etched on his forehead , strindberg \( t j edwards \) is the embodiment of the tortured artist highminded and unyielding and here he is in the blissedout capital of compromise , where anything goes if it clinches the deal what s more , he s come to peddle the screen rights to one of his most vitriolic domestic dramas , the dance of death , and fully intends to write the screenplay himself his wife actually it s his third , the temperamental actress harriet bosse \( naomi jacobson \) is under the illusion that she will star in the film references to a certain arnold escape them so do the implications of the verb to rewrite words are important , he thunders at one point in a righteous tone that suggests he s climbed back up on the pedestal one word out of place and a star may disappear a child may die the picture s director , bluff otis de marko , subscribes to a slightly different principle the best word in a film script , he opines affably , is the word you scratch out de marko \( michael willis \) envisions the dance of death as an action flick about a police officer whose voluptuous wife is sleeping with their marriage counselor which is not exactly how strindberg pictured the battle of the sexes as for the swede s dour vision , it strikes the director that something happier might be more appropriate we are an upbeat people , he explains we invented panty hose we invented violence that does n't disturb the viewer we invented snow white excuse me , interrupts harriet the germans invented snow white this is where she made her career , de marko counters , nonplussed as long as mr pifer is chronicling the collisions of the old world and the new , the conflicting demands of art and junk , and the inevitable misunderstandings between the overwrought and the laid back , strindberg in hollywood , which runs through next sunday , has an engaging goofiness the play s fourth character , the actress micki kidde \( jennifer mendenhall \) is a marilyn monroe clone who is either on pills or on the phone much of the evening whenever she opens her mouth , it is usually to run reality a little further off the tracks mr pifer , however , is n't content just to churn out a satire of the movie industry and its idiotic ways , although he 'd probably be pretty good at it if he did he also wants to tap some of the fury that courses through strindberg s own plays , pitting suspicious men against avenging women strindberg and his wife are engaged in an intense lovehate relationship , as they were in real life that does n't stop him from coming under the dreamy spell of micki , whom he finds irresistible because she has no tradition , no history , no ballast holding her down sort of like the country itself how can anyone keep up with america \? strindberg marvels it s like a mirage , vanishing as you approach it once you venture beyond the vapidness of their hollywoodspeak , it s apparent that micki is hardly the freefloating creature strindberg takes her for and that coolhand de marko is really sweating nails they 're playing sexual games of their own , complicated by the fact that sex in hollywood inevitably involves billing and percentage points since harriet would n't mind exercising her wiles on de marko , a fourway dance of death is under way pretty soon , and it s not altogether in jest by the middle of the second act , mr pifer has worked himself not to mention his intransigent characters into a dramatic cul de sac he gets them out only with laborious effort , having exhausted the better part of his lunacy in the play s earlier stretches while the script abounds in pronouncements on a variety of topics from art to rock concerts , what we 're left with in the end , i fear , is that ageold piece of hollywood wisdom take the money and run not the note you expect an unconventional play like this to go out on under the direction of howard shalwitz , the four cast members carry on convincingly all the same over the years , the woolly mammoth has become washington s preferred home for plays offbeat and tripped out and it has fostered a performance style that usually complements the fare perfectly the actors have their feet on the ground , but their heads are in the ozone when they are really delirious , they are also deliriously real the fruitcakes they portray are made from authentic ingredients

there are probably too many paintings in christian schumann s first solo show at the postmasters gallery in soho there is so much going on in any one of them that initially it s hard to look at more than a few square inches at a time but mr schumann s teeming images , grafted together with singular precision , are one of the brighter spots in the season s first round of exhibitions , and cause for optimism about the state of painting mr schumann is very young at 23 he has lived in new york for only about two years \( he was born in rhode island , reared in texas and educated at the san francisco art institute \) he s also very talented , possessed of a graphic ability and a sense of color and composition that is , in its own sometimes oppressive way , unerring and authentic each schumann painting is a compressed , selfenclosed universe of image , abstraction and , usually , text , in which the innocent and the grotesque match wits , visual and otherwise sometimes this happens quite literally in untitled \( meanwhile pops busted his gears \) , a gruesome yet rather peaceful cadaver on a field of decaying red is juxtaposed with overlapping scenes of ducks , turtles and trees that suggest several pages of a children s book disconcertingly fused the background blocks of closetoned colors \( in this case blues and bluegreens \) , a frequent device , suggests a cheeredup ad reinhardt abstraction as might be guessed , mr schumann is into collage in a big way in fact , the best works in the show , because they have the most breathing room , tend to be paintings made almost entirely of collaged drawings but whether working with paper , paint or on julian schnabellike pieces of found tarpaulin , the artist has embraced wholeheartedly the shallow , piecedtogether surfaces and juxtaposed images of 80 s painting in a moment when the achievements of that decade are often obscured by the crazed market and publicity it generated , mr schumann s willingess to learn from the 80 s is a healthy sign his many precedents include not only mr schnabel , but also david salle , carroll dunham , donald baechler , jeanmichel basquiat and tim rollins and kos , to name but a few other possible influences are the comicinspired art of jim shaw and , in the penchant for animated oozing shapes and suggestive piles , as well as the stuffedanimal imagery , mike kelley mr schumann s 18 paintings , all made this year , draw from high and low culture \( mostly low \) , from cartoons and comics of every ilk , from science fiction and greeting cards and children s books , layering the good , the bad and the ugly with hints of abstraction they also speak , incorporating shopsign names , bits of found letters , cryptic jokes for a sense of the artist s writing voice , see the paperedon text that begins boy oh boy o chicken head this is it along the bottom edge of porkpie , a 6footby5foot canvas whose dozens of small collaged drawings include images of a brain , various intestines , faces and intergalactic mutants what s impressive is mr schumann s ability to corral so many diverse sources into a territory and a streamofconsciousness fullness that seems very much his own contrary to much art of the 80 s and 90 s , he skirts appropriation and avoids irony altogether familiar as his images may be , they are culled mostly from his own personal , albeit mediainfused image bank and drawn by hand his work often has an indelibly rural flavor and a hokey teenage humor back at porkpie , a small drawing of a straining manacled hand has the caption , oh , do n't worry about frankie none he do n't like nobody lessen they brought him some meat he also plays 80 s painting against the hinterlands not only mad magazine and r crumb but also suggestions of idiosyncratic painters from beyond the pale of the new yorklos angeles axis , like peter saul , jim nutt and william wiley like mr nutt in particular , mr schumann puts a tightly realistic painting technique to nonrealistic ends , creating an almost northern renaissance surface that expunges all signs of new york school painterliness and he sharpens it with a trick of his own applying paint to wax paper and then transferring it to canvas , which results in thin layers of crinkled or slightly flaking images and colors that seem on the verge of peeling off to reveal other images , other slightly mad worlds , beneath this technique is one of several means by which mr schumann has flattened 80 s collage into an infinitesimally thin yet layered and physically appealing surface despite his obviously fertile imagination and narrative sense , what is most distinctive about his art is this sharp taut surface , built of little blocks of color or paper , forming a space that is at once tightly compartmentalized and fractured , open , flowing and whole this show exudes a sometimes too youthful energy , but it is nonetheless crowded with possibility christian schumann s paintings will remain at postmasters gallery , 80 greene street in soho , through oct 9 photo a detail of los invasores , by christian schumann \( postmasters gallery \)
for the second time in a month , an understanding client is permitting a fortunate agency to begin building a twocar garage porsche cars north america inc in reno said yesterday that it would move its estimated 10 million account , which had been at fallon mcelligott in minneapolis for the last five years , to goodby , berlin silverstein in san francisco , effective immediately the sleek , expensive sports cars will share space in the goodby garage with american isuzu motors inc , an estimated 95 million account that the agency has handled since august 1991 it helps , of course , that the vehicles sharing the twocar garage at goodby and at mullen advertising inc , which is now handling rollsroyce and bmw are not directly competitive indeed , the people who buy porsches and rollsroyces may well also own a fourwheeldrive vehicle like the isuzu trooper or a sporty luxury car like a bmw they impressed us with their automotive experience , richard s ford , porsche s vice president of sales and marketing , said in a telephone interview from goodby s office the fact that goodby already had an automotive account was a plus , he added goodby was awarded the account following a twomonth review in which none of the other finalists had auto accounts goodby s competitors were the richards group in dallas and stein robaire helm in los angeles a fourth finalist , goldberg moser o'neill in san francisco , unexpectedly withdrew from the review last week in doubling up on automotive accounts , goodby joins mullen in wenham , mass , which on feb 11 was named the surprise winner of the 80 million to 85 million bmw of north america inc account , previously at ammirati puris in new york mullen also handles the estimated 5 million account of rollsroyce motor cars inc in lyndhurst , nj , the american importer of rollsroyces and bentleys from britain in each case , the automotive client already at the agency gave its blessing to an unorthodox , lenient interpretation of traditional client conflict rules usually , advertisers , particularly in intensively competitive categories like cars , zealously and jealously protect their agency relationships even a hint of interest in a rival s account can often result in an agency s abrupt dismissal now , however , there seems to be some relaxation of those rigid attitudes it s indicative of the fact marketers are trying to find people who can do the job , be partners with them , rather than getting caught up with who else the agency handles , jeff goodby , a coprincipal and cocreative director at goodby , said rich silverstein , the agency s other coprincipal and cocreative director , said , clients are willing to go where they think they can get the best work mr ford of porsche said goodby was selected late tuesday , after the three finalists made strategic presentations last week and were interviewed one more time earlier this week what we saw here was a culture marriage , he added the chemistry s just right goodby will begin producing porsche s advertising for the rest of the 1993 model year , according to mr ford , and will develop a campaign to introduce a redesigned porsche 911 next march porsche has ambitious plans to bring out new models , like the 986 , a lowerpriced porsche , to try to reverse a steep sales slump in this country sales in the united states , which peaked in 1986 at 30 , 471 , plunged to 4 , 115 last year mr silverstein said that an important aspect of goodby s work for porsche would be not to talk just to existing porsche owners , who are very loyal , but to people who could afford to buy a porsche , but do n't mr silverstein himself owns a porsche carrera 4 , a 911 with fourwheel drive , which mr goodby joked was off limits to agency staff members who wanted test drives during goodby s efforts to land the account the porsche account is another major gain for goodby , which this week was named no 5 on adweek s list of the 30 hottest us agencies of 1992 , as well as agency of the year for 1992 by adweek s western regional edition porsche drives onto a client roster that also includes among recent arrivals the estimated 40 million sega of america account and an estimated 30 million assignment from norwegian cruise lines adweek estimated goodby s billings , before porsche , at 1664 million mr goodby and mr silverstein called that figure a low number , but declined to be more specific mr ford said that while porsche s billings were just under 10 million , the needle can move upward in future years mr goodby said , we 're thinking ahead for them , coming up with a position that will work for five or 10 years , not just to sell next year s models porsche s decision ends , for now , a tumultuous twoyear period during which 14 relationships between auto makers and their agencies were disrupted besides porsche , eight car makers changed agencies \( volvo , subaru , isuzu , mercedesbenz , jaguar , infiniti , alfa romeo and bmw \) , three left the american market \( peugeot , sterling and daihatsu \) and one aborted its introduction \( mazda s amati division \) in one case , general motors' oldsmobile division , the account was placed in review , but the agency , leo burnett usa in chicago , managed to retain it photos jeff goodby , left , and rich silverstein of goodby , berlin silverstein feel their advertising agency was able to land a second automobile account because clients want the best work \( goodby , berlin silverstein \)
new rochelle , ny , july 30 seven people were wounded early today outside a downtown nightclub after onstage taunting between a rap artist and the audience provoked a gunman to open fire , spraying a panicky crowd fleeing into the street two of the injuries were serious enough to require surgery , but none were considered lifethreatening nevertheless , the shooting , which ended when a police officer wounded the gunman , was another instance of violence marring a rap event although there have been many peaceful rap concerts , in december 1991 , nine young people were crushed to death waiting to enter a basketball game among rap entertainers at a city college gymnasium today s violence also was another psychological blow to this city of 67 , 000 , which experienced a night of looting and vandalism after the first verdict in april 1992 in the rodney g king beating case in los angeles and has also struggled to shore up its downtown after a devastating fire in 1991 and the closing of its major retailer , macy s avoiding rap performers the shooting took place at the palace , a popular nightclub in a faded threestory art deco building at 518 main street along a downtown stretch of us route 1 the club has been operated virtually without incident for 17 years by napoleon holmes , the longtime president of the local chapter of the naacp , and entertainers have included joe williams and jerry butler mr holmes said he had banished rappers after a crowd got out of hand at an event in 1991 featuring the rap artist heavy d he said he had been told by a promoter that the thursday night concert would feature rhythm and blues performers and when he learned rap performers were coming , it was kind of too late to pull out shortly after 2 15 am today , more than 150 patrons were gathered at rows of small tables and on a dance floor to listen to lorda finesse , an aspiring twoman rap group one of the rappers traded insults with members of the audience , proclaiming his lyrics as the best in the business and deriding one person as chicken mr holmes said a gold chain was snatched off the neck of one performer by someone in the audience and a fistfight broke out drawn guns , a fleeing crowd sgt edward sheehy , a detective with the new rochelle police , said that within minutes after the clamor erupted , three guns , including a pistol with machinegun firing capability and a long clip , were drawn the crowd rushed towards the back and out the main street doors the street , between church and division streets , is a handsome smalltown block of two and threestory shop buildings that include a florist and drugstore one man , identified by the police as harry andrews , 25 , of the melrose section of the bronx , followed the crowd outside and sprayed his gun indiscriminately and in a wide arc , the police said they said it was unclear whether mr andrews was in the audience or accompanied the rap performers to the club one bullet struck the jaw of anthony almeida , who was driving north along main street in his toyota and heard a bullet shatter his passengerside windshield , the police said other bullets struck or grazed five young men , aged 18 to 25 , who had been at the concert , the police said mr andrews returned inside the club and was confronted by one of the four security guards , the police said there was a quick exchange of fire and then mr andrews fled back outside , the police say by this time new rochelle police officers had arrived sergeant sheehy said mr andrews fired across main street at officer john turdo officer turdo , a veteran of more than 10 years on the force , fired back twice , sergeant sheehy said , striking mr andrews in one hand and one knee arraignment in the hospital the wounded mr andrews was handcuffed and his weapon seized and in the afternoon he was arraigned at new rochelle hospital medical center for the attempted murder of a police officer the police said two other men who brandished guns escaped , but one of their weapons , a silver 38caliber revolver , was picked up sergeant sheehy declined to identify the four hospitalized victims until police interviews were completed one had been shot in the abdomen and another in the chest a seventh man , rasul salahudein , 20 , of mount vernon , who had been grazed by a bullet , was treated and released , he said by early afternoon , blood was still splattered across the tiled vestibule of the building , once the palace shoestore the deep blue glass facade , with two brass lamps flanking the doorway , was decorated today with spinning green and red lights and posters for nelson mandela and malcolm x sergeant sheehy said the toll of seven wounded was the worst incidence of violence in this city since 1977 , when frederick w cowan , a disgruntled worker , went on a rampage in the neptune worldwide moving company warehouse , killing six people , including a police officer , before shooting himself to death there was some disagreement over how the guns got into the club gene smith , the club s manager , said all people entering the club were scanned by handheld metal detectors he said the gunman fled outside and returned with the gun but sergeant sheey said three guns were drawn inside the club motivation to quit mr holmes said the guns might have been carried in equipment brought in by the rap performers and their disk jockey the 62yearold mr holmes said despite his policy on rap concerts he has wanted to give young people a place to spend time young people have nowhere to go , nothing to do , he said yet , he said , his friends and customers have been stunned at violence in a place that has operated peacefully for so long the club s reputation is so strong that it was chosen as the site for a benefit saturday by an association of black corrections officers for a slain fellow officer i have been trying to get out of the business , mr holmes said and this may be the straw that broke the camel s back photo a police officer investigating the crime scene yesterday on main street in new rochelle where seven people were wounded early in the morning fleeing a rap

the national football league kicks off its 74th season today it could be called the open season or the year of the oneshot deal there has never been one like it it may never be duplicated labor peace and the league s first collective bargaining agreement with its players since the 1986 season has resulted in a new freeagency system where more than 100 players switched teams this year but the rules change drastically next year this year most players with five years of experience whose contracts had expired could move freely to new teams next year the number of years required will most likely be reduced to four there was a rookie salary cap this year but no over all salary cap for the league s 28 teams next year , a cap projected between 31 and 35 million per team is expected already , according to most estimates , at least half of the teams' payrolls are above next year s cap projections the question facing each nfl franchise for the 1993 season was this do we dive headfirst into free agency and worry about reductions next year when the cap arrives \? or should we be frugal , take our hits and exploit the market next season when so many teams will already be in trouble with the cap \? some teams notably atlanta , detroit , kansas city , the jets , miami , phoenix and green bay were among the teams that said , hey , let s go for it next year is next year it s open season , they surmised let s make a oneshot deal to get to the super bowl everything that has happened here is a direct result of us making that one shot to get to the big show , especially since it is here , said chris miller , the atlanta falcons quarterback , of the spending his team did in an effort to reach super bowl xxviii jan 30 in the georgia dome among the falcons' freeagent signings were quarterback bobby hebert from new orleans , running back eric dickerson from the raiders , cornerback melvin jenkins from detroit and defensive linemen pierce holt from san francisco and jumpy geathers from washington detroit spent as much as 13 million on three linemen to block for barry sanders \( david lutz from kansas city , bill fralic from atlanta and david richards from san diego \) kansas city traded for joe montana and spent big dollars for marcus allen the jets signed a bushel of veteran free agents including ronnie lott and leonard marshall miami rushed for keith byars and others , and phoenix signed gary clark , then sought more freeagent talent on offense to complement him packers go for quick fix few teams were as daring as the green bay packers , who spent 30 million on free agency and landed the top prize , defensive end reggie white , paying him 18 million , including 9 million up front in signing bonuses let me make this point , said robert harlan , packers president and chief executive officer no one is more happy about revenue sharing and the eventual salary cap than we are , especially being from a small market we were also active in the past in plan b and we certainly have been active in this new free agency we felt this was our one chance to immediately improve this team and to contend ron wolf , our general manager , and coach mike holmgren felt we had one of the weakest defensive lines in the league last year these are very aggressive people and the best management team we 've had in my 23 years here we know we 'll have to make some changes like a lot of other teams next year but this is this year there is a great deal of excitement the race is on to find which teams jell quickest and which ones made the best moves the answers begin unfolding today linemen get the money at last the season should be fastpaced and full of intrigue off the field as well a new television contract will be negotiated during the season in october the league will decide on two new expansion teams from a field of five candidates charlotte , nc baltimore jacksonville , fla memphis , and st louis this is a year when offensive linemen finally received the dollars to back up the words frequently offered on how important they are among the big winners , besides detroit s trio , were a pair sought by denver brian habib and don maggs who both signed for nearly 2 million per year what to look for on field it is also a season when the 49ers' passing attack is becoming a protoype for others in the nfl look for many teams to move to a shorter drop for the quarterback and quicker and shorter passes to receivers hoping to turn them into long gains the dallas cowboys are trying to become repeat champions and the rest of the league is trying to match the cowboys' youth , quickness and speed several teams will also copy a trend the cowboys made popular last season , using a wave of defensive linemen to help keep their front fresh when the minnesota vikings visit the los angeles raiders this afternoon in the refurbished los angeles coliseum , history will be made in the nfl two black head coaches , dennis green of the vikings and art shell of the raiders , match wits for the first time more black coaches have gained opportunity in the nfl than ever before this is in part because of the minority fellowship program in which black college coaches work with nfl teams in training camp a record number of 50 , including 16 former nfl players , participated in the program this year , more than 230 have been involved since the program began in 1987 and 11 current nfl assistants are graduates of the program afc tries harder the nfl prides itself on parity and many around the league would love to see one trend end the nfc s recent reign in super bowl victories it is nine and counting and the nfc east has won the last three the buffalo bills , of course , have lost the last three everybody expects us to just pack it in , said bills defensive end bruce smith i do n't think so we 're still hungry we 've learned from every year , every trip i think we 'll still be the team to beat in the afc buddy ryan , the houston oilers' new defensive coordinator , does not agree with smith i came here to help this team get to the super bowl and nothing short of that will be accepted , ryan said we 're good and we 're going to get better we 'll change some things in the afc an nfc presence things have already changed in the afc , especially with the arrival of bill parcells in new england and montana s presence in kansas city montana this year will help provide marquee quarterback matchups throughout the season in week 2 he is matched against houston s warren moon , in week 3 and week 15 he battles denver s john elway and in week 13 it is buffalo s jim kelly the good thing about that , montana said , chuckling , is i do n't have to play defense against them i know those are games that everyone will be watching pittsburgh s bill cowher and san diego s bobby ross want to show that their first nfl seasons as head coaches 115 records and divisional championships were not flukes cowher said you have to prove yourself over and over again in this league and i welcome the challenge we can be just as successful , maybe even more despite all of the change in the nfl , dallas enters as a popular super bowl favorite , a position that will be enhanced when running back emmitt smith solves his contract squabbles and joins the fold it is a new free agency system it is the open season it is a oneshot deal none of that matters much to me , said dallas coach jimmy johnson just give me the rules and make sure everybody else abides by them and we 're good enough and have enough ego to think that we can still beat them all
dublin , may 23 john hume , the most influential roman catholic political leader in northern ireland , said today that despite recent bombings by the irish republican army he would continue to seek the framework of a peace agreement with gerry adams , president of sinn fein , the ira s political wing protestant leaders and others in the british province have criticized both men as the ira detonated three car bombs since thursday , the day the vote count started after local elections in the province more than 20 people have been wounded , none gravely the ira justifies violence as a way to force the british to relinquish power sinn fein declines to condemn the ira violence , and for this reason is excluded from peace talks involving britain , the irish republic and the other political parties in the north mr hume , in an interview in dublin , said he and mr adams , who is usually his political enemy , would meet again soon in the north to try to agree on a framework that could lead to full negotiations to end the civil war he declined to disclose details of the two sessions he has had with mr adams since early april political analysts said they expected the humeadams talks to reach a crucial point in the next week or so , and mr hume was described by some as feeling an agreement was close , but not without danger of collapsing what we are talking about , mr hume said , is how to give expression to selfdetermination to all the people who live on the island of ireland in northern ireland political parlance , this means a referendum in the north and in the irish republic , here in the south , to determine whether ireland should remain partitioned into an independent state and a british province it implies that a united ireland , excluding any british control , would require a vote of approval by the majorities in both the north , where there are 900 , 000 protestants and 650 , 000 catholics , and the overwhelmingly catholic south but before there could be such a vote , the ira would have to stop its violence long enough to give the british government reason to believe that a peaceful settlement was possible , and to allow sinn fein to represent the ira in official peace negotiations the first step , mr hume is believed to be telling mr adams , is to redefine the war s essential cause until now , the ira has insisted that the british presence is the chief problem , while mr hume and other moderates insist that the basic trouble is between the two traditions , the euphemism for irish people who are catholics or protestants an agreement between mr hume and mr adams would presumably note that the british are no longer the principal problem

pittsburgh , dec 19 with the lingering specter of teammate jeff alm s suicide immediately behind them and with the exhilarating anticipation of a divisional crown at their fingertips , the houston oilers forged ahead , not backward , and made this afternoon at three rivers stadium special for all of the right reasons they dispatched the pittsburgh steelers by 2617 with a quick start and a strong finish and afterward said they would send a game ball to alm s parents last tuesday , the oilers were transfixed in grief today , they celebrated life and winning going into this game , everybody had no 76 on their minds , said oilers linebacker lamar lathon of alm , the oiler defensive tackle who last week killed himself with a shotgun blast after his best friend was killed in their singlecar accident in houston alm had been driving the car this thing kind of opened guys' eyes up to life , oiler linebacker al smith said it taught us about not letting opportunities pass it reminded us that tomorrow is not guaranteed and , as far as football , it showed us that to make up a loss next week or even next year just would n't do maybe that , in part , explains how the oilers wearing no 76 stickers on their helmets started so furiously , so ferociously , so meticulously before 57 , 592 fans on their first drive , which began with the opening kickoff , houston moved with gusto from its 20 to the pittsburgh 38 with wicked warren moon passes and relentless gary brown runs then , showing that they had done their homework , the oilers caught pittsburgh in the allout blitz that had been so successful last monday night at miami and hit the steelers where they hurt , with a screen pass to brown brown enjoyed a full complement of blockers leading the screen he did the rest he ran down the right sideline and made the perfect cut into the middle and into the end zone eight plays eighty yards houston , 70 pittsburgh s offense then got the ball , lost a yard on a run , ran for 5 yards and then tried a pass over the middle with the rush coming into quarterback neil o 'donnell s face oilers safety bo orlando was waiting , intercepted the pass and scored a 38yard screen pass to brown touchdown a 38yard interception return by orlando touchdown just like that , the runfirst , plodding pittsburgh offense trailed by 140 houston would jump ahead by 200 before leading by 203 at halftime we had n't won here since 1989 , said orlando , and it s funny , but that s usually what happens to us here they get the big play on offense , they get the turnover we had the blitz on on my play and the back stayed in to block so , i read and followed the quarterback s eyes and it led me right to the ball nine in a row for oilers many fans thought the oilers , the team that suffered the biggest collapse in national football league history in their playoff loss at buffalo last season , would not be equal to the task against pittsburgh some thought the oilers would wallow in their own pity rather than win their ninth straight game , improve to a 104 record and clinch the american conference central division title instead , pittsburgh fell to 86 and lost a chance to gain a tie for the division lead i knew they would come out hungry with so much at stake , steelers cornerback d j johnson said they got us out of sync early , and once you do that to us it s hard to make things happen pittsburgh outscored houston by 73 in each of the last two quarters but could not overcome its poor start although the oilers lost leading receiver webster slaughter for the season when he suffered torn ligaments in his left knee on the second play of the second quarter , the houston passing attack was n't seriously affected warren moon \( 19 of 38 , 268 yards , 1 touchdown , no interceptions \) completed five passes to ernest givins \( 71 yards \) and four each to brown \( 80 yards \) and receiver gary wellman \( 59 yards \) brown added 100 yards rushing on 20 carries the steelers being out of sync \? they wo n't often rush 18 times and pass 57 times o 'donnell \( 15 for 37 , 256 yards , four sacks , a touchdown and one pass intercepted \) started , mike tomczak \( 9 of 20 , 144 yards , two sacks , one touchdown , two passes intercepted \) finished and the steelers receivers did not help by dropping a bushel of passes pittsburgh , without pro bowl running back barry foster , out for the season with an ankle injury , finished with only 38 rushing yards after entering with a 1318 per game average , best in the afc you get down by 140 and then by 200 , you throw tempo is everything our first priority for this game was to focus on that first drive , either by the offense or the defense , said oilers receiver haywood jeffires setting the tempo against the steelers means everything they want to play ballcontrol we wanted them in a catchup mode when we got back to the locker room , warren stood up and spoke and said this game was for jeff and the game ball for his parents then jack joined in and you know jack he said a couple of words and clapped his hands twice and that was about it we said a team prayer and a prayer for jeff we feel good for jack we feel good for ourselves in the way we have handled adversity and why not \? the oilers and their coach , jack pardee , have been through storms ever since that collapse at buffalo last season the offense jelled today and the defense made six sacks , recovered a fumble and , in the end , thwarted pittsburgh s lastditch drive for a touchdown at the houston 16 with 39 seconds jeffires concluded sure , we lost at buffalo in the playoffs in the worst comeback we could imagine now we 've won the division after all that has happened to us , the 14 start , everything i call this one of the greatest comebacks in the history of this league and , all the oilers would agree , a celebration of life and winning photo in a tribute to teammate jeff alm , who committed suicide last week , oilers players bruce matthews , left , mike munchak and stan thomas , right , joined the team in a moment of silence before their game against the steelers in pittsburgh yesterday afternoon \( reuters \)
riyadh , saudi arabia in a highstakes gamble for king fahd and his western allies , including the united states , saudi arabia is fighting a wave of islamic fundamentalist opposition and demands for democratic reforms by tightening one of the most confining political systems in the middle east the measures , which followed a period of liberalization during the persian gulf crisis , have included the arrest and imprisonment of militant clerics , a refusal to grant promised political reforms and tighter press censorship , including a ban on the import of satellite dishes king fahd , whose family has ruled the country since 1902 , is relying on an authoritarian system that does not permit political parties or the right to vote for national and provincial governments and denies freedom of speech , assembly and association but the approach has risks for the king if demands from the westerneducated elite for liberal reforms are ignored , the rigidity of the system may move many in the opposition , especially the young , to embrace islamic fundamentalism close ties to us if the pressure for change erodes the hold of the saud dynasty , a western diplomat said , it will be a major blow for the united states , which fought the war in the gulf to safeguard not only kuwait s oil fields , but those in saudi arabia a country of 17 million , saudi arabia is of paramount importance to the united states' strategic interests in the region , especially with saddam hussein still in power in iraq and the islamic government of iran seeking to acquire an array of military equipment , from russian submarines to nuclear technology united states attacks on southern iraq have included strikes by warplanes based in saudi arabia , and the saudi government is playing a growing role in providing oil and jobs for the united states saudi arabia has increased oil exports to the united states 10fold in the last five years , to 18 million barrels a day it is the united states' biggest foreign supplier , with 24 percent of all oil imports in the same period , it has doubled its purchase of american goods , buying 8 billion in merchandise the increase in american imports alone translates into 50 , 000 american jobs , according to a senior diplomat and that figure does not include the 25 billion saudi arabia has spent on american military equipment since the end of the gulf war , including a 9 billion order for 72 advanced f15 fighters malaise is apparent but there seems to be a malaise in the kingdom , where gleaming shopping malls and luxury sedans often exude a sense of well being and security the prosperity of past years is no longer a given the government no longer guarantees saudi college graduates a job , and private businesses , which prefer cheaper and often bettereducated foreign workers , employ only 10 percent of the workers in saudi arabia who are of saudi origin even those who find work must accept wages that have been frozen for a decade the emerging economic troubles are in sharp contrast with the opulent life of the royal family , who now number in the thousands the practice by some of members of the ruling family of skimming up to 30 percent commissions off business deals has led to charges of widespread mismanagement and corruption by the country s business sector and the ostentatious palaces erected for young princes along palmlined avenues have set many saudis grumbling welfare state erodes the government is saddled with budget deficits that have begun to eat away at the lavish welfare state schools are overcrowded , there is a shortage of hospital beds , and sections of jidda receive water only two days a week saudi citizens today have fewer civil and political rights than they had 60 years ago , said a recent report by the human rights group middle east watch the decline in living standards , especially in a country where half the population is under 18 , has fueled disenchantment in egypt a corrupt minister will at least recognize that he is stealing public money , a prominent businessman said , but here they do not the royal family has come to believe that they own the whole country they even see the people as their property saudi officials dismiss the internal criticism as insignificant , but at the same time the statecontrolled media have begun a campaign against both islamic fundamentalism and liberal westernstyle democracy consultative council delayed government supporters point to the king s promise to appoint a 61man consultative council , which while it will not have the power to legislate , will be able to discuss and interpret laws but the members of the council have yet to be announced despite a september deadline , and the press is no longer allowed to speculate about when it will be formed the government contends that those who criticize it , including many who have sent petitions calling for change to the king , have refused opportunities to push for reforms from within many of the people who signed these petitions have no guts to really go out and work through the organized system for change , a member of the royal family said there are changes we have the consultative council there is more and more structured participation
my mother did n't care much about food , but she loved going to restaurants to her they were the best kind of theater , and when i was growing up we made weekly pilgrimages to see the latest show look , she cried , pulling me into the fledgling four seasons , they change the sets every three months ! the 1950 s and 60 s were a halcyon time for her she was constantly dragging us off to places that served ale by the yard then new york restaurants started concentrating on food , and mom more or less lost interest so you 'll understand why she was so excited about the opening of the river cafe in 1977 mom could n't understand why i would n't rush right home from california to see this wonder it took me a couple of years and by the time i got there , i was an utter disappointment to her mom was like a kid , picking out buildings across the river , pointing out the boats i thought it was pretty fabulous too new york s best bridge hovers just over your head and lady liberty toasts you off to the left still , it was the food that captured my attention it was wonderful stuff this room with a view might have made the food irrelevant , but the river cafe had greater ambitions it has been a seminal restaurant in the annals of new american food larry forgione virtually declared the independence of american cuisine when he began cooking here , pioneering the use of regional american ingredients when he left to open an american place , first charles palmer \( now at aureole \) and then david burke \( now at park avenue cafe \) carried on the tradition people might have come to the river cafe for the view , but they came back for the food that s why it s so disappointing to discover that the current kitchen , under john loughran , is so sloppy it s still possible to be enchanted by the food here , but it is also possible to encounter a total disaster of a meal consider one recent meal when we pulled up for dinner at 9 pm , there was a breathtaking moment as we turned into the parking lot and saw the masses of lights twinkling in the trees we were seated at once i 've never waited for a table here and the waiter rushed over with the first offerings free food is always nice , and i was grateful for the demitasse of carrotginger soup but it was accompanied by soggy little rolls of sushi made of couscous not the smartest idea i 've ever encountered which fell apart when you put them to your lips there is a prixfixe meal at 58 for a 6 supplement we got lobster salad with grilled vegetables and orzo as one of the appetizers the lobster was so tasteless that blindfolded i could not possibly have told you what it was , and if you 'd asked about the orzo salad i would have said it was chilled rice pudding the other appetizer was not much better sea scallops en croute was very pretty , but the dough was tough , the scallops were bland and the only really appealing part of the dish was the asparagus sauce the worst appetizer i had here was something called chilled sweet roasted pepper consomme with grilled shrimp and pepper bow ties how any chef could have allowed this to leave the kitchen is beyond me the soup looked like dishwater and tasted like scorched vegetables the soggy little bow ties of pasta floating unhappily in the water did n't help main courses were no improvement moroccan glazed monkfish and smoked shrimp falafels turned out to be sweet , soggy , overcooked fish with truly horrible , doughy little balls masquerading as falafel a hefty veal chop topped with a generous piece of sauteed foie gras was in a sauce so salty i could hardly eat it and why , in the middle of summer , resort to carrots and zucchini \?

an astonishing victory emerged from the royal viking instant matchpoint game , which was organized by the american contract bridge league and played in clubs throughout north america thursday night the winners , playing at the winfield hall club in westchester , pa , were carole siegel , who has 20 master points , and susan strauss , who has none at all and does not belong to the national group they scored almost 75 percent in the northsouth line , and are surely the least experienced pair ever to win on such an occasion the eastwest winners , with 73 percent , were bill cook and annette mchann of jackson , miss the best scores in the new york metropolitan area were northsouth , gladys collier of east hampton , li , and albert barbanel of riverhead , li , with 67 percent and eastwest , robert and hanneke gold of amagansett , li , with 65 percent on the diagramed deal , north normally overcalled the weak twospade opening with four notrump , showing both minor suits if south guessed to bid five clubs rather than five diamonds the play was tricky if west led his singleton diamond to the queen and ace , east had to return a spade , resisting the temptation to give his partner a ruff south could then win in his hand and lead the diamond ten , tempting west to ruff he had to throw a heart , not a spade , so that he could throw another heart if south won the diamond king and ruffed a diamond with the club queen with that defense south failed that suggests that south was wrong to bid five clubs holding strength in both major suits , he would have made a good gamble if he had surprised his partner by passing four notrump that contract is unbeatable , for after a spade lead , won with the ace , north can unblock the heart ace and lead the diamond king to establish 10 tricks diagram
attorney general janet reno surely made a popular call when she approved the indictment of sheik omar abdel rahman and 14 others on charges of conspiring to levy a war of urban terrorism against the united states , and other crimes since the deadly february bomb attack at new york city s world trade center , new yorkers especially have felt vulnerable to international terrorism for many , the sheik , with his inflammatory preaching and the bloody deeds attributed to his followers , has come to symbolize the danger in the short run , the indictment could provoke further terrorism and its dependence on a rarely used law and on the taped testimony of a government informant may make it vulnerable in court still , given the legal options available to her , the attorney general s popular call was also the right call fear of new violence from mr abdel rahman s supporters cannot justify overlooking evidence of his criminal involvement and putting him on trial in the united states is more likely to produce trustworthy information and assure due process than extraditing him to egypt or deporting him to afghanistan federal investigators still have not been able to pin any direct involvement in overt terrorist actions on sheik abdel rahman prosecutors instead brought charges under a seditiousconspiracy law first used against diehard confederates after the civil war these charges were backed by testimony from the informant , some of it on tape , that appeared to place mr abdel rahman in discussions of the political and religious implications of potential bombing targets the indictment also accuses him of conspiring to assassinate president mubarak of egypt during a planned official visit to new york mr abdel rahman , whose main goal all along has seemed to be the overthrow of secular government in his home country of egypt , was tried on similar terrorist conspiracy charges there more than a decade ago and was acquitted after that he spent time in the sudan and pakistan , helping the ciabacked islamic rebels in afghanistan despite being on a list of excludables , he was repeatedly granted visas to enter the united states visas approved , as it happened , by cia agents assigned to the us consulate in khartoum , the sudan some of the crimes in the indictment , notably the murder of rabbi meir kahane , were committed before mr abdel rahman took up residence in this country nevertheless the indictment names him as a leader of the purported terrorist organization the overt acts of terrorism described in the indictment were said to be carried out by lowerlevel operatives since some of the alleged organization s members remain at large , there s at least a chance of further incidents and since the indictment asserts that one of the accused conspirators , el sayyid a nosair , plotted further terrorist acts after his imprisonment , even detention seems no guarantee of deterrence two months ago ms reno decided not to seek indictment of mr abdel rahman , reasoning that an unsuccessful prosecution might do more harm than none at all what later changed her mind was more careful study of the available evidence and the realization that conspiracy charges would allow prosecutors to admit evidence in court that might otherwise be ruled out in the end , she and her top advisers , including mary jo white , the us attorney for new york s southern district , made a politically and legally sound judgment by putting their faith in american law and american courts , they best served the interests of justice , due process and the fight against international terrorism

rapidly bringing the cable and phone industries together , rendering current regulations obsolete so mr gore s announcement was really a bow to the inevitable what he did not spell out is exactly what role the government will play in this confusing new world feeding people , not dealers a lot of people will be eating leftovers today some stumbling to the refrigerator at halftime through a sea of wrapping paper , some out in the cold , picking at garbage homelessness is a wrenching sign of our times , but many people balk at handing out money , fearing that it will go for drugs last week , though , a community group on manhattan s upper west side had another idea sell people vouchers , redeemable for food , to be given to the needy the attraction is clear a chance to stop feeding the drug dealers and start feeding people in need , said one community group member yes , there were critics aplenty this is just another way to avoid dealing with the real problems , said one another saw the vouchers becoming just another form of street currency but the hungry ca n't dine on lofty debates eloise was surely there there s no earthly reason why a wedding should be business news , but somehow it would seem an omission not to report that donald trump and marla maples completed their friendly merger last week at the plaza but enough on that a future for grand central new yorkers know in their hearts that the vaulting glory of grand central belongs to them in spirit , they 're right in cold fact , they 're not it s owned by penn central , which rents it to the metropolitan transportation authority penn central at times has toyed with the idea of building a tower on top , and the mta , a nervous renter , has put off renovations but last week the two parties signed a new 110year lease that peter stangl , head of the mta , called a win for everybody for penn central , more rent for the mta , a green light for a 100 million renovation for those who love the terminal , no tower deming a man of quality a decade or so ago , when three little words made in japan were scaring the daylights out of america s auto and electronics industries , some american executives decided to find out what made japan tick a name they quickly came across w edwards deming in 1950 , mr deming was an unknown statistician with some odd ideas product quality is important , do it right the first time , do n't treat employees as adversaries the japanese , with nothing to lose and everything to rebuild , seized on his ideas and he became a national hero only much later did america catch on in 1981 ford asked him to stop by , and as word of his magic spread , more and more companies jumped on his bandwagon , making mr deming a busy man well into his 90 s , he traveled the country doing seminars last week mr deming died at 93 quality , one hopes , survives international speeding aid to russia within russia these days , economic reform is not a popular idea , but on the outside , attitudes are mixed the united states is backing away from a shock therapy approach , while the imf sees the need for making the idea of reform seem less onerous to russians to that end , imf officials said last week that they might loosen conditions for providing aid but they also urged boris yeltsin to cut subsidies to inefficient state industries and use that money to help the needy in april , industrial nations pledged 28 billion , but russia s gotten only about 10 billion do n't play it again , uncle sam imagine this orwellian scene while you search for places to put all those gifts , you tune in your favorite radio station and spend a pleasant hour listening to mozart , beethoven , a bit of verdi suddenly an official voice breaks in this station is unamerican and is being shut down it did not have the required 24 minutes of american music in the last hour farfetched \? perhaps but that , in essence , is what france is planning the world trade talks may have ended , but one dispute simmers on the european fear that the american entertainment colossus will undermine its culture last week , the french senate approved a law forcing radio stations to play at least 40 percent french music in other words , this one world tune is fine , as long as the lyrics are in french a scary ride at euro disney the french may also be on the verge of rejecting another icon of american culture , but with their wallets , not their laws the troubles at the euro disney theme park near paris have gotten so bad , its auditors said last week , that it may have to close there s been talk of financial rescues , of how long the walt disney company \( which owns 49 percent \) will keep pumping money in , of banks possibly taking stock instead of some debt but none of that has anything to do with the basic problem that a formula that s such a bonanza back home just is n't working in france in paris , in fact , euro disney s shares fell to about a fifth of their level before the park opened last year
washington , nov 22 the federal government s information on nutrients in food , used around the world to determine public nutrition policy , plan feeding programs , do medical research and answer questions like how much vitamin a is in a sweet potato or how much fat is in a sirloin steak , is flawed and unreliable , according to a federal report issued today for average people on diets who are counting calories or grams of fat , or for people on lowsodium diets , the inaccuracies reported by the general accounting office , the investigative arm of congress , could present a problem the gao said the nutrition information in the publication , handbook 8 , is inaccurate because of sloppy , inconsistent or questionable methods of collecting data although the extent of the problem is not yet clear , there are instances where fat and fiber estimates for certain foods in handbook 8 are considerably different from the data that other government agencies report on the same items for example , handbook 8 says there are 3 , 000 international units of vitamin a in a portion of papaya , while new methodology available elsewhere indicates there are only 400 units in the same portion flaws were suspected steps to reconcile all the inconsistencies would require vast sums for testing each individual food and are a long way off some nutritionists and researchers today expressed shock at the gao s assessment of handbook 8 , which gives the nutrient analysis of more than 5 , 000 foods others said they had suspected flaws for some time and had tried to compensate for it in their work marion nestle , head of the department of nutrition at new york university , expressed dismay over the report , because it puts the credibility of nutrition information on the front pages again every single dietary intake survey done in this country is based on handbook 8 , she said it is the basis of all food assistance programs one place that consumers come into contact with nutritional data like that in handbook 8 is on the labels of processed foods while handbook 8 is not used to compile such label information on most products , because large food companies perform their own analysis , in some cases it can be used smaller companies that cannot afford the costs of doing nutritional analyses themselves are allowed by the food and drug administration to rely on the handbook s figures in the report , requested by representative george e brown jr , democrat of california , chairman of the committee on science , space and technology , the accounting office criticizes the human nutrition information service of the department of agriculture for using lax methods in compiling the nutritional data the report says the agency often does not have enough samples and accepts data with little or no supporting information on the testing and quality assurance procedures used to develop the data for example , it says the nutrient data on baconcheeseburgers comes primarily from brochures provided by fast food chains , which do not explain how the data were determined indeed , much of the information in handbook 8 comes from the food industry , the report said support not required other government agencies , like the food and drug administration , also accept information from industry sources when making policy decisions but in the case of drugs , for instance , private companies' data must include extensive supporting evidence with food , the department of agriculture does not require the private companies to provide any of the underlying research we do n't know how bad the data are , said grace ostenso , staff director of the house panel , so we do n't know what the consequences are in response to the report , the human nutrition and information service acknowledged that its data could be better , but said it lacks money to do better only 200 , 000 is budgeted annually for nutrient analysis , while a single analysis costs 2 , 000 , the agency says the report confirms what we already believe , said ellen haas , the assistant secretary of agriculture in charge of the nutrition service there is a history of neglect and of lack of accountability in this agency the department can cite inaccurate information itself for instance , it says that 35 ounces of soft tofu have 5 grams of fat and that 35 ounces of hard tofu have 10 grams of fat but the center for science in the public interest , a washington public advocacy group , has found that soft tofu in the same amount has 3 grams of fat and hard tofu , 5 grams similarly , the department of agriculture says an orange has 31 grams of fiber , while the produce marketing association says it has 58 grams of fiber the association , which represents the industry , based its information on research it presented to the food and drug association for labeling purposes the fda considered its information accurate and accepted it 'longstanding concern' catherine wotecki , director of the food and nutrition board of the national academy of sciences , said she was not surprised at the accounting office s findings it has been a matter of longstanding concern in the research community , but in the absence of anything better we have to use it , she said no one has done anything to rectify it , she added , because it s an unsexy issue , dull and uninteresting even though it is the foundation of research some government agencies have tried to compensate for the data s unreliability in making public policy the food and drug administration s recent proposal to fortify grain products with folic acid to prevent certain birth defects took into account the unreliability of the handbook 8 data the amount of folic acid , a b vitamin , is generally underreported in handbook 8 because the method of calculating it has changed and the department has not adjusted its figures because of those and other uncertainties , the food and drug agency had to estimate the amount of folic acid in the american diet and build in a margin of safety so that fortification would not result in overdoses of the vitamin we have never used handbook 8 as the sole criteria , said dr elizabeth yetley , acting director of the office of special nutrition at the food and drug administration we always base public policy on additional sources dr f edward scarborough , director of the office of food labeling at the agency , said the fda was aware of and concerned about the reliability of the data , but there is no other game in town and we just ca n't throw it out and start from scratch the accounting office s report is not the first public criticism of the nutrient data in handbook 8 in 1989 an committee drawn from various agencies expressed concerns about the accuracy of the data , the analytical methods , the quality control and the documentation the group discussed five projects that needed to be undertaken to address the concerns four years later the projects have been started , but none has been completed
nashville , april 4 of all the gold medalists in the 1992 summer olympics at barcelona , spain , perhaps none led a wilder life than nelson diebel he talked freely of his overactive youth getting into fights , experimenting with drugs and alcohol , jumping out of windows on a dare , rebeling against authority and perhaps no gold medalist this side of michael jordan or magic johnson became more recognizable at barcelona than this freespirit swimmer with a shaved head covered by a red , white and blue bandana that is all history the wild man has become tame he has control of his personal life but not his swimming because his right shoulder is so worn down that he might never swim again camaraderie , not competition he came here for the united states swimming spring championships , which ended tonight the shoulder does not let him swim , but he wanted to be here to see swimming friends and keep his hand , if not his shoulder , in the water so he volunteered to help meet officials , and he is doing that as a press operations special assistant a what \? i'm a gofer , he said i love it the 22yearold princeton sophomore from oak brook , ill , had hoped to swim here , but he has not competed since the olympics between trials and finals saturday , he did swim an easy 300 meters afterward , he said , the shoulder was sore for two and a half years , the rotator cuff in the shoulder has swollen whenever he swims , and when he gets out of the water he cannot lift his right arm above the shoulder while doctors have told him nothing is really wrong , they have no immediate solution i started training in october , he said after four days , i was going to classes the next day wearing ice , trying to get the swelling down it would n't go down and it would n't go away , so i decided it was more important for me to wait i think i can lick this thing i 've been talking to doctors , including the one who fixed dan marino s shoulder so he could throw a football again i hope it will turn out to be a relatively simple program that can be solved in a relatively simple way i prefer no surgery , but if i have to do it to continue swimming , then i 'll do it for five years on the prep school and club teams at peddie , diebel s coach was chris martin seven months before the olympics , martin said , the shoulder was so bad that i did n't think he would make it in the grand scheme of things , i do n't think it matters if he swims again , it will be a long process if he does n't , he won a gold medal marge diebel said she had faith in her son when he has something difficult to do , she said , he does it extraordinarily well if it s mind over matter , if anybody can do it , he can but what if he does n't \? diebel said he could handle it i 've accomplished things in my swimming that anybody would be satisfied with , he said i'm not a greedy person i do n't need another gold medal i 'd just like to swim some more it s not a quest or an obligation , just something i 'd enjoy i would like to swim faster if i ca n't , i 've got a lot of things out of my experience as a swimmer , and i'm grateful for that i do appreciate it for what it is if i ca n't swim again , i 'll still have the people and the places in my life and mind that s what i 've got out of it i 'll still have the rest of life i 'll still remember how it felt i have a life i'm engaged i'm taking classes so i wo n't be adrift without purpose
pompano beach , fla mel levine s book tour will be cut short by a previous engagement nearly two years in prison for tax and bank fraud he s not going away for anything he did as a sports agent , but he is now claiming he coordinated a coverup of payments to three university of miami football players in 1986 only the naive believed him then only the stubborn disbelieve him now i found a loophole in the irs , levine said of his legal troubles , with only a trace of swagger left without a doubt , one thing led to the other you start to think you 're invincible loopholes that s what it s all about before he goes away to federal prison , levine has a cheery tale for the holiday season , when underpaid laborers attached to major universities will entertain us in bowl games just the other day , alabama lost the southeastern conference championship partly because florida flooded passes over the replacement for antonio langham , alabama s best defensive back , who had become ineligible because he signed with a sports agent you see how the ante has gone up since i was in it , mel levine said agents get 46 percent you do n't think antonio langham s the only one , do you \? actually , no , i do n't this is all depressingly grubby , and none of us would care , except for the collaboration of television networks and bowl games and major corporations and large universities to not pay salaries to football and basketball players the athletes respond the only logical way they cheat , with the help of agents like mel levine if we want to know how it works in 1993 , we need to learn how it worked in 1986 levine is offering us 140 pages of text , 52 pages of documents , in a book entitled life in the trash lane cash , cars and corruption a sports agent s true story , to be published at the end of the month by distinctive publishing of pompano beach a lawyer and accountant , levine was drawn to the glitter after he moved from bayside , queens he worked for professional players , but then younger people delivered college players to him soon , he said , he turned over a used silver corvette to cleveland gary he arranged for a new black corvette to go to jerome brown then gary got mad and demanded a new corvette then alonzo highsmith settled for a toyota supra levine even wrote up a contract that specified the contract itself was against the rules of the national collegiate athletic association he exhibits a dry sense of wit when he writes that the commitment was only as good as the man making it oddly enough , these flashy cars in the hands of college athletes attracted the attention of the university and the ncaa in chapter 3 of his book , levine claims he coordinated the players , their relatives and some of his helpers to convince investigators that it was all a big mistake , he was really in the carleasing business , the parents made all the payments , plus , he just liked to do favors for people you make up stories and everybody buys them , levine said the other day you think , 'i can get away with everything' one drawback was that levine could not very well turn up as the agent for these players when they turned professional he said he lost 82 , 000 in real money he had advanced them that they never paid back brown has since died in the crash of a sports car gary is with the los angeles rams and highsmith , in a sincere attempt to boost circulation , has told conflicting stories to florida newspapers , with his general tone being that the system is rotten and athletes should exploit it for all it s worth and it s hard to not agree with him levine said he got out of the agent business after florida passed a law in 1988 making it a felony to give money to athletes with college eligibility remaining he said he was overextended in other businesses , and tried to cheat the irs he said he wrote the book mostly for money , partially for a bit of soulcleansing he has made a good first step by verbalizing i am a criminal and he does not deny that the book is a form of vengeance toward the athletes these kids come to your door , their hands are out , levine said they said if i did n't give them money , they could get it from other agents levine laughs at the concept of a minimal wage for all bigtime players they 'd say 'that s just a stipend where s the real money \? ' and he s right until bigtime college sports are allowed to float into the open market , there will still be players with empty hands out and agents with money to give them and universities that cannot afford to know
in the days leading up to christmas eve each year , the rev john flynn , the pastor of st martin of tours roman catholic church in the bronx , gets a few calls asking when midnight mass begins it is not a trick question i tell them , 8 o'clock , he said parishioners decided it was too risky to walk through the streets of crotona at such a late hour and wanted the service moved up in a compromise between faith and fear the culture of violence has changed a lot of things , father flynn said , adding , maybe some day that stuff will work again maybe some day we 'll go back to when the front door was always unlocked , too something special is lost in marking the night when , according to the gospel of st luke , an angel appeared to startled shepherds and told them to fear not , because a saviour was born , churchgoers in some of the city s tougher neighborhoods fear much officials of the catholic and episcopal churches , in which midnight services have been particularly popular , say they do not know how many parishes have moved up the starting time for such services or eliminated them nor do the police keep crime statistics on how christmas eve compares with other nights but the rev patricia reeberg , a baptist minister who is executive director of the new york council of churches , echoed the impressions of others when she said she thought the number of such services was decreasing steadily , taking with them a bit of the season s special nature the air of expectancy , the night before we celebrate the birth of our messiah , is a special experience that i miss , she said the midnight mass is part of the culture of spiritual impact she added that the aging of church populations , as well as parties and christmas eve sales , had contributed to a shift in emphasis away from the midnight marvel of hymns , candlelight and worship but in the midst of fear and urban danger , some congregations have stood firm , continuing the midnight tradition in a gesture of faith and hope you grow up with it and want to pass it on , said the rev gerald ryn , pastor of st luke s roman catholic church in mott haven in the bronx that it should be at night is something that faith looks for the roots of such services date from the late fourth and early fifth centuries , said the rev william belford , the chairman of the liturgical commission of the archdiocese of new york he said christian writers of that era described midnight masses during the christmas season , including one celebrated by pope sixtus iii in rome in 435 he said the link to the hour reflected the holiday s scriptural roots in the gospel of st luke , which describe the events of that night it spoke of darkness , so it was a very appropriate connection , he said people felt they were living that moment again the timing also made it the earliest possible service to mark the day as seasonal as the snow folks in religion like to have something dramatic , said father flynn of st martin of tours , which has not had a real midnight mass in more than a decade if you do it at midnight and give god this special time when you stayed up late and did n't open your packages until you took care of god , it was a nice way to begin the day , with the absolutely first moment of that day for many people , midnight services have always been as much part of the season as snow on christmas day thousands still crowd st patrick s cathedral and the cathedral of st john the divine , which distribute free tickets in advance as a way to control the crowds dorothy simmons , a parishioner at st martin s for the last decade , said she still preferred midnight mass , although she could not recall the last time she attended one i felt a closer connection to the birth , she said at 8 o'clock , it s not quite as solemn or the closeness that existed when it was at 12 age and ill health but parishioners said the decision to change the mass to an earlier time was made after attendance began declining because people were afraid to go outside it s sad , but unless you have a cop walking with you and a sherman tank , it s not safe , said wardean squireaskew , a parishioner at st martin s for the last five years the growing proportion of elderly congregants has also caused some parishes to move up services ill health prevents some from being able to stay up late , while others are reluctant to walk to church without younger people to escort them that is one reason why services at st mary s episcopal church in harlem have been moved up to 7 o'clock i'm sure with the older members , there is a prevailing concern for one s safety and coming back at 1 in the morning and getting on an elevator to the 20th floor and being alone , said the rev robert castle , the priest in charge people are concerned for their wellbeing and you never know when you 're going to run into someone high on drugs some harlem churches , father castle noted , have primarily commuter congregations , consisting of people who have long since moved from the neighborhood in those parishes , the earlier service is scheduled more out of convenience some priests whose churches have moved up the service said the earlier time had its advantages , with parents being able to attend with young children and priests being able to get a decent night s sleep before celebrating more masses on christmas day benefit in quality time msgr john powis , the pastor of st barbara s roman catholic church in bushwick , brooklyn , said that having a 9 pm service had added benefits for his parishioners you get out at 11 and have quality time with your family , he said it s an interesting change there will be a special emphasis on the family this year at st mary s in harlem , when father castle baptizes several children as part of the service it seems like a fitting day , he said we welcome the christ child into the world and baptism is a way of welcoming a new child into the christian community some have even tried to find meaning in the violence and fear that have caused them to have early services the rev stephen marsh , the pastor of the lutheran church of the holy redeemer in east new york , called it a reminder of the social conditions that form and test faith the christ child came into the midst of the world , no matter how messed up it was , he said it helps to remind me that we 're dealing with the world when we sit on christmas eve and hear gunfire it helps you remember that this stuff is n't in a vacuum refusal to be prisoner even in east new york , where the murder rate this year worked out to a killing every third day , the rev john peyton refuses to be a prisoner to the negativeness of the streets that ring st rita s roman catholic church , which still has midnight mass at midnight he does encourage people to travel in groups , and patrols are set up outside the church to watch over cars but he said that in the 11 years he had conducted such services at his church , none of his parishioners had been victimized on the way home it s a symbolic gesture that if nothing else , we will not be moved , he said it s not allowing the evil to try and take over we as a church must come together and organize for good that is what christmas is about christ coming into our midst and saving us photo because of safety concerns and a growing proportion of elderly congregants , st mary s episcopal church in harlem has moved its midnight mass up to 7 pm i'm sure with the older members , there is a prevailing concern for one s safety and coming back at 1 in the morning and getting on an elevator to the 20th floor and being alone , said the rev robert castle , the priest in charge \( monica almeida the new york times \)
cambridge , mass a new massachusetts institute of technology study shows that president clinton can save hundreds of billions of dollars by reducing the pentagon budget without sacrificing the strength of our military forces helped by a colleague , philip morrison , we have found how to save 681 billion \( in current dollars \) through the year 2000 32 billion in 1993 alone that is 21 billion more than the cuts suggested by defense secretary les aspin the 21 billion is the equivalent of 40 million families each paying 525 less in taxes next year since money spent on the defense industry can employ twice as many people in civilian jobs , the cuts we propose would not create net unemployment so long as half the amount saved was spent on civilian projects sixty percent of our military expenses during the cold war went to defend the us and its allies against the soviet threat this threat evaporated by 1992 , yet the pentagon plans to spend only 17 percent less in 1997 than it spent in 1992 the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff , gen colin l powell , invoking the need for strategic depth , insists america can cut only 2 to 4 percent of military costs a year through 1998 in order to retain certain capabilities to protect our interests around the world this vague pronouncement does not justify the size of the military the pentagon wants we recommend cutting the budget about 7 percent a year the same rate it was reduced for a few years after the korean and vietnam wars during the cuban missile crisis , america had five aircraft carrier task forces now we have 14 , each costing 3 billion a year to operate we need no more than five two can be decommissioned this year , at a 6 billion net savings at once the army maintains 12 active divisions , the marines two in operation desert storm , not quite eight were used now that europe is not threatened , in this fiscal year we can retire one division in europe and one in america , saving 6 billion the air force has 95 strategic b1 bombers and 175 b52 s and is procuring 20 additional b2 s at more than 1 billion each none of these planes is needed for nuclear deterrence we should mothball the 81 older b52 s and half the b1 s this year , saving 5 billion we should stop procuring the notso stealthy b2 bomber and the c17 , the flawed new transport plane we do n't need these aircraft because others can perform their functions total net savings 73 billion stop procuring the one new sea wolf submarine and the four new ddg51 destroyers , saving 4 billion this year , buy half the planned 20 f18 fighters and 30 trident2 missiles for the navy , saving 15 billion cancel the contract for 60 redundant army blackhawk helicopters , and reduce by 10 percent the army s purchase of ammunition and electronics , saving 1 billion curtail the unworkable strategic defense initiative and save 2 billion overall savings from these cutbacks would come to nearly 40 billion , but 8 billion would have to be spent for terminating contracts and mothballing planes and ships the net savings would be 32 billion in 1993 by the year 2000 , the budget can be reduced to 164 billion a year , for a total savings of 681 billion between now and then last month , the congressional budget office , in its publication reducing the deficit spending and revenue options , identified 61 cuts in the defense budget totaling 308 billion for 1994 through 1998 we suggest 346 billion for that period president clinton can safely order cuts in defense spending , based not on nebulous strategic pronouncements but on a reasonable assessment , to use defense community jargon , of how much is enough drawing
pensacola , fla , march 13 david gunn never set out to be a symbol he wanted to deliver babies but then an abortion clinic asked for help , and because no other doctor would do the job , performing abortions in the rural south became dr gunn s life there were wanted posters with his name on them , people following him late at night , hate mail , death threats , protesters yelling murderer ! dr gunn kept three guns in his car one in the glove compartment , one under the seat and one in the trunk michael f griffin , who grew up in this conservative , military base city , is a fundamentalist christian and a loner with a bad temper dr gunn was shot fatally three times in the back last wednesday in the parking lot of a clinic where he worked here , and mr griffin told the police that he pulled the trigger two months ago , mr griffin showed up on the fringe of an extreme antiabortion group here led by a lay minister named john burt mr burt , a former member of the ku klux klan , has taken pains to distance himself from mr griffin he did not know much about the newcomer to his group , he said i'm like the general who sends out the orders to the troops , mr burt said friday i ca n't control it if one goes bad i ca n't be responsible 'two speeding trains' the lives of david gunn and michael griffin reflect much about the bitter divisions over abortion , revealing people on both sides those who are willing to take enormous personal risks to insure a woman s right to choice , and those who are willing to go to extremes to prevent abortion it was like two speeding trains coming from opposite directions , said susan hill , the executive director of the women s health network , which operates a clinic in columbus , ga , one of six clinics where dr gunn worked it could have happened in columbus , or fargo , north dakota , or fort wayne , indiana it could have been any clinic or any doctor but the percentages were higher that it was going to be david because he probably worked at more clinics than anyone else the 47yearold dr gunn did not look like a standardbearer he was a little skinny guy , said don gratton , a lay minister who is a member of mr burk s antiabortion group and the doctor , who worked in blue jeans and nikes , had a severe limp , the result of a childhood bout with polio doctors told him he would never walk without a leg brace , or drive a car , but he did both polio helped lead him to medicine his granddaddy told him , 'you know what it s like to be sick , you can take care of people , ' said his older brother , peter gunn , an insurance agent in benton , ky , where dr gunn grew up his limp was part of the reason he chose obstetrics it was something we discussed , peter gunn said you delivered babies in a seated position he could n't stand for hours and hours without getting tired after graduating from medical school at the university of kentucky and completing his residency at vanderbilt university in nashville , dr gunn began his work at a public hospital in brewton , ala he told me he came to alabama because it had the highest infantmortality rate in the nation , and he wanted to try to turn that around , said his son , david gunn jr , 22 ten years ago , dr gunn set up a practice with a fertility specialist in eufaula , ala , an old river port known for its bass fishing around the same time , the elderly doctor who had been performing abortions at ms hill s clinic in columbus , three hours away , got too sick to work we called every doctor in every town from columbus to atlanta , ms hill said they would not answer our calls , or they would hang up on us , or they would tell us they were scared finally , they approached dr gunn he knew how to do abortions , ms hill said he was a laidback 60 s kind of guy who did n't like the politics of medicine he wanted to help he started out doing abortions once a week , but before long he was making the circuit of six clinics , driving 1 , 000 miles a week a clinic would call , and he 'd say he would help out until they found someone else , ms hill said but no other doctor would do the work , and so david was there forever he eventually gave up his private practice and spent most of his time on the road , living out of hotels what little free time he had he spent with his children from his first marriage , david , a junior at the university of alabama in birmingham , and wendy , 17 , who lives in the same city religious upbringing dr gunn was raised in a family whose devout church of christ religion forbids abortion peter gunn said that neither he , nor his parents , nor anyone else in the family had known that david performed abortions they found out when they watched the news of the killing on television david gunn was a young man when he left the church he was committed to a woman s freedom to choose and he had seen too many cases of abuse and neglect , and too many unwanted babies , to believe that every pregnancy should be brought to term it was something he discussed with paula leonard , a nurse at one of the two clinics in pensacola where he worked dr gunn , who was divorced , was separated from his second wife , and had been seeing ms leonard for about a year
trenton , feb 26 joe constance and his trenton police department homicide detectives were still struggling to put together the details of the murder of kristin huggins when television pictures flashed from liverpool , england , showing a crowd attacking a police van carrying two young boys accused of killing a 2yearold i would love to see the kind of anger that those people in england expressed , said mr constance , who is deputy chief for criminal investigations i want to see the idea that it s obscene to kill someone , where you go crazy when it happens those people were stoning the police van why are n't we like that anymore \? deputy chief constance is investigating a case where the public response has not been information and encouragement , but rather silence , evasiveness , sour racial animosity and a business as usual , just another senseless death attitude the police say that on the day miss huggins was abducted , dec 17 , at least one witness pulled over and waited to let the suspect , ambrose harris , pull out from the parking lot of the private trenton club as miss huggins , 22 , wept hysterically in the passenger seat of his car witnesses let him go two men , including the manager of the club , saw the accused man return to the scene later , after miss huggins had been stuffed , still alive , in the trunk of the car they asked him what he was doing on private property and , they told the police , mr harris said he had gone there to recover his bicycle they let him go while mr harris was recovering his bicycle and talking with the employees at the back of the club , a woman carrying a baby was drawn across the street to the front , by the sounds of miss huggins screaming and banging on the lid of the trunk , mr constance said the woman left after peering at the car and at someone , now accused as an accomplice , who was waiting nervously in it none of those witnesses came forward after miss huggins was reported missing that night , when she failed to return from the trenton club , an oldline club that has long attracted the city s business elite miss huggins , who graduated from temple university school of art two years ago , had been commissioned to paint a mural there nor did the manager of a public housing project call the police when , a few days later , a tenant tried to give him the victim s video rental card , plainly bearing her name not until those now accused in the slaying stumbled into police hands could detectives place the witnesses at the scene even after interviewing several of them not one volunteered here we have a cruel , senseless , horrible homicide , and we 're desperate for information , mr constance said as he reconstructed events we located 30 , 40 witnesses , but not one of them came forward voluntarily we had to locate every one of them one of them even refused to identify harris when we showed him a picture and i'm not talking about junkies and prostitutes and street people who never talk to us , i'm talking about upstanding citizens , including a quasiofficial employee of the city the police found the body of miss huggins , who had been shot twice through the head , under a thin covering of dirt in a vacant industrial section of trenton on feb 18 the police were led to it by the sister of the woman charged as an accomplice the sister , who had been posing as a psychic in the hope of gaining a reward , led the police to miss huggins s grave when challenged about her knowledge , she confessed that her sister had given her the location and identified the two murder suspects the crime has absorbed trenton and its suburbs as miss huggins s parents and her friends in the new hope , pa , arts community circulated leaflets and put up posters seeking information but despite its elements of carjacking and murder , the story has not rippled far beyond the city two nationally syndicated magazineformat television programs approached mr constance about appearing on camera , but he turned them down all they were interested in is the gore , he said advice from an old cop mr constance is 48 years old and has 24 years on the force , and he knows that his outrage may sound overblown , or worse yet , banal look , i know , you 're talking to a tired old cop , he said but if we do n't change , it s going to be where we 're stepping over bodies or we 'll have martial law nor does he accept the argument he heard from some trentonians that the police only kept after the case because miss huggins was a white woman murdered in a mostly black city we go after every murder just as hard as this one , he said we have the record to prove it awaiting trial in 5 rapes mr harris , the 40yearold murder suspect , was released last july from the maximumsecurity wing in east jersey state prison in rahway after serving nine years for robbery on dec 26 , he was arrested in a trenton bar on charges of committing five rapes since his release , and was awaiting trial when he was charged with the huggins murder he is also a suspect in two other unsolved trenton murders , mr constance said the police said mr harris rode his bicycle to the club and wanted the car to commit a robbery gloria dunn , his 30yearold alleged accomplice , told the police that the accused man killed miss huggins because she was making too much noise in the trunk he said , according to miss dunn s statement i'm going to have to pop her the bitch is making too much noise do you want to watch \? from miss dunn s statement , the police also learned of the approach of the woman with the baby to the car where miss huggins was imprisoned that woman has not come forward mr harris and miss dunn were arraigned feb 22 on multiple murder and abduction charges , and neither could make bail 750 , 000 for mr harris and 200 , 000 for miss dunn on thursday , miss huggins was buried in morrisville , pa , in a ceremony attended by 600 mourners , many of whom had not known her the turnout , along with the formation of a group to circulate petitions asking for the death penalty in the case , has given deputy chief constance a lift it s a good sign that the people care enough to be angry , he said we 've got to do something , or it s going to be everyone locked up in their houses and the lions in the streets photo joe constance , deputy chief for criminal investigations of the trenton police department , is investigating a case where the public response has not been information and encouragement , but silence we located 30 , 40 witnesses , but not one of them came forward voluntarily , he said \( william e sauro the new york times \)
to the editor carol tavris s essay was merely the latest wave of the backlash attempting to deny the emerging truth about the abuse that is inflicted on children in our society there is indeed the dramatic polarization ms tavris describes , and her essay places her directly on the side of those who provide support for molesters , rapists , pedophiles and other misogynists , a side one certainly should apologize for choosing when people like ms tavris are frightened by the number of women who are described by checklists such as mine , their solution is to attempt to kill the messengers , professionally speaking , by impugning their methods or motives despite ms tavris s assertion that secret survivors presents groundless theories , unsupported by research , my conclusions are compiled from extensive interviews with survivors and from field observation , and are supported by many studies it is ms tavris s argument that false memories of child abuse can be created by overzealous therapists that is groundless there is no evidence that anyone who was not sexually abused can be persuaded otherwise , let alone made to suffer postincest syndrome how do i know that the majority of my clients are incest survivors , even when they almost never identify incest as their reason for seeking help \? the terror and despair and selfhate and death wish that they struggle with on a daily basis tell me that something real , something horrible , was done to them their belief that sex is what you must pay back for love , the fact that all sex may feel like rape , indicate that the trauma was of a sexual nature their inability to trust or bond , their deep sense of loss , their belief that they are entitled to nothing in life tell me that the trauma was at the hands of someone with whom they had a dependency bond if there was no abuse , why does a client gag every time she swallows \? why does she wake up in the middle of the night screaming \? why does she see her father s face and penis every time she tries to have sex \? why did she not get better with all the previous interventions , and why is she getting better now \? e sue blume freeport , li carol tavris replies of course i expected anger i also expected misreadings of what i said accusations that i am denying the reality of abuse , that i am contributing to the backlash against women s rights and so forth my hope is that when the anger has passed , we will be able to address the real problems that plague us child neglect and battering , incest , the appalling pervasiveness of violence against women i fear that the current sad and destructive impulse to see abuse in every home , and to manufacture memories where none existed , is creating a dangerous new set of problems to raise this concern does not make me antifeminist , any more than criticizing some policies of my government makes me antiamerican i apologize if i implied a dichotomy between phd researchers and mental health practitioners who hold other degrees skepticism , scholarship and therapeutic skill do not fall on only one side of the credential line i know that many feminists have been reluctant to question the excesses of the recovery movement because they do not want to support society s custom of disbelieving what women say i share this concern , because i know what a struggle it has been to get physicians , lawyers , police officers and politicians to listen to women and to hear them \( in this respect , though , we might ask why so many therapists do n't believe the mothers who tell a different story about their daughters' therapeutically induced memories \) but women are not helped , nor is feminism advanced , by the mindless acceptance of any doctrine that oversimplifies a complex issue if we wish to improve the health and status of women , we need to understand not only how women are helped by the recovery movement , but also how some are harmed should n't we worry if the movement is , however unintentionally , contributing to a national mood of sexual hysteria , parents' fears of hugging and kissing their children \( let alone of walking around naked in the house \) and cruel condemnations of nonabusive parents who merely made normal mistakes \? the abusesurvivor movement relies on formulas this symptom means that cause all abuse , from unwanted fondling to repeated rape , does produce the same results i refer interested readers to the january 1993 issue of the scholarly journal psychological bulletin in their paper impact of sexual abuse on children a review and synthesis of recent empirical studies , kathleen a kendalltackett , linda meyer williams and david finkelhor conclude no one symptom characterized a majority of sexually abused children the findings suggest the absence of any specific syndrome in children who have been sexually abused and no single traumatizing process that s the point
port rowan , ontario the sandy peninsula of long point , with its marshes , dunes , grasslands and beaches , stretches 25 miles into lake erie from just south of this village it is the habitat of 691 species of plants , 42 of which are rare in ontario , and a major feeding and regrouping area for thousands of migrating birds the longest freshwater sand spit in the world , long point owes its existence to the currents that sweep against the north shore of lake erie and carry hundreds of thousands of cubic yards of sand and fine gravel to the reef each year the shallow inner bay is a natural hatchery for millions of fish mainly perch , carp , yellow pickerel , whitefish , various species of bass and coho salmon and frogs and turtles now this fragile ecosystem has become one of canada s greatest environmental battlegrounds , with proposals to build marinas , breakwaters , condominiums , trailer parks , a motel , a country inn and a restaurant along the port rowan shoreline just opposite the long point wetlands neighbor against neighbor the struggle is of a kind familiar in the united states , where proponents of jobs and spotted owls have long been at each other s throats , but is less common in canada , an even vaster land with onetenth of the population of the united states the pressures of development are less intense in canada and sensitivity to the environment is generally acute the conflict in port rowan is visceral , pitting neighbor against neighbor in a picturesque community of 760 permanent residents while physical clashes have been avoided , there has been plenty of verbal abuse in council meetings , on the street and in the letters columns of the port rowan good news , the monthly newspaper the target of most of the attacks is the coalition advocating responsible development , or card , a group of about 60 largely retired professionals that has opposed just about every major shoreline development proposal since its founding four years ago the coalition was organized to redress what its president , michael maloney , 57 , a former reporter for the windsor star , calls the bias of municipal authorities in favor of developers the local council made exceptions every time a developer came forward , without determining whether the ecosystem could absorb it , he said unesco asks preservation arthur n langford , for four decades a professor of biology at bishop s university in lennoxville , quebec , who is secretary of the long point biosphere reserve , said this bloody council has no thoughts about the environment its only thoughts are of the assessment dollar the long point biosphere reserve is one of 276 sites around the world designated for preservation as unique and valuable by the united nations educational , scientific and cultural organization but the agency has no say in port rowan development the local government has welcomed developers to the village , which has been hit by a decline in tobacco , formerly the economic mainstay , and the closing of two lumberyards and a tomato canning plant with people smoking less , many tobacco farms have been shut down , reducing job opportunities and income to local businesses keith overbaugh , 57 , a local businessman , argued that developers were needed to create jobs for young people and attract tourists and that the environmental group represented a fanatical element opposed to almost any new project they expect everyone else to live by rules they make up , said mr overbaugh , who owns a paint and decorating shop , the painter s helper , and who represents the seventh generation of his family in the port rowan region these guys did n't invent the environment we certainly intend to protect it this is our home too 'must have development' an insideroutsider aspect to the dispute has magnified the bitterness many of the people fighting development lived and worked outside the area before coming to port rowan to retire they tend to be better off than the longtime residents judy shepherd , 47 , owner of a gift shop known as flying goose gifts and the fourth generation of her family in the region , said coming from a farm family , i am extremely conscious of the need to protect the environment but we must have development if we 're going to survive john aker , 31 , who inherited his father s apple orchard on a valuable piece of shoreline , has finally obtained the goahead to expand his marina and trailer park he said card ran me out of money pointing to land that also attracts mallards , geese and thousands of songbirds , he said , i 've got close to 200 , 000 in this approval of development projects involves a municipal and regional process the federal government plays no role the provincial government enters only as arbiter of last resort through a quasijudicial body known as the ontario municipal board as yet none of the shore development projects are under way 'the wrong area' through its precisely argued documents and legal actions , the coalition advocating responsible development has been able to tie up developments and , more important , the money invested by developers until environmental safeguards are firmly guaranteed the coalition has insisted , for example , on the retention of a 150foot zone of undeveloped land along the marshy shoreline as the condition for going along with one project , a luxury country inn and housing complex it has tied up a larger project of condominiums , motel , restaurant , breakwater and marina at the mouth of long point creek until a provincial shorelines policy is in place , arguing that this development endangers the basic geological processes that created this ecological jewel this is entirely the wrong area for the location of this type of facility , said one of the coalition advisers , prof robin davidsonarnott , a shorelines expert at the university of guelph jim harlow , 72 , a retired civil engineer , who is vice president of the coalition , pointed to the cumulative effects of developmental changes the problem is man s short life span he said if we lived to be 600 years old , everyone would be an environmentalist photo plans for recreational development near the long point wetlands in port rowan , ontario , have divided many of its residents arthur n langford , an opponent of the development , said of the local council it has no thoughts about the environment its only thoughts are of the assessment dollar \( elisavietta ritchie for the new york times \) map of ontario , canada

malibu , calif , nov 3 one of the largest firefighting efforts ever undertaken in california succeeded early today in saving thickly populated areas of los angeles from a stubborn wildfire , but not before more than 200 homes and 35 , 000 acres were destroyed in the wealthy beachside enclave of malibu and nearby canyons all night , fires of suspicious origin raged out of control until the santa ana winds from the desert abated this morning as winds changed , black and orange banks of smoke parted a bit , revealing a scene of terrible desolation to those in a helicopter above vast tracts of rutted hills were blackened , sprinkled with white ash and littered with the forlorn ruins of once magnificent homes but the fire was a capricious enemy just across the pacific coast highway , which separates the beach from the hills , all but a handful of the costly beachfront homes emerged untouched completely intact was the malibu colony , a private enclave on the water where many movie stars keep homes a lagoon and open fields apparently stayed the fire flames towering 60 feet or more continued to flare today in the upper , less populated reaches of topanga , tuna and corral canyons to the north of malibu and in the fernwood area west of los angeles this afternoon , 100 homes in imminent danger were evacuated on fernwood pacific drive near topanga canyon boulevard county fire officials said it would take another three days to contain the remaining fires flames approach los angeles but a force of 5 , 000 firefighters , 765 engine companies and 6 air tankers achieved the top priority of preventing the flames from crossing the rubicon of topanga canyon and spreading east into the more populous los angeles neighborhoods of palisades highlands , pacific palisades and castellammare and toward the j paul getty museum , near the ocean just outside the city limits this afternoon , however , a leading edge of fire managed to jump onto the east wall of topanga canyon , bringing it less than two miles from palisades highlands exhausted fire crews worked all night to hold the line along topanga canyon , just east of malibu , aided by helicopters dropping fire retardants and 3 , 000gallon buckets of water scooped from the ocean the worst is over , proclaimed chief donald manning of the los angeles fire department just after dawn this morning he credited a good break in the weather 125 hurt in firefight fast , hot desert winds that whipped across the area for 24 hours finally abated this morning in the face of new ocean breezes the weather forecast called for mild winds today and tomorrow , but fire crews remained uneasy about the notoriously fickle santa anas that come every fall the day s actions capped an exhausting , nerveracking week of firestorms in southern california that have blackened about 200 , 000 acres in six counties and destroyed more than 700 homes , not counting the malibu destruction one fatality has been reported so far duncan gibbins , a british film maker who was severely burned while trying to rescue a cat from the malibu fire , died tonight he was 41 another man was critically burned , and 125 firefighters were injured in the last 24 hours , none severely while not calling the fire arson , los angeles county sheriff s investigators were investigating reports of suspicious people seen near the point of origin of the fire on old topanga canyon road near calabasas driven by northeast wind , the flames spread down from there through funnellike canyons to malibu and the ocean after touring the area this morning , an angry gov pete wilson said there was evidence of arson and announced a 125 , 000 reward for the arrest of suspects the money was offered by the state , five insurance companies and the william rowland foundation in a television address from washington tonight , president clinton called the fires a terrifying experience and promised a strong federal response to help , including an immediate 15 million for firefighting costs , the associated press reported there were also new calls for tougher regulations on urban development in remote fireprone hills and canyons in the arid west in an interview today on the abc program good morning america , interior secretary bruce babbitt said , we 're going to have to really do some soulsearching about the process of building into these deep canyons with all the brush and starting examining zoning ordinances and federal policies , look at whether or not we should do more prescribed burning , whether there ought to be more setback requirements , whether there ought to be stronger laws requiring brush clearance as a condition of building up in these canyons several factors made the fires of the last week even more probable than normal six years of drought that left much dead vegetation in inaccessible canyons , a rainy spring that added a thick new underbrush , a long , dry summer and then the dry santa ana winds all the fires were ignited by arson , accident or downed power lines an hour aboard a helicopter offered an eerie and sometimes terrifying glimpse into the devastation a blanket of orangebrown smoke hovered over the pacific coast highway , which is jammed with commuters most mornings but was almost deserted today , except for police and fire vehicles an occasional swimmer or surfer bounced in the waves , as if nothing was amiss

aliquippa , pa molten metal still flows in a handful of buildings on the sevenmile stretch of the ohio river bank here where a sprawling jones laughlin steel complex once employed as many as 17 , 000 workers but if the nation had a hospital for communities , this struggling town 25 miles northwest of pittsburgh would have been sent to intensive care the ltv corporation , which bought jones laughlin in 1968 , has only 600 employees here now they work in a tin mill that coats steel made elsewhere farther north , in a former ltv building , a machine maintenance and repair concern shares space with a small steel finishing company then there is j l structural inc , a private concern that in 1987 acquired an ltv mill that makes 14inch steel bars used primarily in mobile home construction , and a dock facility for shipping and receiving goods by water it employs about 130 people added up , though , the activity is a meager down payment on future prosperity of a town that was built by paternalistic steel barons earlier this century and has been dependent on the industry ever since most of the steelmaking operations have been carefully demolished what remains are vast stretches of vacant , bulldozed land ringed by barbedwire fences and no trespassing signs the aliquippa experience is a stark contrast to that of kamaishi , japan , a steel town that lost its leading industry when the nippon steel corporation gradually shut its steelmaking operations there eager to preserve its lifetimeemployment policy , nippon created almost any new business it could for the jobless workers aliquippa is only one of many american towns that were blasted by the contraction of the steel industry there are about 167 , 000 workers in the industry today , down from a peak of 650 , 000 in 1953 many communities that depend on auto makers and military contractors have faced similar pressures a few communities are equally dependent on military bases that are scheduled to close in the coming decade occasionally , american companies that have left the communities they dominated economically have been willing and able to provide substantial transition assistance more typically , though , the abandoned communities and various government bodies have been left to do the best they can with limited corporate support hardpressed steelmakers in particular have had little to offer towns like aliquippa when they pulled out indeed , some like ltv have ended up in bankruptcy court where they sought to duck pension obligations and other support that workers had assumed would be theirs even in the event of shutdowns it s not just ltv , although once jones laughlin sold to them we became nothing more than a blip on a texas computer , said sylvester greco , a longtime downtown merchant , referring to ltv s corporate headquarters in dallas there was so many things that went wrong that i do n't know where to begin franklin avenue , the main shopping street of the town during its heyday in the 1950 s and 1960 s , looks even more forlorn than the weedpocked expanses where openhearth furnaces once flamed about 30 stores , including mr greco s cheerful shop that sells bridal and women s clothing , survive in a shopping district that once had almost 300 most storefronts are boarded up , empty or given over to social service agencies there are gaps where entire buildings have been torn down but not replaced the woes of downtown aliquippa are not entirely the fault of its shrinking steel industry it has also been victimized by a migration to the suburbs of wageearning families and the merchants who serve them the population fell by 20 percent during the 1970 s even though employment at the mill held relatively steady at more than 10 , 000 aliquippa has been ghettoized , said simon simoni , a lawyer here for 35 years all that s left around here are the aged and those on welfare many steelworkers retired to live on parttime handyman work and pensions after the layoffs union officials said that others had found jobs as baggage handlers and bus drivers at pittsburgh s airport , as security guards at shopping malls , and in a variety of other service tasks that pay far less than the mill surviving on lower wages donald maretti , who was laid off in 1984 after 19 1 2 years , just six months short of his pension , had a series of jobs that advanced him to the position of director of housekeeping at the beaver valley mall about a 15minute drive north of aliquippa i could have done anything when i came out of the marines , mr maretti said i chose the mill i do n't blame the government , the company or the union for what happened few of the workers have landed jobs that pay as well as the mill once did the pension plan is relatively liberal and helps a lot of people survive on lower wages , said peter eritano , the staff representative of the united steelworkers international for western pennsylvania and the former head of the aliquippa local a patchwork of training programs and social services provided by ltv , the union , churches and government agencies also cushioned the crash federally financed education benefits for workers who

while some concerned parents kept their children out of school yesterday , new york city health officials moved quickly to reassure them that there have been no further cases of meningitis reported after the death last week of a 6yearold boy from washington heights at a meeting at public school 132 yesterday , more than 400 anxious parents were told not to panic but to remain vigilant city health department officials said the main period of concern for spread of the disease was over and they did not recommend preventive actions for anyone beyond the immediate family of the child when the boy , andres maldonado , left the school on wadsworth avenue between 182d and 183d street on jan 20 , he showed none of the symptoms of meningitis fever , headache , vomiting , stiff neck and rash said erick manuel irizarry , principal of ps 132 the boy s parents , andres and glenda maldonado of west 179th street , said later that they thought he had come down with the flu , but by friday he appeared to be in a coma and was taken by ambulance to columbiapresbyterian medical center , where he was pronounced dead bacterial infection on monday , officials at ps 132 learned that the first grader had died of meningococcal meningitis , a severe bacterial infection of the bloodstream and the lining of the brain and spinal cord addressing a letter in english and spanish to all parents , mr irizarry said there was no reason for alarm but should a child develop symptoms of meningitis , they should contact a physician in subsequent meetings at the school , health department officials explained to parents and school personnel that meningitis was a communicable disease , spread through respiratory contact with an infected person only people in close contact with someone infected , like household members , should seek preventive treatment , and certain antibiotics like penicillin are very effective in treating meningitis ten out of 30 children in the maldonado boy s class have stayed away from school and absenteeism is somewhat higher this week than the usual 8 or 9 percent in the rest of the 1 , 600student body , mr irizarry said he said that many parents have taken their children to see doctors but that there has been no mass movement to keep children at home we have called the homes of all those who are absent , and the children are fine , the principal said he added that to our knowledge there was no truth to a rumor that another boy in the class had come down with the disease a spokesman for the city health department , peter lynn , said that no further cases of meningitis had been reported and that the main window of concern has passed he said symptoms could appear two to 10 days after exposure but in the majority of cases within three or four days this is the third case of meningitis in new york city this year , and the other two cases did not occur in washington heights , mr lynn said there were 27 cases last year and 30 in 1991 , but mr lynn could not say how many were fatal vicki zeldin , a spokeswoman for the state health department , put the yearly average statewide at 250 mostly isolated cases , with a death rate of under 10 percent she noted that after an outbreak of nine cases last fall in jefferson county , near the canadian border , 43 , 000 people aged 2 to 29 were vaccinated and there has been only one case there since of a child who was not vaccinated we 're pretty close to ending this period of anxiety , mr irizarry said , noting that it had been eight days since the maldonado boy was in school he said this was the first case of meningitis in his seven and a half years as principal of ps 132 after yesterday s forum with health department staff members , some parents said their fears had been eased , but others said they would not return their children to school until the situation was more clear we were all happy to hear the doctors say that nobody else has shown up with symptoms of the disease , said pedro rivera , a police officer he said he was planning to keep his 6yearold daughter , melina , in school , but i 'll keep my eyes on her but francisco morales , a construction worker , said he had come to get his 8yearold son , benjamin , after the school called to say he had a little headache the third grader said he did not need to go to the doctor , but his father was adamant i'm going to take him to the hospital , he said photo andres maldonado , a first grader at public school 132 in washington heights , died of meningococcal meningitis on monday parents of students arrived at the school yesterday to hear health officials discuss the bacterial disease the officials said not to panic but to remain vigilant \( john sotomayor the new york times \) map of washington heights showing location of public school 132

the coach likes to teach his sport to his players , but he does n't appreciate the skeptical attention of the news media and he does n't seek the fickle approval of the fans so where does he go to pursue his career \? for jacques lemaire , the choice was metropolitan new york city , media capital of the world and the most populous urban center in north america it might seem an odd choice but for someone from the hockey hothouse of montreal , where lemaire grew up , played at a hall of fame level and later coached , it made perfect sense lemaire , the firstyear coach of the new jersey devils , toils safely west of the hudson river in new jersey , hidden from a spotlight that shines more brightly on other sports he has the team off to a 70 start , the best in its history , but on a good day , the devils might rank fifth or sixth in local sports consciousness that s fine with lemaire i do n't like to go on tv and yap , he said recently i want to go about my business secretly i want my privacy that might change beginning tonight , when the devils play the stanley cup champion montreal canadiens at byrne meadowlands arena certainly lemaire and his team will be the focus of attention in the national hockey league in two languages , the radio , television and newspaper reporters from canada will want to know jacques , what is the secret of your success \? jacques , do n't you miss the bigtime atmosphere of montreal \? and , by the way , jacques , why did you change the right point man during the second minute of the fourth power play of the third period \? in anticipation of their arrival , the devils last week faxed an unusual memo throughout the league it warned broadcasters that lemaire and his top assistant , larry robinson , wo n't be available on game days for personal radio or television interviews it s a strange attitude for a team that struggles for fans in a league that craves publicity but , for those who know jacques lemaire , it s a logical demand from a private man in a public role he s does n't like glamor , he wants to be alone , said serge savard , the montreal general manager who played with lemaire on the canadiens' championship teams of the 1970s another former teammate is bob gainey , the coach and general manager of the dallas stars , who was still playing when lemaire coached the canadiens for 124 regular season and playoff games in 1984 and 1985 jacques is not someone who craves support for what he is doing , gainey said and this is an era in which a coach has become a celebrity whether he enjoys it or not game comes first , and second lemaire prefers anonymity , especially on the day of the game if i spend the day of the game talking to the press , i wo n't be talking to my team or thinking about the game , lemaire said the game is the most important thing last week , on a day between games at his west orange office , lemaire was generous with his time and his words this is n't bobby knight , looking for a fight , or even bruce coslet , the jet football coach who wears the chip on his shoulder like an epaulet still , there is this cool distance with lemaire , who offered a visitor a cup of coffee before taking a phone call and chatting briefly in french then , he sat for a 30minute interview the board behind his head showed diagrams of puck and player movement in the corridor outside the room , the walls were covered with team pictures , almost every one of them with a different coach lemaire \( it translates roughly to the mayor \) , earned 10 stanley cup rings with the canadiens , eight as a player and two as an assistant general manager , his job until he joined the devils late last june he centered the first line for canadiens teams that won four consecutive titles in the late 1970s that roster produced many of the men who run hockey teams today , including savard , robinson and gainey steve shutt , one of lemaire s linemates , is a montreal assistant coach doug risebrough is the general manager of the calgary flames scotty bowman , the canadiens coach then , now directs the detroit red wings lemaire said he learned a lot from bowman , but he seemed to wince and chuckle at the same time when he remembered bowman s motivational techniques , how bowman would keep players offbalance with unprovoked displays of anger during winning streaks and how he would embarrass them by showing their mistakes on videotape during team meetings i'm not the same , he said , but , at times i will do certain things like that to keep the guys on their toes lemaire is a short , solidlybuilt man with little hair , blond on top and gray on the sides he has a round face , giving him the look of the maninthemoon his eyes are dark and darting and his emotions surface there first in his book the game , former montreal goalie ken dryden described lemaire competing with teammates who were pitching quarters against a curb while waiting for the team bus he looks far from formidable , dryden wrote it s his face that fools you but do n't be fooled lemaire won that particular contest , collecting everyone s coins no one is a better biggame player , dryden wrote
for the last few months , a nurse named linda conroy has been prowling hartford s most impoverished neighborhoods , seeking out children who have not been immunized her job is to give injections to preschool youngsters in their homes , and it is a job that has given her a new view of humanity six months ago , she said , i 'd walk around those streets with my eyes wide open and my mouth wide open i 've learned to be streetwise but now i love this job you know you make a difference here for many children , going to the doctor and getting shots against measles , mumps , polio and other maladies is part of the ritual of growing up no family doctors but for most of the youngsters of the city s poorest neighborhoods there is no family doctor a city hospital , its emergency room or a clinic , substitutes for the doctor and some children simply fall through the cracks their parents do not remember to take them to the clinic for immunization shots , or do n't know about their importance , or do n't have transportation , or do n't understand instructions because they do n't understand english more often than not , searching is a major part of ms conroy s job people in poor neighborhoods , just as in wealthier ones , are suspicious of someone who simply shows up at the door some will not answer a knock some will deny they live there many speak no english ms conroy is sometimes accompanied by a spanishspeaking interpreter and sometimes by a man of late , she has gone out more and more alone she said she needed to gain the confidence of people to get in , and alone she posed no threat she never wears a nurse s uniform since that would identify her as part of the establishment ms conroy s work , which is supported by a twoyear 106 , 500 grant to st francis hospital and medical center by the greater hartford jaycees , is known as good start and believed to be a unique program in the united states the director of the home health agency at st francis , margaret ambrose , said the hospital tried to determine if any other program exists in the united states to innoculate children in their homes and could find none after six months , ms conroy said she has given immunization shots to 88 children surprisingly , the hartford plan was prompted by what is common medical practice in siberia , a huge region nearly twice as large as the united states and generally only known to americans as the cold , harsh land where the soviet government traditionally sent dissidents and other prisoners several years ago , before the end of the cold war , an alliance was formed between two doctors who work with children , one in hartford and the other in irkutsk , a region of eastern siberia that is 100 times bigger than connecticut but has fewer people the doctors are frederick b berrien , director of ambulatory pediatrics at st francis hospital , and vladimir podkamenev , director of the institute of pediatrics of the eastern siberian branch of the academy of medical sciences in irkutsk both had been active in international physicians for the prevention of nuclear war , the organization that received the 1985 nobel peace prize , and out of correspondence between them grew what is known as the siberianamerican children s health program the program , started in 1991 , seeks to identify causes for the high incidence of childhood diseases and mortality in irkutsk , and last year five doctors from connecticut went to irkutsk for a conference with siberian doctors another conference is planned later this year , again in siberia , and some siberian doctors have visited st francis hospital over the last few years to gain insight in the handing of children s diseases in the united states in turn , dr berrien said , hartford has gained by copying the siberian system of giving young children immunization shots at home it was the inspiration for 'good start' here , he said dr loudmila v bregel , director of the pediatric clinic in irkutsk , said that giving immunization shots at home has been done for years there out of necessity many people who lived far out in rural areas could not bring their children to a clinic because they had no transportation , so the medical people had to go to them back to world war ii dr bregel visited dr berrien at st francis hospital in april and , in an interview , both painted a word picture of the irkutsk region during world war ii the soviet government started to move factories , sometimes intact , to siberia so they could operate without fear of bombing since then , more factories have been established there today , dr bregel said , the several hundred thousand residents of the metropolitan area of irkutsk are plagued by chemical factories that pour out noxious discharges look at this , dr berrien said he assembled several pictures to make up a panorama of the siberian city over the entire length was a great cloud of pollutants there have been 500 different chemical pollutants identified in the air above irkutsk , said dr bregel chilling statistics what has resulted , he said , are chilling statistics 54 percent of the children in the area are considered developmentally and neurologically impaired , 50 percent have poor responses to infection , infant mortality rates have risen to 25 per 1 , 000 births , compared to the united states rate of 8 per 1 , 000 births the rate in hartford , one of the poorest cities in this country , is 10 or 11 deaths per 1 , 000 births , said dr berrien , and in a few of the most devastated neighborhoods may climb to 18 or 20 deaths dr bregel does not like to talk about the politics that led up to the environmental nightmare in her native land but she admits that since the breakup of the soviet union the bleak situation has been compounded by acute shortages in her field we have enough physicians , she said , but we do not have enough equipment , enough technology , enough transportation to bring sick babies to the city photo

these are the days when paul e tsongas had hoped to be preparing to move into the white house instead , after falling by the wayside in last year s democratic presidential primaries , the former senator from massachusetts is now being treated in a boston hospital in a new battle against cancer during the primaries , mr tsongas dealt with the issue of his health by saying he had fully recovered from cancer two of his doctors repeatedly said he had been cancerfree since undergoing a bone marrow transplant in 1986 for lymphoma , a cancer of the immune system but in april , a few days after the new york primary , the doctors acknowledged that lymphoma had been found in a lymph node in his armpit in 1987 then last month , the former senator disclosed that he had developed a new type of lymphoma acknowledging mistakes in making that announcement , mr tsongas said he had erred in not providing full disclosure moreover , the danafarber cancer institute , a harvard teaching hospital where he is being treated , now concedes that it made a number of mistakes in connection with the way the candidate s health was described by his doctors mr tsongas s illness and the institute s concession , coming at the time of a transition at the white house , raise several issues regarding the proper balance between a politician s right to privacy and the public s need to know about a candidate s health the concession also focuses new attention on whether hospitals and doctors have an ethical responsibility to provide full information about the health of political leaders when authorized to speak on their behalf and whether election laws should be changed to require some disclosure by presidential candidates in some cases , candidates and officials have covered up or misled the public about their illnesses the public s need for full disclosure no less than the outcome of the 1992 presidential primaries , and thus the election itself , could have been influenced by the danafarber doctors' withholding of critical information if a full disclosure had come before mr tsongas won the first primary in new hampshire , the other candidates might have performed better and emerged in a stronger position to challenge bill clinton for the democratic nomination last month , in conceding that he had erred , mr tsongas called for a national commission to determine how much information a presidential candidate should release about his health other political leaders and ethics scholars said in interviews that the ground rules about disclosure should be understood in advance by patient and doctor but that illness should not disqualify anyone from seeking office a rival of mr tsongas s during democratic primaries , senator bob kerrey of nebraska , said in an interview that full disclosure of a presidential candidate s health has to become part of our election law clearly , we need to develop procedures that should be a condition of receiving federal campaign funds and secret service protection , mr kerrey said dr herbert l abrams , author of the president has been shot \( w w norton , 1991 \) , which argued that the the 25th amendment on disability should have gone into effect after the assassination attempt on president ronald reagan , said the time had come to reexamine an old proposal to create an independent group of experts appointed by medical societies to review health problems of presidents when they arose such a committee could also review candidates' the medical records , dr abrams said there would be great difficulty in denying them access to the whole medical record , thus avoiding the type of problem that arose in mr tsongas s case , said dr abrams , a former member of the harvard faculty dr abrams also said that presidentelect clinton should disclose his full medical records , adding , there is no reason why he should be exempted from the general proposition that his medical history is public property mr clinton has declined to be interviewed about his health , citing privacy concerns placing blame at the hospital after danafarber came under criticism earlier this year for not having given a full account of mr tsongas s cancer , the institute s president , prof christopher t walsh , appointed an internal review committee that found that many policies had not been followed when mr tsongas s main doctors , ronald w takvorian and george p canellos , publicly discussed the case danafarber made a bevy of mistakes , its physician in chief , dr david m livingston , said in an interview mr tsongas s cancerous node was a relapse , and in this disease it is not a good sign for the future , dr livingston said he disputed dr takvorian , who insisted in an interview that the solitary node was not significant professor walsh said , the record should have been fully disclosed so people could make their own evaluation of how the recurrence affected mr tsongas s prognosis the report led to a new policy , professor walsh said when a public figure waives confidentiality , the hospital will write a summary of the medical records , and doctors not connected with the case will review the summary before its release the patient cannot have a hand in writing or editing the report also , professor walsh said , any spokesman for the institute must be free of the existence of any real , apparent or potential conflict of interest
a day after he reinstated 10 principals stripped of their bronx school posts because of accusations that their hiring was part of a corrupt process , schools chancellor ramon c cortines endured a barrage of criticism from the dinkins administration and others , who characterized his decision as a blunder that would have the effect of endorsing graft first deputy mayor norman steisel , two mayoral appointees to the board of education , school employees and parent leaders had reactions that ranged from mild censure to furious reproach even mr cortines s supporters on the sevenmember board of education grumbled that they had not been consulted , though they said they agreed with the chancellor s arguments that the reinstatement would restore stability to one of the city s most troubled districts on wednesday , mr cortines reinstated 10 principals in bronx school district 12 who had been dismissed last june by thenchancellor joseph a fernandez mr cortines , who assumed his post just six weeks ago , seemed surprised by the depth of the criticism , the most adamant since he arrived a widening breach there s no use kidding about it , this was just awful , said victor gotbaum , one of mayor david n dinkins s two appointees to the board of education he ca n't say he s going to worry only about education , and not about corruption these issues commingle he s working 16 hours a day sooner or later he had to make a mistake now he s in a very tough way ed stancik , the special commissioner for investigation of the new york city school district , whose report on the selling of principalships in district 12 in the bronx led to the mass dismissal of the administrators in june , continued his attacks on mr cortines s decision yesterday , widening the public breach between the school system s chief executive and its chief watchdog mr steisel , after phoning both mr cortines and mr stancik to hear their views , expressed support for mr stancik the mayor created ed stancik s office , supports him , and thinks he s done a yeomanlike job rooting out corruption , mr steisel said the chancellor said he was willing to take a chance with these people at the same time he said he wo n't tolerate corruption that sent a very confused signal at best so he s put himself into a very tough position mr cortines , expressing bewilderment at the outcry , said he had sought to act in the best interests of teachers , parents and students by bringing an end to a disruptive period i think it s interesting that a great many people are quarterbacking my management of the system , mr cortines said but how many of them have visited those bronx schools as i have how many have worked with that board as i have this is a district that has changed there is a new board , and at least verbally there is an effort to do things right mr cortines s predecessor , joseph a fernandez , dismissed the nine principals and one assistant principal in district 12 in june after conducting a casebycase review of more than 40 administrators hired during a twoyear period in which mr stancik said all hiring in the district was guided by corruption and patronage district 12 includes 22 schools in the east tremont and morris park sections court steps in none of the 10 supervisors were ever removed from their schools because before the dismissals were to take effect on june 30 , a court injunction halted mr fernandez s order by reinstating the principals , mr cortines said he wanted to remove the cloud hanging over their careers so that they could devote full attention to teaching the public outcry had no effect on the reinstatement no one disputed mr cortines s power to make his decision neither mr dinkins nor his republicanliberal mayoral challenger , rudolph w giuliani , whose board supporters helped mr cortines get his job , commented yesterday on the dispute i do n't think you can focus on education by ignoring corruption , mr stancik said yesterday in a television program moderated by former mayor edward i koch i think that the forces that benefit from corruption are looking very carefully at chancellor cortines right now mr koch interjected people ought to know that these 10 who were removed because of the process were not themselves found guilty of corruption , mr koch said nevertheless , i think that joe fernandez was absolutely right and that cortines is starting off on the wrong foot parents voice outrage some parents and school employees in district 12 also voiced outrage i think this was lousy , said ruby pearl carmichael , who has worked as a school aide in public school 134 for a decade our kids are going down , this is only going to make things worse eugenia irizarry , a former district 12 board member who cooperated with mr stancik s investigation said she was flabbergasted by mr cortines s decision the chancellor is basically saying that the patronage and the politics can just continue , she said ms irizarry questioned whether the lawyer representing the district 12 school board , ruben franco , a puerto rican politician who knows mr cortines , might have sought to persuade mr cortines to reinstate the principals in an interview , mr cortines acknowledged his friendship with mr franco but he said that he has not spoken to mr franco since he assumed the chancellorship and that the friendship in no way influenced his decision mr franco said he knew mr cortines but has not spoken to him since his arrival in new york they were both part of a delegation of hispanic americans that visited israel three years ago ayo harrington , president of the united parents association , a citywide parent advocacy group , said she had received many calls from parents criticizing the decision we consider this a rash , dangerous and extremely hurtful decision , ms harrington said we are in shock carol gresser , the president of the central board of education and a member of the fourmember majority that hired mr cortines , said i am firmly convinced that the chancellor s action was taken in the best educational interests of the children in district 12 , after he personally visited the district and carefully weighed all the issues another member of the board s majority , ninfa segarra , the bronx representative , said she was sure that the chancellor looked at the entire record before making his decision i defer to the chancellor , she said chart investigators' findings administrators in district 12 when the new york city board of education s earlyretirement incentives

the eagles thought they could the eagles blitzed four linebackers on the play and both safeties cheated toward the line of scrimmage in part because of the left to right motion of cowboys tight end jay novacek before the snap two eagles linebackers were in the middle , and cowboys center mark stepnoski bullied the left one and johnston handled the right one a gaping hole was the result and smith did the rest , straight up the middle and just past diving cornerback eric allen into the end zone smith loves the play for two reasons he generally prefers running traps and delays inside as opposed to sweeps outside , and he prefers following blockers who are constantly on the move having johnston with a quick , first block out of the backfield makes his initial read quicker and his running more effective dallas has ridden lead draw , smith s return and production in nearly every phase of its game to five straight victories after opening with consecutive losses when smith was absent because of contract problems smith has been more than a bandaid dallas is a young team and smith is a pivotal young leader he inspires his teammates with his temperament , lockerroom folly , preparation and results the cowboys rally around him there was so much gleam in so many cowboys' eyes after the eagles game especially among the dallas offensive linemen that one would have thought any one of them had just rushed for 237 yards , smith s total which tied the sixthhighest singlegame rushing performance in nfl history several cowboys took special note of this smith managed the run on his 30th carry in the game s final moments in horrible , rainy weather that is stamina that is a true star he has 549 rushing yards now in five games barry sanders leads the league with 790 in eight games emmitt has a 5 or 6yard first burst like barry sanders and he keeps tight and low to the ground , the eagles' allen said you never get a good shot at him i 've been telling our younger backs to watch him and learn from him , how he stays low i thought i could catch him on that long one he started to weave toward the middle just when i got close and dove it was a smart move philadelphia had hoped to string smith east and west that simply does not happen often smith runs on the field in the manner that he lives off it he makes rocksolid decisions and sticks with them eagles coach rich kotite said that , sure , smith is a premier back and troy aikman is a premier quarterback and michael irvin is a premier receiver , but he wants everyone to know that dallas has one heck of a premiere offensive line in starters stepnoski at center , mark tuinei and erik williams at guards and nate newton and kevin cogan at tackles with the kind of holes kotite saw on sunday , he said that nearly anyone could have waltzed through them newton said no i can think of three or four backs , maybe barry sanders , barry foster , thurman thomas and rodney hampton , who could have done what emmitt did , but the fact is , none of them ever have , newton said he did it without training camp and after missing the first two games , but anyone that knows emmitt knew he would be in shape and would start hitting his stride about now emmitt always tells the offensive linemen here one thing , keep moving no matter what , if you 're beaten and the rusher is sliding the wrong way , he says just keep moving and blocking the rusher that way emmitt reads and reacts to that with no wasted steps or motion that s what we do , and he takes it from there philadelphia and the giants shared something in common in the preseason both teams had games where their defensive front was shredded by power linemen and by power rushing attacks both teams regrouped and patched together their fronts and got off to fast starts in the regular season but when the nfc east battles and dallas rolled around for the eagles , their most glaring defensive weakness , up front , was exposed are the giants next \? the way dallas is soaring , the bandwagon is growing full of admirers who believe the cowboys may not lose another game , including super bowl xxviii true supremacy in the nfc east is at stake on sunday and look no further than the dallas offensive line against the giants' defensive line to find which way the game swings the feeling here is that dallas will win that battle and that the giants' best chance to match it is to somehow win a highscoring , bigplay affair of offensive tit for tat and , along the way , devise and execute an extensive and persistent plan to thwart lead draw

nairobi , kenya , july 14 with mogadishu smoldering in anger and violence , the united nations peacekeeping operation in somalia is finding that its fundamental mission to restore order is proving increasingly elusive but it is premature to say that the united nations effort has bogged down in the quagmire of a protracted guerrilla war many united nations and united states officials say they believe that the united nations can turn the situation around and restore peace to mogadishu if it quickly arrests the fugitive somali clan leader , gen mohammed farah aidid time , however , is widely thought to be running out general aidid , accused by the united nations of masterminding the ambush that killed 24 pakistani peacekeepers on june 5 , has been in hiding for more than three weeks the united nations has hit his headquarters and other command centers with massive air and ground attacks it is offering a 25 , 000 reward for information leading to his capture yet general aidid has continued to organize guerrilla strikes against the united nations and has severely weakened the organization s credibility in somalia divide and rule strategy he has also practiced his version of divide and rule , fostering a deepening rift between the united nations , which will not negotiate with him , and italy , an integral part of the united nations force here the italians are threatening to pull out of mogadishu if the united nations does not back off militarily and begin negotiating the rift became even more open today when the italian commander was removed for refusing to carry out united nations orders general aidid and his several hundred staunch supporters have proved strong adversaries of the roughly 20 , 000 united nations troops from 24 countries , more than 13 , 000 are in mogadishu united nations military officials say they expect another 6 , 000 in the next month before they begin the process of disarming the city and patrolling it in large numbers on the surface , the streets of mogadishu are still bustling but violence has continued every day for the last 39 days , forcing the entire united nations operation off the streets and into the fortress of the huge compound of the former united states embassy the latest united nations military strike on monday only fueled the intense bitterness many somalis in mogadishu now feel toward the organization angry mobs turned on four journalists and beat them to death and with little visible united nations military presence , the capital has become a no man s land controlled by snipers and somali militia who now target any foreigner un success in countryside in many ways , outside of mogadishu , the united nations operation is a success somalia has won a new lease on life in baidoa and bardera , towns where hundreds of people were dying of starvation every day last year , the united nations no longer needs to distribute food the crops are good , if not yet sufficient to feed the entire population in the towns , gunmen have disappeared , replaced by troops from various countries united nations officials are continuing talks with clan leaders throughout southern somalia and say the somalis want to cooperate with the international effort and disarm the country most towns are creating a new somali police force , the first step toward building a government but the chaos in mogadishu has also fed a growing instability in the countryside banditry is still a major problem and united nations troops still have to escort all relief convoys somali clan and faction leaders , capitalizing on the fact that general aidid is being attacked by the united nations , are jockeying for power although they all say they want to cooperate with the united nations , none have voluntarily begun disarming so far everyone is watching and waiting to see what the united nations will do next and in mogadishu , the situation appears almost out of control senior united nations military officials say that the latest strike has crippled general aidid and his supporters and that order will quickly be restored in the city but relief officials and the italian government insist that negotiating with general aidid is the only way to achieve peace despite the violence , relief operations are continuing two unpleasant choices they have two choices and both of them are lousy , said michael mcdonagh , director of irish concern in mogadishu they can negotiate and bring some sort of peace and normality back , or they can unleash an unwinnable , protracted guerrilla war the united nations should n't have declared aidid a wanted man now they 've backed him into a corner many somalis say they have lost faith in the united nations united nations officials say that once general aidid is arrested , the dialogue between all factions and the united nations as well as relief activities can resume and the process of reconstruction will flourish but until then peace is on hold and the standoff continues and in the latest round today , somali militants in mogadishu called on muslims worldwide to kill americans in their countries the statement was made in leaflets distributed throughout mogadishu and signed by the muslim voice , a publication believed to be associated with general aidid s faction , reuters reported the leaflets said somali militants would launch an attack against american compounds in mogadishu

geneva , jan 2 leaders of five factions involved in the war in bosnia and herzegovina today began preliminary discussions of a proposal to redraw the republic based on a detailed map that carves it into 10 provinces in presenting the justcompleted map , lord owen of britain , cochairman of the talks here , told the leaders of three separate bosnian delegations representing serbs , croats and muslims , and representatives from croatia and serbia , that the proposal was based on an attempt to arbitrate the conflicting territorial claims of the three ethnic groups a demilitarized sarajevo under the plan , bosnia would relinquish most governmental functions to the provinces lord owen said that if the plan was accepted , sarajevo would be demilitarized and the new provinces would be areas as geographically coherent as possible , taking into account ethnic , geographical , historical , communication , economic viability and other relevant factors the map envisages three provinces in which the muslims would be predominant , one in which the ethnic serbs would be predominant , and five in which power would be shared by muslims and croats or serbs a united nations spokesman said that none of the provinces would be ethnically pure , an aspect the bosnian government had feared in any plan to redraw the former yugoslav republic the bosnian government has said it wants to maintain the territorial integrity of the bosnian state , but has been willing to support the idea of territorial entities if they are not based on ethnic partitioning although the serbs technically would have control of only one province , the area where it would share power is broad and includes two enclaves lying within or beside provinces where muslim majorities prevail under the proposal , serbian and croatian forces would be called upon to withdraw to specific provinces and the remainder of the provinces would have to reach local agreement on deployments in addition , the united nations ban on military flights over bosnia would remain in force with the exception of medical evacuation flights the framework for a new constitution outlines provincial and central government legislatures that would be elected democratically , with most governmental functions carried out by its provinces the presidency would be organized on the basis of parity among the ethnic groups , and a constitutional court would be created with a member from each ethnic group but with a majority of nonbosnian judges chosen by the conference cochairmen artillery duels reported as 25 official delegates took their seats around a rectangular table at 11 am today , there were reports of scattered artillery duels between bosnian muslim and bosnian serb forces from various regions of the republic cyrus r vance , a former secretary of state and the other cochairman of the conference , told the delegates the process we are starting today can make the difference between peace and war , between life and death for thousands of people those gathered around this table have it in their power to prevent it from sliding into escalation or expansion of the conflict the meeting was closed , but a united nations official who attended said all sides spoke quite moderately none of their statements were released to the press radovan karadzic , the bosnian serb whose forces hold twothirds of the mountainous republic s territory , warned that his side would not willingly give up what he called serb lands in bosnia , the united nations official said mr karadzic did declare that he wanted a peace settlement and would stay as long as necessary to achieve that , the united nations official said mr karadzic also said he would close camps where some 1 , 333 muslim and croat prisoners are held , according to the official in discussions with mr vance and lord owen before the conference he made some territorial concessions muslim delegation 'very glum' president alija izetbegovic of bosnia declared that all sides must accept the peace plan he acknowledged holding 847 serb prisoners and said he agreed to opening his detention camps to international red cross inspection the united nations official said the bosnian delegation was very glum he noted that on friday night mr izetbegovic had declared to his delegation , we are under duress war is the only solution the leader of the bosnian croats , mate boban , whose forces have seized a large chunk of bosnia , agreed with the principles behind the plan , a united nations official said lord owen said that sarajevo should be demilitarized at the earliest possible date and recreated as an open city with three access routes across lines of military confrontation these routes would effectively lift the siege of sarajevo , he said he said the plan included a proposal for five throughways in the republic in which there would be full freedom of movement to be guaranteed by international forces these forces would also control crossings between provinces to insure that military units did not transgress observers at border under the plan , united nations observers would be posted at border points , lord owen said , but the sanctity of the borders in terms of arms smuggling would also have to be guaranteed by the authorities of neighboring croatia , serbia and montenegro dobrica cosic , the president of the yugoslav republic , consisting of serbia and montenegro , attended the talks , as did president franjo tudjman of croatia mr cosic , said it was high time the siege of sarajevo should be ended the siege is now in its ninth month mr cosic , whose republic is indirectly involved in the bosnian fighting , also said that a settlement could be the seed for a different future for the balkans mr tudjman thanked the united nations for its efforts to bring peace to bosnia , noting that mr vance had succeeded in ending the war between croatia and serbia just one year ago the urgency of the talks was underscored here on friday by secretary general boutros boutrosghali of the united nations , who said this was the last chance for peace in the balkans mr boutrosghali and his deputies have discussed the mounting pressure for international military intervention from some western leaders including president bush , president francois mitterrand of france and prime minister john major of britain his deputies conducting the international conference on former yugoslavia here have warned all week of a buildup of 10 , 000 mostly muslim troops on mount igman , southwest of sarajevo they said the troops might try to break the ninemonth siege of the capital by bosnian serb forces working groups formed after the delegates heard the presentation by the cochairmen and the comments of the delegation leaders , two working groups were formed to discuss the proposals , the first on lifting the siege of sarajevo and disengaging military forces throughout the republic and the second on the drafting of the new constitution characterizing the first day of talks , fred eckhard , the spokesman for the cochairmen , said that leaders of all five delegations had demonstrated a serious willingness to negotiate

at halftime of tomorrow night s knicks76ers game at madison square garden , there will be another basketball game , one that seasonticket holders had not bargained for it will be a brief scrimmage played by black and hasidic young people from the crown heights neighborhood s project cure increase the peace basketball teams not long ago , the knicks were approached with the idea for the scrimmage and their enlightened management bought it the knicks are calling the evening racial harmony night , with anthony mason , the knicks' homegrown forward from queens , as the designated spokesman and awards presenter the name crown heights , however , has a recent history that immediately conjures up anything but racial harmony in august 1991 , after an automobile in a procession that was carrying the lubavitch grand rabbi accidentally struck and killed a black 7yearold boy , some blacks went on a rampage through the streets of that section of brooklyn , screaming kill the jews and somebody indeed murdered one , stabbing to death an hasidic scholar from australia tensions that had been simmering for years between the two communities , which live literally side by side , had erupted into the nightmare that many had dreaded many citizens in the neighborhood are now deadly serious about wanting to do something to ease the fear and loathing playing games together to promote understanding is , they believe , as good a way as any at least , they feel , understanding must start someplace sometimes it does understanding often comes in oneonone situations i 've thought about this because i 've played basketball on various levels , from grade school to high school to college , from the parks and the schoolyards to alleys where , as we grew up in a racially mixed neighborhood , we tossed a rubber ball through a loose drain pipe extending from the roof of a garage there was a refrain in the schoolyards that i will always remember i'm sitting waiting for next when a guy walks off the street in his sneakers and asks , can i run wichya \? yeah , sure you can , i say he s black , he s hispanic , he s white , he s hasidic , he might even be a she , for , as time goes on , more and more women are playing basketball in situations like this , and playing well , which was disconcerting to veteran male hoopsters when the new era began but change and being thrust into new situations with different people can always throw someone off their game it can crush stereotypes and wipe out cliches at bryant grammar school on the west side of chicago , i could jump better than willie rockett , who was black , but not as well as tommy swope , another black in a christmas tournament for public high schools at the international amphitheater , my school , sullivan , an allwhite north side team , played carver , an allblack south side team the game went on at 9 am it was freezing outside , and freezing inside in the huge empty auditorium , because the heating system had broken down we would have played in our parkas if we could have none of us ever warmed up , and they beat us , 2927 afterward , all of us shared the few showers available in the one locker room , laughing together when our jaws unlocked , comrades in cold at roosevelt university , which i attended for two years , the coach of the racially mixed team was edwin turner , a gentle and perceptive black man by strength of character , he maintained respect he knew what he was doing he was n't always right , to be sure , and might take me out of a game when i knew just knew that i was about to turn my game around but it never surprised me , in later years , to find that a black could coach a pro basketball team , or football team , or could manage a bigleague baseball club , as well or as poorly , as a white man in the army , there was a black man , ron hamilton , with whom i played basketball on the fort gordon , ga , base hamilton had played at tennessee state and later the cleveland pipers one afternoon we learned that we could play at an american legion gym in nearby augusta this was in the summer of 1959 six of us , five whites and hamilton , joyously drove over the doors happened to be locked we were deeply disappointed on the way back , as the sun was setting , i noticed a beautiful outdoor court , like a mirage i shouted stop the car ! we 're in luck ! but the driver knew better in that time , if we had played , we would have courted disaster , since blacks in the south then did n't play in games with whites i had never hated segregation never hated hatred any more than i did then hamilton remained silent i felt his anger and frustration years later , i wrote a book with walt frazier clyde and i used to play oneonone together \( we will not discuss the scores \) i came to appreciate not only his extraordinary physical skills , but also his insights into the game it was the latter , i am convinced , that made him the champion he was everyone , frazier once told me , has a certain rhythm that he dribbles to at one time , there was a prevalent cliche among whites that said this if a team with mostly blacks was to succeed , it needed a smart white guard in some of the knicks' best days , they had white players bradley , debusschere and lucas up front , with frazier or monroe or barnett handling the ball and a brainier backcourt you could never find i do n't know if project cure increase the peace will cure the ills i do n't know if racial harmony night will work but i know it ca n't hurt it is , after all , indefinably sweet when someone asks , can i run wichya \? and the answer is , yeah , sure you can
jimmy heath colden center queens college one of the better things about jimmy heath s orchestrations is their garrulousness mr heath has composed a handful of jazz standards , from cta to gingerbread boy , with a firm mathematical structure , logical and straightforward when he orchestrates them , they blossom and become encrusted with ideas , subplots , asides , whispers and echoes , all elbowing one another for attention none of this creative effusion backfires mr heath is one of the finest bigband writers working , if that s the word for somebody whose orchestrations are heard in public once a year or so mr heath spends half his time as a gunslinging saxophonist and half as a music professor at queens college friday night s show at the colden center allowed an audience to hear music he has been perfecting over the last 40 years , most recently with the help of a student band but mr heath brought in a group of musicians who would quickly coalesce into an important orchestra if financial circumstances allowed them to keep playing together the group included the pianist barry harris , who delivered some pearly and balanced bebop solos the trumpeters jon faddis and virgil jones the trombonists benny powell , john mosca and slide hampton , and on reeds , jerome richardson , bill easley , danny bank , loren schoenberg and antonio hart they performed the music with real wit and a sense of play , even when they occasionally forgot their cues when the band overshot a tune s structure , leaving some blank spaces , smiles broke out before a soloist stood up to take over there were some surprises mr richardson , rarely heard as a soloist , jammed his improvisation on gemini with odd notes and liquid lines mr heath kept precise riffs ready for the improvisers , and on gingerbread boy , he , mr easley and mr schoenburg swapped ideas , each trying to swing harder than the others the rhythm section , ben brown on bass and lewis nash on drums , never let anybody coast , pushing and prodding the improvisers and moving mr heath s arrangements with the power and grace they deserve
mexico city , april 26 the cocacola company announced today that it would spend 195 million to buy a 30 percent stake in the soft drink operation of fomento economico mexicano sa , the monterreybased company that holds coke s biggest foreign franchise the move raises cocacola s stakes in what has become one of the most important theaters of its global struggle with pepsicola international mexico s percapita cola consumption is second only to that of the united states , and the nation s thirst is expected to grow for years , with or without ratification of the north american free trade agreement the proposed sale values the softdrink arm of femsa , as the mexican company is known , at 650 million , or 158 times the division s 1992 earnings the figure is considerably less than some beverage industry analysts had forecast , and the price of femsa shares fell nearly 4 percent today to close at 386 on mexico city s bolsa de valores last month , pepsi international announced that it would spend 115 million on equity stakes in its franchises in monterrey , guadalajara , mexico city s suburbs and other parts of the country pepsi said it would spend another 635 million to expand its operations around mexico over the next five years to a large degree , this is a defensive move by cocacola , said carlos laboy , an analyst at james capel inc in new york but it s a good way to counter pepsi s moves and it s a good way for cocacola to acquire greater management control over its largest franchise in the world in a first rejoinder last week , cocacola announced that its system would spend 3 billion in mexico over the next five years half of the amount is to go into advertising and promotions , while the other half is to be invested in the renovation and expansion of cocacola s bottling and distribution operations and the building of eight new plants by borrowing new money and selling shares , femsa refrescos sa , as the softdrink unit is called , will contribute a third of the money for improvements femsa s general director , othon ruiz montemayor , said the soft drink unit would spend the money to build a megaplant in the mexico city valley and a bottling plant in the southern state of oaxaca , and to upgrade its distribution network , warehouses and other bottling plants industry analysts said they expected cocacola s investment in the femsa subsidiary , the company s first equity stake in a latin american bottler , to quickly turn the franchise into an even more important cog in coke s operations in the region officials of the two companies said femsa refrescos would be reconstituted as a debtfree company a factor that seemed to account in part for the unexpectedly low multiple of earnings reflected in the sale latin american foothold they said that in addition to spending 500 million over the next five years to modernize and expand production and distribution capacities , the unit might also buy or take over franchises in other parts of mexico and elsewhere in latin america the soft drink unit is to get a separate listing on stock exchanges in mexico and abroad femsa officials said they would soon offer as much as 19 percent of their share in the subsidiary for public sale cocacola s chairman , roberto c goizueta , left open the possibility that coke might try to increase its stake , but its executive vice president , john hunter , said later that coke had no such plans under the sale arrangement , coke is to have four seats on the board of the soft drink unit femsa gets five seats , including that of the chairman industry analysts have voiced concern , echoed privately by some cocacola company officials , that the conglomerate that owns 51 percent of femsa , valores industriales sa , or visa , has not been focusing sufficiently on soft drinks in october 1991 , visa s management led the purchase from the government of the secondbiggest bank in mexico , bancomer sa , and used femsa to borrow 610 for the deal visa has also been hunting for strategic partners for its other ventures in beer , packaging and convenience stores market share claims pepsi has been moving aggressively in mexico , where it is believed to command about a quarter of all cola sales and slightly more than 20 percent of the entire market for soft drinks \( the competitors' claims of market share conflict , and there is no independent public estimate \) the country s biggest pepsi bottler , grupo embotelladora de mexico sa , or gemex , stole away some of femsa s market share in the mexico city valley last year by producing a returnable 15liter product more quickly and promoting it more heavily femsa has since won back the 55 percent share of the region s cola market that it previously enjoyed , but has had to scramble to keep up with gemex s innovations in distribution and sales tactics no call to arms coke and femsa officials announced the sale at a mexico city news conference at which they all seemed to be trying hard to sound as nondefensive as possible sitting behind a row of open coke bottles from which none of them drank they scrupulously avoided terms like pepsi and war referring obliquely to all the recent noise made by some of our competitors , mr goizueta said , we sell more than twice as much as they do battle intensifies but neither he nor other company executives seemed to challenge the notion of many industry analysts that femsa and cocacola will have to fight harder and differently to keep their huge share of the market generally in mexico , the advertising has n't been nearly so competitive a process and the focus has been on distribution , said timothy c davis , a latin america analyst at lazard freres company in new york but as the distribution networks develop , the market will become more like the united states , where the major softdrink producers battle over points of market share in comparison with most of the rest of the world , mexico is already a cola

ok , this clinches it it s the water in the potomac river that water goes into reservoirs around washington some of it reaches congress and we get the federal budget some is obviously affecting the people in charge of president clinton s image and most clearly , a big dose of eau de potomac has been imbibed by senior marine corps officers sitting in front of word processors in the pentagon so the marine generals decide they will take only unmarried recruits this is too rich even the roman catholic church is thinking that a singlesonly recruiting policy has not worked all that well the beauty part was the plan to have marine corps officers conduct marriage awareness training before the newly inducted recruit would be allowed to take a spouse this news has every standup comic and gag writer in america in a feeding frenzy but none could have outdone the gag lines in the directive itself , describing what would happen in these awareness sessions it is an opportunity for the marine to get counsel on one of the single most important decisions of his her life and benefit from the advice of seasoned marines who have experienced military family life you have to love the idea of seasoned marines conducting psychobabble sessions lance corporal him her , marriage is pretty much a beach assault in heavy sea conditions even if you do n't wear this uniform but try it as a marine and you 'll be pinned down by enfilade fire for years so take it from a hardened veteran of military family life , it is better to march than to marry and hey , trooper , let me help you with that dear john joan letter i 've busted up a hundred of these madcap schemes the commandant , gen carl e mundy jr , reportedly backed the zeromatrimony campaign , but he prudently said the directive had been issued without his knowledge it also seemed to sneak up on the secretary of defense and the commander in chief , who was really hoping to get off on vacation without another stupid pet trick david gergen , that plastic surgeon of untoward presidential moments , said the president was busy bragging on an army general when the marines ran amok when mr clinton got back to the oval office , why he had never , never , never , ever been so astonished so , no harm done defense secretary les aspin , recovering from his own bout of astonishment , reversed the marriage ban we can only say , flow on , intoxicating potomac and thank providence that washington got his inspiration along the delaware

sears , roebuck company is nearing an agreement to sell its coldwell banker residential services unit to the subsidiary s management and two investment groups , one of which includes the texas investor robert bass , people close to the negotiations said yesterday sears said in september that it was planning to sell the unit , which has more than 2 , 000 brokerage offices nationwide and a mortgage servicing group , as part of its effort to shift its energies back to its core business of retailing no estimate was available on what coldwell banker might fetch the backers of the management acquisition attempt are bain capital of boston and acadia partners , a partnership based in fort worth whose investors include mr bass while none of those involved sears , coldwell banker , acadia or bain would confirm that a sale was pending , people close to the negotiations confirmed a report in crain s chicago business that the talks are in final negotiations strengthening market the prospective purchasers are most likely interested in coldwell banker because the residential real estate market has recently strengthened as interest rates have declined many real estate companies , large and small , went out of business or cut back sharply as a result of the market s problems of the 1980 s and their further repercussions but coldwell banker , an established brokerage and relocation company that is one of the top in the country , said its residential real estate transactions last year increased 14 percent over the previous year , while total sales of existing homes in the united states were up only 9 percent for the year coldwell banker said that one in every nine homes sold in america in 1992 involved a coldwell banker sales associate the unit earned 19 million in the fourth quarter of 1992 , compared with 16 million in the comparable quarter a year earlier a coldwell banker spokeswoman referred calls to sears when asked about the report , perry chlan , a sears spokesman , said we have not announced any agreements regarding the planned sale of coldwell banker the actions related to the planned sale of coldwell banker are proceeding as planned owen blicksilver , a spokesman for acadia partners , said the group would have no comment adam kirsch , general partner of bain capital , said , we 're in the acquisitions business , and we ca n't comment on transactions whether or not we 're working on them joseph ronning , an analyst at brown brothers harriman , noted that coldwell banker had turned its business around over the past year , partly as result of tighter management and partly as a result of favorable market conditions 'best level' in years the residential real estate business appears to have turned , he said , adding that housing affordability is at its best level in a number of years consequently , the coldwell banker residential unit might well be considered a good investment with considerable growth potential if the economy remains stable or grows sears is known to be eager to spin off the unit , and has announced that it wants to have a deal completed by june further , both bain and acadia tend to invest where there is strong management , and a management buyout fits this strategy one analyst speculated that the attraction of the deal was the sears mortgage banking group , which operates as a part of coldwell banker the mortgage banking group , through its sears mortgage corporation , sears mortgage securities corporation and sears savings bank , increased its mortgage loan production 43 percent , to a record 1175 billion in 1992 , from 82 billion in 1991 two sales possible although this might be an attractive business for acadia and bain , one person close to the negotiations suggested that coldwell banker and the mortgage banking group would be sold separately for sears itself , the move is part of a strategy to shrink and concentrate on retailing , in line with its september announcement that it would sell its dean witter financial services unit and part of its allstate insurance group , as well as spin off coldwell banker when sears announced the plans in september , analysts said the moves would more than halve the company s 38 billion debt load the company started to accumulate debt in the 1980 s to finance its expansion into financial services , even as it invested money in store renovations and new promotions of its retail stock sears stock rose 3375 a share , to 4475 , on the day sears made its announcement in september yesterday , it gained 375 cents , to 53125 , in trading on the new york stock exchange
jerusalem , may 21 one day in march , maj gen amram mitzna of the israel defense forces took off his uniform , and said farewell to arms after three decades the next day , mr amram mitzna was back in his native haifa , pumping hands and looking for votes in the labor party primary for mayor it turned out not to be an enormous leap , he says his last army assignment put him in charge of longrange planning , which mayors supposedly do as well and his more than two years as military commander in the occupied west bank , in the early days of the palestinian uprising known as the intifada , required as much political savvy as battlefield knowhow side by side with fighting the intifada , we had to deal with palestinians , with israeli residents of the west bank , with politicians , with the media , he said each of these had to be done with sensitivity , which of course is important for a politician easily wins primary mr mitzna easily won his primary this week , making it likely that he will go on to victory in the november general election his success may be the first ripple in a nationwide wave , for there is a bumper crop this year of freshly retired generals running for mayor in a dozen cities the switch from barracks to back room is as old as israel itself these days , closeness between the two cultures is notable at the national level , where prime minister yitzhak rabin , army chief of staff during the 1967 war , relies heavily on the military and political advice of the current chief , lieut gen ehud barak but a dozen generals running for city hall at the same time is striking , although everyone can stand at ease , political experts say , explaining the phenomenon not as a sign of surging militarism but as a natural consequence of electoral trends israel has discovered local primaries with a vengeance in search of candidates with name recognition , the major parties have found a natural resource in career officers , many of whom are already national figures in a beleaguered country where the army commands great respect the generals are willing besides , the generals are often willing conscripts some of us see political life as a continuation of how to serve the country the best way we can , said ori orr , a retired major general who is chairman of parliament s foreign affairs and defense committee should the generals do well in local races this year , more may set their sights on parliament , especially as primaries spread on a national scale as it is , the israeli parliament has its fair share of them ten of the 120 members are former career military men that figure looks larger more than 10 percent if one discounts 25 lawmakers who are arabs or rigorously orthodox jews , none of whom serve in the army , or women , who are conscripted but who are all but invisible in the senior ranks no worry about militarism israel s former generals in parliament span the political spectrum , but tend to cluster at the center they are also conspicuous in the highest reaches of politics there is , of course , mr rabin , who is also defense minister israel s new president , ezer weizman , was mr rabin s deputy in 1967 his predecessor , chaim herzog , was also a career military man so are housing minister binyamin beneliezer and the heads of two rightist parties , rafael eitan and rehavam zeevi and there is the redoubtable ariel sharon , out of power now but always looking for a way back in in other democracies , a gathering of eagles and stars on this scale might set off worried talk about garrison states not in israel we 've had 45 years of experience for everyone to get used to it , said nahum barnea , a political commentator for the newspaper yediot ahronot we 've had no juntas there has always been crosspollination between the military and civilian spheres , especially since most israelis serve in the army , with men doing annual reserve duty into middle age one result , experts say , is a certain militarizing of civilian life and civilianizing of the army there s a very deep relationship between the two , and it cannot be any other way because we are involved in a long war , said yoram peri , chief editor of the newspaper davar and a specialist in the subject the military will continue to be a major channel into politics many eyes are now on general barak , who is reportedly being groomed by mr rabin for future labor party leadership when secretary of state warren christopher visited israel in february , general barak was on hand almost everywhere the american went after the muchdisputed deportation of 400 palestinians in december , an idea that originated with the general , it was he whom mr rabin designated to present the government s security arguments to the supreme court questions can arise about whether some senior officers act on military imperatives or think first how their decisions will look to voters i feel we can be quite confident that decisions are not influenced by political considerations , but no one can honestly say 100 percent that it never happens , said ephraim sneh , a labor member of parliament and a former west bank military commander such questions arose in november after five soldiers were killed by a misfired missile during a training exercise a week passed before it was disclosed that general barak and other top officers had been present the initial camouflaging of that fact touched off press assertions that the military censor had acted not to protect security interests as much as personal reputations on that score , specialists say it does not hurt to have former officers in parliament to keep an eye out they have their own sources in the army , said prof menachem hofnung of hebrew university , and so it winds up helping civilian control photo in israel these days , closeness between the military and politics is notable at the national level prime minister yitzhak rabin , right , army chief of staff in the 1967 war , relies on the military and political advice of the current chief , lieut gen ehud barak they stood together at a memorial day ceremony \( rina castelnuovo for the new york times \)
sterling , va it looks like any other brick colonial home in this washington suburb but for raymond w smith , chairman and chief executive of the bell atlantic corporation , it is both a dream house and a castle to be defended linked to the outside world by optical fibers , the unoccupied house was built recently by bell atlantic to show how a telephone company can deliver far more than talk in the kitchen , a person can point a clicker at a television screen to browse the specials at a local grocery store , order the week s food and specify a delivery time in the family room , the television is wired to instantly retrieve movies from a remote electronic library upstairs , children can order video games or study topics like the civil war by calling up documentaries stripped to its essence , however , mr smith s dream house is nothing less than a staging area in a multibilliondollar battle to determine which companies will provide the next generation of communications for the american home at stake is what bell atlantic and the nation s other local telephone companies see as their holy grail an allpurpose network that will deliver a flood of new services and produce a flood of new revenues but for the first time in their history , the phone companies face tough competition and big risks , and their identities will be shaped by how they respond even though no one knows how badly customers will want this communications cornucopia , a convergence of technologies is driving cable television companies and other rivals to provide the same kind of highway to the home the danger for the phone companies is that they will be left behind they do n't want to let the next stage of business growth pass them by , said peter d shapiro , a senior consultant in telecommunications at arthur d little inc in cambridge , mass it is more an aggressive move than a defensive move , but if they do n't do it , they fear that the major cable suppliers will get in there and lock them out but if any company can hold its own in this hightech , highstakes freeforall it is bell atlantic , one of the seven regional baby bells that emerged from the 1984 breakup of the american telephone telegraph company going head to head perhaps more than any of its siblings , bell atlantic under mr smith has moved to meet competitors head on based in philadelphia and operating from new jersey through virginia , it has upgraded its networks at a furious pace , rolled out dozens of new services like caller id and improved data communications to the home and begun a headlong plunge into the video marketplace that includes big plans to make available to every home in new jersey the same kinds of services available in its showcase house here we will be a fullservice company , mr smith said in a recent interview we have three information instruments in the home the telephone , the television and the computer and they are all coming together to communicate on a fullservice network the time is not far off when you will be answering your television set and watching your telephone just who will be transmitting the answers and images is far from clear , however indeed , the battle is part of a larger debate over efforts by the clinton administration to develop a nationwide information superhighway the government is already financing a highspeed network that would link supercomputers , but it is also trying to make the highway accessible to the public vice president gore has long argued that the phone companies should play a big role and he supports removing a key obstacle in their way a federal law that bars them from owning cable television systems in their areas the cable companies already operate networks that deliver dozens of television channels into more than 60 percent of the country s homes now they are boosting that capacity more than 10fold , and are introducing socalled switching technology to offer twoway communications the cable companies are also making a big push into wireless personal communication services lowpowered , inexpensive pocket phones and handheld computers that communicate over the air these services are expected to be authorized by the government within two years still other rivals are on the horizon longdistance companies are edging back into the local market by teaming up with cellular phone companies , as in the pending alliance between at t and mccaw cellular communications , and many experts predict similar alliances with cable companies and the cable companies have acquired many of the growing number of new fiberoptic carriers , which provide highspeed local communications services for big corporate customers finally , local phone companies are beginning to turn on each other just two weeks ago , the southwestern bell corporation said it would pay 650 million for two cable franchises outside washington , in bell atlantic s backyard because southwestern already owns a cellular telephone franchise in the washington area , the deal immediately raised the specter that southwestern would raid bell atlantic s territory by setting up a hybrid cabletelephone operation
wimbledon , england there was already a faint summervacation feel to the place since the squeals for barbra and andre died down on wednesday jimbo does n't come around any more junior is only a voice on the tube seles is still injured from that hideous stabbing tennis , even wimbledon , needs all the mystique it can get it still needs the old lady who waved a defiant forefinger in the air after being bluntly dispatched by jana novotna , 64 , 64 , in the semifinals yesterday in case any dullards missed the meaning of the forefinger , martina navratilova translated it into words that was , 'i 'll be back' she has another year to try to win her 10th singles title here , before martina ii is old enough to play wimbledon they are pounding at her in waves now , the young women from the country that used to be called czechoslovakia while the spry novotna was outserving and outvolleying the ninetime champion on center court , another martina , martina hingis , now from switzerland , was beating a player from the republic of georgia , nino luarsabishvili , 75 , 75 , in the junior girls' quarterfinals on an outside court hingis is onethird navratilova s age onethird has navratilova met the teenager who was named after her \? she s not a teenager she s 12 , navratilova replied with the sly smile she employs when she is smarter than everybody around her i saw a picture of her , navratilova added she looked 18 , but i think it s too soon hingis has proposed that she will not prod navratilova about being too old if navratilova will not say she is too young to venture onto the tour in two years but another czechborn player made the point yesterday with limber legs unbelievable , novotna said and no , she did n't see this as a battle of czech women it s just another match , and she is a great champion i just feel very happy that i 've beaten her today there is more to it none of the czechborn women has ever fallen down in awe of navratilova helena sukova s late mother , vera , was navratilova s coach and minder when navratilova defected , which surely kept helena and martina from becoming great pals novotna is twothirds of navratilova s 36 years twothirds when novotna was growing up in brno , the state television and newspaper rarely mentioned navratilova s name not much , novotna said , because that was the time she defected and all the news and everything about her was sort of , you know , not appearing on tv too much so i did n't know about her much i never met her in czechoslovakia in the czech and slovak segments of that splintered country , people are now free to watch these two women , who speak to each other in english , who are not exactly the best of friends novotna is coached by hana mandlikova , who used to delight in tormenting navratilova in big matches , and who liked to twit navratilova behind her back , too mandlikova has told her protegee to show no awe of anybody in the dressing room , particularly navratilova , who had beaten novotna all seven times , until yesterday this was the lesson nancy lieberman tried to impart to navratilova toward chris evert a decade ago , but navratilova never could totally freeze evert out novotna has iced navratilova on occasion these locker rooms are not that big mandlikova and novotna both wear rings on their ring fingers , which prompted a british reporter yesterday to ask if they were wedding rings i'm not married to anybody and i think it s none of anybody s business , novotna said , adding , it looks like a wedding ring , but it does n't necessarily mean i have to be married i answered this before can we stick to tennis questions \? by that time , the question and answer were already in the official press transcript navratilova has worn her heart on her sleeve for a long time yesterday her heart was on her tshirt it says , 'it happens in the best of families , ' said navratilova , this , the pink triangle \? no , it s a symbol of the gay movement , the upsidedown pink triangle since hitler marked gays in the concentration camps with a pink triangle , now it s the inverted pink triangle she was proud of the pink triangle , proud of herself she was glad to be alive and she was n't giving up next year it s going to be 37 , she said i'm not going to get any younger she went off to change from that tshirt to her tennis whites she was still in the mixed doubles but already , the old place felt slightly more empty photo martina navratilova vowing , i 'll be back \( reuters \)
mickey kantor , the us trade representative , declared the trade agreement announced by the industrialized countries in tokyo the biggest tariffcutting agreement in history not to be outdone , john major , the british prime minister , declared that the pact was infinitely bigger than anything we have seen before but the extravagant rhetoric owes more to the desperate need of leaders to boost their sagging popularity at home than to the modest accord itself none of the announced tariff cuts will take place unless the allimportant uruguay round of international trade talks is successfully completed and for that to take place , these leaders will have to summon far more courage than so far displayed all they did in tokyo was announce tariff cuts on manufactured goods that for the most part had already been offered meanwhile , they sidestepped controversies that have deadlocked the uruguay round had they failed to agree to cut tariffs on manufactured goods , the uruguay round which could add trillions to the world s output over the next decade would have been stillborn in that sense , the trade pact is important but it s only a small step in the right direction the trade agreement would largely eliminate tariffs on pharmaceuticals , medical equipment and seven other categories of manufactured products these acrosstheboard tariff cuts are welcomed because they will reduce consumer prices and therefore lift living standards around the world but the agreement did n't resolve tariff cuts on textiles and apparel , and other sectors where protectionist opposition has been ferocious the leaders did n't touch trade in the service industries or agriculture nor did they resolve important disputes such as washington s liberal use of sanctions to punish what it unilaterally regards as unfair trading practices by partners these are profound omissions if the us refuses to open its borders to foreign textiles , for example , the underdeveloped nations are n't likely to agree to honor copyrights and patents or open their markets to us exports of financial services and movies and if the us does n't win such access , congress is unlikely to approve the final agreement none of the leaders displayed much bravery this week mr clinton refused to take on the maritime or the textile and apparel industries which is understandable since he will need every southern democrat s vote he can get to push his economic package through congress but the same political calculus impelled the europeans to protect their electronics manufacturers and movie industries and japan to protect its farm sector , wood products and financial services cutting manufacturing tariffs was a necessary step toward an international trade agreement but it was also a modest step , and time is running out congress has given mr clinton until dec 15 to complete negotiations he and the other industrialized nations' leaders may leave tokyo smiling , but they still have to go back home and tackle strong protectionist forces only then will consumers reap the benefits that an international trade agreement will spread around the globe
newark , feb 12 the environmental protection agency cleared the way today for port officials to dredge some containership berths in newark bay , a task judged vital to the survival of waterfront commerce in new york harbor but the agency reserved decision on the full amount of dredging requested by the port authority of new york and new jersey until further testing determines if concentrations of dioxin in dredged sediment are low enough to permit it to be dumped in the ocean the agency also imposed other requirements , to assure that dioxincontaminated sediment does not migrate from the disposal site , an 80yearold mound called the mud dump about six miles east of sandy hook , nj and it asked that the army corps of engineers , which issues the permits upon recommendation of the epa , determine that the dumping will comply with the endangered species act 'time to analyze it' but the corps said it was not prepared to act immediately , having just received a detailed letter from william j muszynski , the epa s acting regional administrator , outlining the agency s findings we want to take the time to analyze it before we provide any guidance to the port authority , said a corps spokesman , peter shugert the announcement , coming late in the day before a holiday weekend , caught many interested parties by surprise and none were pleased with the recommendations it further delayed a resolution to an issue begun nearly three years ago , when the port sought a routine dredging permit last month the corps finally issued a permit , but the agency blocked it a week later , citing discrepancies over the amount to be dredged the agency has now recommended that 100 , 000 cubic yards be dredged in one portion of the terminal , half what the port originally requested but onefifth the amended request that the agency denied in january but it also warned that the dump site would be used up within seven years , and it proposed forming a study group to find alternatives to ocean disposal fear for business the dredging issue has polarized advocates for labor and environmental groups the port authority and shipping and longshore officials say the container terminal s 20billionayear business could be paralyzed by further delays in dredging berths accumulate six inches or more of silt a year , and the larger , more heavily laden vessels that call here may be forced to turn to deeper ports the agency s conditional approval is good for only 12 of the 29 berths that the port had sought to dredge there are a total of 62 in the marine terminal we are disappointed that today s letter from epa leaves this important issue still unresolved , said stanley brezenoff , the executive director of the port authority we are still unable to begin the dredging that the port needs so badly because the federal agencies involved have not brought this matter to closure we will have no further comment until we can complete a detailed analysis of the letter sarah l clark , a staff scientist for the environmental defense fund , and cindy zipf , executive director of clean ocean action , a new jersey coalition of fishermen , ecologists and business people , denounced the action for what it did as well as for what they felt it failed to do both said the agency should have required fresh testing on each of the three reaches , or berth areas , mentioned in the decision only one area was found by the agency to be acceptable but because of an increase in sediment buildup there over the last few years , the two environmentalists raised the need for more information about dioxin concentrations 'chance to comment' they both called for an environmental impact study of the dump site and for a cleanup of the passaic rivernewark bay area to prevent further leaking of dioxin we 're in disbelief that they expect us to believe that there s been no increase in volume in one area but an increase in two others , ms zipf said the public needs another chance to comment the port s frustration dates to the mid1980 s , when dioxin was discovered leaking from the passaic river site of a diamond shamrock plant , which manufactured the defoliant agent orange

vanilla crescents are some others that are popular these cookies all keep well , making it possible to bake them weeks in advance of serving or giving as gifts and now it is time to add italian biscotti to the list although the term biscotti simply means cookies in italy , a category that includes everything from fragile meringues to rich butter cookies and ladyfingers , in america it refers

much of the time everyone in this city seems to be moving toward some higher stage of development usually the process involves personal decisions , like taking courses , dieting , cutting hair or trying to live righteously sometimes , though , thresholds are crossed against our will consider what happened a few days ago at the toddler center at barnard college , where 12 children , between 18 and 30 months old , arrived with their mothers just as they had twice a week for the previous month this time the mothers , following instructions of the preschool s staff , mentioned on the elevator that they would not be staying to play as before , that they would be leaving to buy cookies at the entrance to the playroom , the mothers helped the toddlers hang their jackets in cubbies , then withdrew but instead of leaving they entered an adjoining room where , through a wallsized oneway mirror , they surreptitiously watched and shared their children s first significant experience of separation some barnard psychology majors were also in the blind so far so good , said one mother watching as her daughter took a book , pat the bunny , from a rack oh , oh , here we go , said another as her son started to cry some of the mothers made jokes , but none seemed truly at ease and things were getting tense on both sides of the mirror inside the playroom , whimpers turned into wails one child after another started to cry and headed for the area by the door through which the mothers had gone there , barring their way , sat pat shimm , the associate director , who has been through many separation days in the center s 20 years she hugged the crying children , read stories , sang songs and gave out multicolored stickers when one crying boy , named sijin , started to flail away , ms shimm gave him a doll to hit for the first hour none of that seemed to make much difference six of the toddlers spent long periods crying by the cubbies and six others played without tears but not necessarily without worry only one of the noncriers , a boy named steven , paid any attention to the criers several times he wandered to the cubbies and gave the crying children some of his colored stickers before going back to play with a toy bus five other teachers , including several barnard students , helped organize the play , bringing out a sandbox and paints on one table lay several jackinthebox toys that had been specifically chosen to symbolize the major lesson of the day and one of the major lessons of life things that go away can come back meanwhile , behind the oneway mirror , the mothers there were no fathers had also divided in two groups one , consisting of the mothers of the criers , congregated at the part of the mirror that looked into the cubby area someone in the observation room had called it the wailing wall all the mothers here were visibly pained but the most anguished was sijin s mother at times some of the other mothers tried to offer her solace , saying they were sure the boy in the tan overalls would soon stop crying but the woman , a recent immigrant from korea , spoke english poorly and it was not clear whether she understood what the other mothers were saying or whether she thought it condescending as her son kept crying , she stood rigidly by the door , never taking her eyes from him at times it seemed she was ready to bolt to join him in contrast , the mothers of the noncriers did not stand they sat in chairs and often complimented each other on how well their offspring coped with their disappearance but even there , anxieties were apparent my daughter has n't sniffled even once , commented one mother does that mean she does n't miss me \? is there something wrong with the way i 've bonded with her \? the mother was joking , or more precisely , she was more or less joking and then , close to two hours after the session began , the view through the mirror was suddenly transformed into something like a great day at the monkey house all the children had left the wailing wall indeed , all but sijin had stopped crying they were rushing all over the place , opening drawers , pulling out toys , examining corners , climbing on tables in a surging wave of energy one of the psychology majors explained that what was going on was a textbook case the children , having gained trust in the new surroundings , were setting out to explore they had moved a little bit away from the old and familiar and were realizing the possibilities of the new at that point , sijin s mother entered the playroom his tears vanished when he saw her , and while she sat quietly in a corner he started to play actively a halfhour later all the other mothers came back with the cookies they had promised there were hugs and kisses and everybody went home it had been a pretty rough day at school , but as so many people keep saying , no pain , no gain
now that millions of working men and women are guaranteed 12 weeks of unpaid , jobprotected leave for the birth of a child under the family and medical leave act , which took effect aug 5 , will america begin to see new fathers staying at home \? is dad more likely to be around the house in the first few months , taking the newborn out in the baby carriage while mom gets a chance to nap or read \? it sounds nice the image conforms to our collective notion that men are more sensitive to the needs of women and more interested in children than they used to be but the answer , mostly , is no at least not any time soon one reason , of course , is that new fathers need their paychecks but i'm betting that even men who can afford to take off two or three months generally wo n't do it , because extended paternity leave is not yet inwardly acceptable to most of them in large part this has to do with the culture of the workplace even though parental leave is now law , i doubt that the nation s bosses have changed their opinions much since a 1986 survey cited by the washington post earlier this month when chief executives and human resources directors at 1 , 500 of the nation s largest companies were asked what a reasonable length of time would be for paternity leave , 63 percent of those who responded said none why \? part of the reason is that fatherstobe are perceived differently from their pregnant wives in the workplace , pregnant women go through a visible progression the firsttrimester morning sickness , the growing belly , the swollen ankles pregnant women are affectionately touched by coworkers and given heaps of advice it s different for expectant fathers our coworkers ask about our wives , mostly , and the talk between men tends to run with much solemnity to insurance coverage and what to do if one s wife , laboring in great pain , does n't want the epidural anesthetic although i work in a reasonably progressive office , four years ago , as the birth of our first child neared , no one in authority came to me and said , we hope you 'll feel comfortable taking a few weeks off i asked about a paternal leave policy there was none so i arranged to take two weeks of vacation it was a good thing i did , because our daughter ended up back in the hospital twice in the first 10 days of her life when we had our second child i was in a better position to argue for a formal , unpaid leave , and had i asked i would probably have been granted it but i did n't ask in fact , two days after our son was born , i slipped back into the office to look at the mail and soon resumed fulltime work the fact is , men s roles have changed less than we think if anything , there is greater pressure now on men the culture rightly asks that we be supportive husbands and devoted fathers but we are also working in an economy in which it is increasingly difficult for a father alone to support a family , even temporarily also , few men are secure in their careers when they become fathers even if we can afford a long leave , we sense we 'd better get back to the job and we may have seen our wives agonize about what will become of their careers by taking a leave men may not like this state of affairs , but it s so built into our understanding of things that we do n't protest although i'm now a father twice over , i'm afraid i would secretly look upon a male coworker who took a long paternal leave as someone who was less serious about his work i'm not proud of this feeling , but there it is on the other hand , i 'd cheer his independence and hope more men would someday follow him finally , there is another reason new fathers go back to work soon after the birth , a selfish motive we might as well acknowledge after having dutifully puffed and panted through natural childbirth classes and then sweated out the actual delivery , suddenly being cooped up at home with a squalling , mysterious infant and a tired , distracted wife is n't necessarily the transcendent joy it s advertised to be and maybe her mother , or ours , is around , helping out , fussing , looking for the sugar in the wrong kitchen cabinet the prospect of immersion in this environment is , for some men , a panicky proposition the office , even with its pressures , suddenly seems sweetly attractive , affording a regular pattern , a known role returning to work , we should admit , can be a guilty but genuine relief drawing
the dinkins administration reached an agreement yesterday with the sanitation workers union to give workers at least onethird of any money saved through longer trashpickup routes and other measures to increase productivity the accord marked the first time that mayor david n dinkins , who has said for three years that he would like to make city workers more efficient by promising them a share of savings , has been able to find a common ground with a municipal union on such a plan but city hall and the union must still agree on exactly how work rules will be changed to achieve the savings , which city officials hope will amount to more than 20 million a year the agreement yesterday had its roots in a contract settlement between the city and the uniformed sanitationmen s association nearly 11 months ago that pact granted 6 , 800 sanitation workers a 35 percent raise but left unresolved the question of lengthening routes , requiring both sides to negotiate changes in routes and , if they could not agree , to submit the issue to an arbitrator agreement with coalition that process became a model for an agreement the city reached two weeks ago with a coalition of unions representing about 180 , 000 civilian city workers in that settlement , the city and the unions promised to negotiate six workrule changes none as yet spelled out by june and let an arbitrator resolve disputes mr dinkins has drawn fire from fiscal experts for agreeing to wage increases before getting solid commitments from unions to increase productivity the agreement reached yesterday lends mr dinkins s approach credibility , officials said i think it s an important step forward , first deputy mayor norman steisel said , adding that it at least gives life to the approach we want to take the main sticking point in talks with the sanitation workers union over the last year has been how to split the savings from longer routes and how to reckon the amount of money saved , officials said city officials have been fighting to extend some garbage routes because , as new yorkers have begun recycling garbage , the workload for workers in some of the city s 59 sanitation districts has dropped steeply , allowing workers in some instances to finish their eighthour shifts in as little as four hours but the two sides could not agree on how to share savings and , after months of boggeddown talks , they submitted the question to a mediator , who issued a nonbinding opinion that both sides accepted yesterday a model program the mediator , alan r viani , recommended that a third of the money saved through longer routes be divided among the workers in each sanitation district if the annual savings exceed 20 million , the workers' share would rise to 37 percent he also suggested that the savings should be figured on how many trucks are eliminated about 120 , 000 per truck in addition , mr viani proposed that the city and the union establish a model program in one district within a month and work to revamp the routes in the rest of the city within a year mr dinkins said the agreement makes it possible to iron out route changes with workers in individual districts because the workers will be able to gauge precisely how much more money they can earn by taking on extra work the bonuses workers receive will vary widely from district to district because the route lengths , the amount of garbage and the amounts recycled differ greatly , he said the union has not yet decided whether the bonuses from the savings will go only to the 3 , 000 workers who collect trash , or to all 6 , 800 sanitation workers , including street cleaners , recycling workers and others depending on how the money is distributed , the extra earnings for each worker could run , on average , from 1 , 000 to 2 , 300 a year after five years on the job , sanitation workers earn a maximum of 36 , 876 a year , so the bonus would represent a raise of between 3 and 6 percent mr viani s decision provides labor and management with the tools and incentives to get sanitation workers back to a full day s work , the mayor said the sanitation commissioner , emily lloyd , estimated that the city can save about 20 million through lengthening routes she said that with the cooperation of the union , the city can handle the 11 , 000 tons of garbage it collects daily with 200 fewer trucks , a 20 percent decrease a spokesman for the union , james grossman , said that while the agreement on how to share savings breaks down the main obstacle to putting workrule changes into effect , the two sides still have a long way to go each route change will have to be negotiated separately , he said , and the union can always submit disputes to an arbitrator among the unresolved issues , he said , are how to relocate workers whose routes are eliminated and how much more work each employee will have to shoulder there are some very difficult days ahead , he said there are a lot of difficult issues to resolve as with any productivity program , there is a host of things that might come up , things that we do n't even think about right now the president of the union , peter scarlatos , said in a prepared statement that the union would try hard to implement longer routes he pointed out that in the early 1980 s the union reached an agreement with the city to move to twoworker garbage trucks instead of threeworker crews , a change that saved the city about 50 million a year this union made the twoman truck program work , and we 'll make recycling work as long as the department recognizes it takes two to make a successful agreement , he said the city s labor commissioner , james f hanley , played down the notion that the agreement with garbage haulers would set a benchmark for talks with other municipal unions about productivity programs every one will be bargained on its own merits , he said but some union leaders disagreed arthur cheliotes , the president of local 1180 of the communications workers of america , one of the unions that reached an agreement with the city two weeks ago , said the 33 percent share of savings for workers would become a starting place for negotiations with the city on other productivity programs it certainly is a benchmark , he said and , of course , as an advocate for my side , i would look at it as a floor anything less is

maybe it s time to start taking the playwright nicky silver seriously up to now , his bizarrely titled works fat men in skirts , free will and wanton lust , my marriage to ernest borgnine have been characterized by their outrageousness , a lunatic humor , sexual confusions , violence and an eagerness , bordering on the sophomoric , to flout taboos pterodactyls , his latest play \( off broadway at the vineyard theater \) , runs true to form , but there s something new to the mix a strange and compelling sadness with characteristic flamboyance , he rips into the duncans , a philadelphia main line family , and reveals them in all their sodden , neurotic glory but he also finds it in himself to pity them compassion , i think , becomes him it makes him a better playwright the duncans and by extension , the human race are going the way of the dinosaurs , dying out from aids , alcoholism and the emotional chill in the air once this chaotic , but sharpedged comedy has run its course , even the duncans' topiary garden is in the grip of a new ice age in many ways , pterodactyls struck me as the flip side of the skin of our teeth , thornton wilder s antic celebration of mankind s ability to muddle through marveling , instead , at our capacity for selfdestruction , mr silver seems periodically stunned that we have made it as far as we have at the outset , todd duncan \( t scott cunningham \) , the prodigal son , gives us an overview of the planet s history , so you 'll have some perspective he s mislaid his notes , however , so the lecture proves a bit topsyturvy one day , he explains , the monkeys stood up , erect , realized they had opposing thumbs and developed speech thus , mankind was born some people liked africa , so they stayed there and became black some people left , looking for something , and became europeans and the europeans made countries and queen elizabeth executed her own halfsister , mary queen of scots marco polo , the telephone , rose kennedy and citizen kane also mark major leaps forward the long , loopy march of time leads directly to the duncans , dysfunctional standins for wilder s indomitable antrobus family , and they 're about to have the oriental carpet pulled from under them todd has contracted aids and returned home , seeking shelter and comfort , although ironically he will hold out the longest against the descending night his sister , emma \( hope davis \) , is engaged to be married , but her mind is like swiss cheese , her hearing selective , and her tight , white skin several sizes too small for her body , or so she insists , with a terrible wriggle that suggests she is trying to shed a straitjacket and a pair of panty hose at the same time a friend of mine described ms davis as looking like the love child of peewee herman and meryl streep , and frankly i can do no better i would add , however , that her eyes perfectly match the polka dots on her firstact frock , and that the actress is hilarious whether she s experiencing an attack of anxiety or a sudden onslaught of amnesia it does n't help her mental health , i suppose , that her fiance , tommy \( kent lanier \) , has been asked to fill in for the maid , who has just quit , and that he cottons instantly to the black dress , white apron and feather duster later , he even cottons to todd the flushfaced , backclapping father \( dennis creaghan \) , a prosperous banker , is good mostly for paying the bills until he loses his job then he s as furious and discombobulated as everyone else fury and discombobulation are , in fact , the raw materials of this play none of the characters is that many steps removed from madness , which they prefer to view as a form of gregariousness grace \( kelly bishop \) , the matriarch of the clan , can be termed a leveling influence only in the sense that a bulldozer is nipping regularly at the booze , acknowledging life to the extent that it resembles a fancy sitdown dinner , talking at , around and above \( but never to \) the other family members , she moves through pterodactyls like a designer whirlwind if ms bishop has been searching for a stage role to make us forget she played the acerbic sheila in a chorus line , she s landed it her transformation in the second act into a bloated helpless drunk is so persuasive it s scary her eyes go out , her flesh begins to resemble old puff pastry , while her overbearing will shrinks to a slur and a whimper mr silver is a latterday absurdist , and he writes with a lot of zest the shortcomings of his plays are those of absurdism itself , which pretty much extends a playwright carte blanche when human beings are viewed as a mass of contradictory , meaningless impulses , any aboutface is permitted , however illogical logic itself is suspect so is language , which is boobytrapped and rarely allows a person to say what he means anything goes in a world that has lost its bearings and does n't know how to find them where does a playwright draw the line \? what keeps him from going overboard just for the sake of going overboard \?
washington , aug 3 frank r lautenberg of new jersey has rarely taken center stage in the united states senate but he put himself squarely there today by announcing that he would again vote against president clinton s deficitreduction plan mr lautenberg s announcement came in a spare , eightline press release that called the budget plan unfair to the middle class although he has long been identified as a loyal , if not predictable liberal democrat , his decision came as no surprise what was surprising was that the white house did not fight harder for his vote after all , the new jersey senator is running for reelection next year in a state still reeling from a 1990 revolt against state tax increases that almost brought down senator bill bradley wincing at criticism senate democratic leaders wrote mr lautenberg off days ago , if not weeks ago , and they are still wincing at his harsh criticism of the president s plan when it first squeaked through the senate in june mr lautenberg was one of six democrats to vote with the republicans against the president then , forcing vice president al gore to cast a tiebreaking vote now that senator david l boren of oklahoma has joined the ranks of democratic opponents , the administration is looking for a way to persuade one of the original democrats who voted against the plan to change his mind today s announcement closed the door to any possibility that mr lautenberg would be the one to help the president on the most crucial vote the democratic party has faced in years as for mr lautenberg , he called his decision today a biggie , but no more fateful than his votes opposing the use of military force in the persian gulf or in favor of the 1990 budget agreement 'laborious' decision i came to this decision very laboriously , he said i had calls from the white house i sat with the president i hate to vote against the president s program , but i do n't consider this a disloyal act it s unpleasant because we have gotten calls that number in the thousands some are threats , like 'i 'll never vote for you again' the new jerseyan described the pressure he came under from the administration as modest , mostly coming in the form of encouraging his local supporters to write and call him there were no lastminute white house threats to encourage a primary opponent and no hardnosed calls to mr lautenberg s contributors or political consultants none of the things past administrations have done when the time came to shove all their chips into the pot but the administration played a little hardball two weeks ago , when president clinton and other senior officials gave an exclusive briefing to new york and new jersey reporters stressing the benefits of the budget plan for the metropolitan area facing the electorate obviously referring to mr lautenberg and other recalcitrant democrats , lloyd bentsen , the treasury secretary , said how do you think they would like to go back to the electorate if this thing fails and has their name on that \? to have seen interest rates start to go up again and the stock market start to go down \? the electorate would hold them responsible for that the officials went on to say that the budget plan , if passed , would bring new jersey 96 , 000 jobs by 1996 mr lautenberg privately complained to the white house that he did not appreciate the thinly veiled slam at his election prospects and today , he questioned their job figures , but politely i'm not sure they have a basis for their projection my mission here is not primarily to support the president , he said if the bill goes down , another bill will be written ribbing from other senators among the unpleasant consequences of his stance is the critical whispering among senate democrats who think mr lautenberg s opposition reflects more devotion to his own political interests than to those of the president or their party acknowledging the heat from his colleagues , mr lautenberg said 'do n't you see this as good for the country \? ' they ask and i say 'no , you 're wrong you need more deficit reduction' the senate is usually a genteel , subdued place , like an exclusive club and as a selfmade millionaire among millionaires , the 69yearold senator normally glides through his workday with little fanfare but in the minutes after his announcement , his colleagues made him the center of attention , giving him a relentless ribbing as he commuted from the senate floor to his office in the hart building on the senate subway in an elevator , senator richard c shelby of alabama , perhaps the most hardline democratic opponent to the clinton economic program , slapped mr lautenberg on the back and said , they say you 're leaning straight up ! senator john glenn of ohio , a clinton supporter , chimed in frank says some of my people are for it , and some of my people are against it , and i'm for my people in a separate interview , mr bradley said that while he disagreed with mr lautenberg , as a colleague , you have to respect another person s decision he added that it was hard to tell whether mr lautenberg s vote would hurt or help his reelection bid 'new jersey first'
los angeles if there is anything to be said of los angeles in the last decade , it is that it has become consistently and continuously more citylike , in both the good and bad senses of that word it is a more urban place than it once was , denser and tenser and busier than ever its citizens are less inclined to fool themselves into believing that escape brings freedom from the woes that afflict other cities , less willing to pretend that los angeles is as different from other cities as they once thought it s against this background of growing urban consciousness that the city s decision to spend 214 million on a library in the middle of its downtown has to be viewed this library is not only a place of books but a statement about urbanism , a statement about los angeles s increasing willingness to let itself be like other , older cities designed by hardy holzman pfeiffer associates , a new york and los angeles firm with what could be called a highly urban sensibility , the project almost did n't happen at all that it not only got built but turned out as well as it did is a triumphant moment for both the city s architecture and its history the building s saga is a story of politics , economics , sociology and symbolism architecture would seem almost to be the least of it , though in the end it may be the thing that brings the most pleasure for this is more than an excellent new building it is also a magnificently restored older one the real beginning of the story is not in 1983 , when hardy holzman pfeiffer was hired , but back in the 1920 s , when the city of los angeles , eager for a sign that it had reached urban maturity , commissioned the new york architect bertram grosvenor goodhue to design a large central library on a prominent downtown site goodhue produced a magnificent mix of spanish colonial , byzantine and art moderne architecture that quickly became a landmark , the los angeles equivalent of the great libraries of new york and boston all was well until the 1970 s , when the goodhue building s age and limited size led to cries for its replacement preservationists , who correctly saw the building as a masterwork by one of the 20th century s important architects , fought fiercely with librarians , who wanted more space and efficiency both groups were pitted against politicians , who questioned whether a sprawling city like los angeles needed a central library at all why not scatter the collection throughout the city , they asked , on the rationale that pro library voters lived in residential neighborhoods , not downtown office towers making the same argument , but for an altogether different reason , were the celebrants of technology , who thought that computer terminals everywhere were the way to bring los angeles into the new era of library science the city debated for years but finally resolved the issue in the right way , by deciding to save the goodhue library , restore it and expand it in 1986 a devastating fire in the goodhue building set the effort back and stretched out the timetable to a full decade from the hiring of the architect to the cutting of the ribbon last week the results are worth it the goodhue building has been exquisitely restored , and joined to a large new structure beside it that now contains most of the library s stacks and reading rooms while the two sections do not flow together seamlessly either inside or out we always know whether we are in the new or the old wing , which is as it should be the goodhue and hardy holzman pfeiffer buildings sit together comfortably , even amicably it s no small accomplishment , since the goodhue building was designed to stand entirely alone with a floor plan shaped like a cross , four major entrances and a brilliantly colored pyramidal tower as a central exclamation point , this is not a building that wants any competition norman pfeiffer , the architect in charge of the project , has managed to create an addition that both defers to goodhue and stands strongly on its own the new structure is slightly whimsical , slightly institutional , its style a kind of decorated industrial modernism that picks up on the art moderne leanings of the goodhue building it is covered in a combination of adobecolored stucco and green terra cotta , and its carefully sculptured setbacks mount upward in a way that relates to the shape of the goodhue building without directly imitating it the addition is anchored by an eightstory atrium , roughly half of which is set below ground to keep the profile of the new building low and allow the tower of the original building to keep pride of place on the skyline the atrium is full of natural light , and it has no feeling of being underground escalators tumble down through the space like a waterfall on both sides of the atrium at each level are reading rooms and stacks , decorated in hardy holzman pfeiffer s characteristic mix of funkiness , retrochic and industrial modernism the rooms are comfortable and inviting none of the spaces in the new wing come up to goodhue s best , however , which stands as a reminder of how unthinkable it would have been to lose the old building , truly one of the treasures of american architecture the central rotunda , still the emotional if no longer the functional heart of the building , is handsomely restored as a ceremonial hall , while the original reading rooms , with their lush murals and extraordinary stenciling , have been converted into the new children s department that decision makes a glorious statement what better way to introduce children to the pleasures of both reading and architecture \? but this whole complex is likely to do that for everyone in los angeles the building is a central symbol for a city that has so few of them , for a city that has often had to concede that freeways are its logo is such a library an anachronism in an age of computers and faxes , an age that deals in information retrieval more than book collecting \? it may be that we need this sort of library more than ever , in los angeles and everywhere else this library is a research center , but it is also a community center where knowledge is the lure , a place where the people of this increasingly multiethnic city can meet on common ground it reminds us that sprawling out forever does n't work that los angeles cannot think of itself as 474 square miles and growing , that it must turn back inward if it is to survive and in a city of private realms , this project celebrates what los angeles needs most

to the editor aids and a dentist s secrets \( the week in review , june 6 \) states that some are asking whether the cluster of cases of human immunodeficiency virus \( the virus that causes aids \) transmitted from a dentist in florida to six patients should not be considered murder i was medical counsel to kimberly bergalis and am medical counsel to sherry johnson , the sixth patient infected from dr david j acer i have been as intimately involved with these cases as anyone , and believe that attempts to solve this mystery with a murder theory fly in the face of what is known about infectious diseases and bloodborn viruses the medical facts are these four studies following the patients of 57 hivpositive health care workers showed none of the 19 , 000 patients to be infected however there are about 50 , 000 hivinfected health care workers who have not volunteered for studies to determine if their patients were infected , and no significant resources from state or federal sources have been sought to go beyond the insignificant number of epidemiologically flawed studies carried out so far more than half the patients in the studies were never traced , and in many cases the health care workers had died , with none having blood available for dna matching of doctor to patient as in the acer study in virtually all of the studies you mention , hiv cases in patients who had other risk factors , such as promiscuous sex or intravenous drug abuse were thrown out of the study , thus eliminating the possibility that the hivinfected invasive health care worker was in fact the risk factor in transmission according to the centers for disease control and the occupational safety and health agency , more than 60 health care workers have been infected with hiv from patients during invasive surgical procedures it should not be surprising therefore that blood is a twoway street and transmission can occur from doctor to patient , as in the acer case , as well as from patient to doctor the paradigm of another bloodbornedisease , hepatitis b , teaches us that chronically infected invasive health care workers with hepatitis b who do not transmit the virus for years may suddenly transform themselves into transmitters of this disease to clusters of patients , just as dr acer did before invoking murder to whitewash this mystery , and therefore to relieve the hivinfected invasive health care worker from scrutiny , traditional and modern investigative epidemiological tools must be used to prove or disprove that the dr acer mystery is not just the tip of the iceberg with regard to hiv transmission in the invasive health care setting sanford f kuvin , md palm beach , fla , june 11 , 1993

the conversations were invariably the same restaurant critic we 're going to fourteen guest diner what s that \? rc the old quatorze gd it s still there \? rc yes well , no it s the same place , same owners , new menu and new chef the notice that quatorze had become restaurant fourteen stirred memories in 1984 , long before bistromania , which appears to be fading fast , grasped new york in its clutches , quatorze was packing them in down on 14th street , where its shiny red door stood like a beacon on a seedylooking stretch six years later , in 1990 , the owners opened quatorze bis on east 79th street while it continues to draw crowds for nightly bistrobrasserie fare , the orignal quatorze has not been so lucky for three years , 14th street was torn up the promised gentrification of the strip between seventh and eighth avenues never happened competition from newer bistros provided fresher and more uptodate food in more convenient locations quatorze was on its way to wherever tired old restaurants go the owners , mark digiulio and peter meltzer , were n't willing to give up so easily , and did what other failing restaurants have done with mixed results they changed the menu , the chef and the name of the restaurant poof ! quatorze became fourteen , a contemporary american restaurant with lighter food the neighbors , who make up the core clientele , were not happy , demanding a return of the old roast chicken with pommes frites , calf s liver and caramelized apple tart with paperthin crust poof ! fourteen became an american bistro the chef , unwilling to make changes , moved on the more amenable souschef took over and some of those old dishes have returned all within six weeks the crowds cannot be far behind fourteen is as good as it was in its heyday , and the food , no longer the rich traditional fare of the classic bistro , might even make its way onto the surgeon general s list well , some of it better still , all main courses with the exception of the huge , juicy , meaty , perfectly cooked black angus sirloin with the restaurant s justly famous pommes frites are 14 the steak is 23 old fans will recognize their surroundings nothing has changed , though tirez has been removed from the front door \( it has not been replaced by a sign saying pull \) through the red door , past the marbletopped bar and oldfashioned tiled floor to the simply lighted dining room with its rubyred banquettes , spotless white tablecloths , old french posters and prints everything is familiar the long , yellow , traditonal brasserie menu has been replaced by a more conventional one , but you will still find the fabulously fresh and briny oysters listed , served with a slightly too piquant mignonette sauce the wonderfully garlicky sausages come on a bed of robust white beans , homey codfish cakes are accompanied by zesty corn relish , and a wellseasoned salad of mixed greens can be had with or without grilled goat cheese the smoked mozzarella with excellent tomatoes was also good , but the surprise hit was a warm and cozy duck confit salad two soup specials celery and carrot were good , but the regular appetizers are much better and more interesting no matter what your maincourse choice , the portions are large and generally nicely done , whether it s slightly pink pork medallions on a delicious puree of potatoes and parsnips topped with deepfried slivers of parsnips warm , mediumrare salmon on a bed of greens flavored with a citrus dressing a nicely grilled vegetable plate seasoned with a superior olive oil , or tender pink calf s liver arranged after the fashion of a nouvelle cuisine dish on a bed of onion puree with tracings of reduced balsamic vinegar and chive oil the flank steak was well cooked but tough , its accompanying ratatouille fresh and herbaceous the trout with mustard greens would have been an excellent pointcounterpoint , but the trout was bland and dry the white meat of the roast chicken was a trifle dry , too the dark meat was perfect two specials one evening , duck rigatoni and monkfish , were disappointing , the latter tasteless , the former a combination that never came together from the original menu , the only real disappointment is the hot apple tart the chef does n't have the crust right the original was beautifully caramelized all over this one is more austere and less tempting what is now being called chocolate terrine is suspiciously similar to the old chocolate regal it was once described at the restaurant as not a cake , not a pudding , not a mousse and not a truffle , but like one yes and be sure to balance its richness with plenty of the whipped cream that is served with the apple tart but is better with the chocolate whatever creme caramel is as smooth as it ought to be but it needs to be silkier and have more caramel sauce for the surgeon general , there is lovely fresh fruit salad one last cavil with so much superior bread available , the restaurant should change its supplier but it should keep its wine list just as it is short and sweet , with good choices at reasonable prices the service was excellent , and even though i am known at the restaurant , it seemed to be equally professional at all the tables , whether the diners were men in business suits or boys in cutoffs , a group of women in a celebratory mood or a mother whose

uniondale , li , may 22 facing elimination before a supportive home crowd , the islanders stayed alive in the stanley cup playoffs tonight , coming from behind to take a 41 victory over the montreal canadiens at nassau coliseum the victory was the islanders' first in the wales conference finals , which montreal leads by three games to one game 5 will be monday night in montreal the winner of this series plays either los angeles or toronto in the stanley cup final the loss by montreal ended its postseason winning streak at 11 games , which tied the national hockey league record set last spring by both pittsburgh and chicago only two teams in nhl history have won a sevengame series after falling behind by three games to none they were the 1942 toronto maple leafs , over detroit , and the 1975 islanders , over pittsburgh 23 saves for healy steve thomas , patrick flatley , david volek and benoit hogue scored for the islanders glenn healy made 23 saves playing a commanding role for the islanders was uwe krupp , the big defenseman from germany , who moved into an attacking role after vladimir malakhov left the game with a knee injury krupp assisted on the goals by thomas and volek and almost scored himself with a jam from the short side on roy late in the game i was in the right spot at the right time , krupp said i figured , 'i guess i'm in here' despite montreal s lead in the series , krupp said , it has been a very even series because the islanders have lost twice in overtime hopefully , we wo n't run out of time , krupp said i like playing against montreal a negative aspect to the victory involved injuries to malakhov and to ray ferraro malakhov played only briefly after his knee injury ferraro left the game near the end of the third period after he was hit in the head by the stick of lyle odelein , a montreal defenseman who has harassed the islanders all series with rough tactics al arbour , the islander coach , said both men are questionable for the next game malakhov is new york s top attacking defenseman , and ferraro leads all playoff scorers with 13 goals takes the fifth arbour , harshly critical of officiating in this series , was asked if odelein should have been penalized i refuse to answer on the grounds that i may incriminate myself , arbour said the game was scoreless after one period and was tied at 11 after two paul dipietro gave montreal a 10 lead at 6 minutes 22 seconds of the second period when he beat healy on a rebound steve thomas tied it for the islanders at 13 14 when , after losing his helmet , he took a pass from uwe krupp , wheeled to the front of the net from the left of patrick roy and beat the goalie with a rising wrist shot on the short side a scoring spree flatley gave the islanders a 21 lead at 5 57 of the third when he won a battle for the puck in the islander end , skated it up through the neutral zone and passed to ferraro on the right boards ferraro threw a long pass to the slot , where flatley took it and beat roy with a short shot david volek then made it 31 when he tapped a loose puck at the edge of the crease past roy at 10 24 hogue wrapped it up with an emptynet goal , his fifth of the playoffs , at 19 16 to complete a threegoal period the islanders lost malakhov early in the first period when he injured a knee in a collision with gilbert dionne behind the net malakhov was going back to touch the puck for icing , and just as he reached the puck , dionne slammed into him and put him into the backboards rule change needed the situation on which he was hurt is common in the league and it creates many needless injuries and dangerous collisions eight days ago , in the first period of game 7 of the islanderspittsburgh series , penguins star kevin stevens did a similar thing to rich pilon when the islander defenseman was about to touch the puck it was stevens who got the worst of the collision , suffering a broken nose and leaving the ice on a stretcher while arena workers mopped up a pool of his blood such plays do n't occur in college hockey or european hockey because icing is called the moment the puck crosses the end line the linesmen do n't wait for a player on the opposing team to touch it a change in this rule by the nhl has been a frequent subject of discussion best early chance on tonight s play , dionne got a twominute penalty for charging , although the referee , dan marouelli , did n't appear poised to call it until it was obvious that malakhov was injured ferraro had the best chance of the first period but hit the blade of roy s stick with roy sprawled across the crease denis savard had montreal s best chance , on an oddman rush , but healy beat him with the glove on what the goalie termed the best save i made in the series in the other series , the maple leafs trail the los angeles kings by two games to one slap shots tom kurvers was out of the lineup , replaced on the islanders' defense by jeff norton the islanders are 2511

in the snappy , brightly lighted world of primetime television , david burke admits that his new series , tribeca , stands out like a pedestrian on the ventura freeway that may be because any attempt to produce serious drama on television these days is regarded as the act of a lone nut who is thumbing his nose at network executives or as a death wish , because the chances of the program s surviving are next to none but mr burke , who is an executive producer of the show and its creator , is a stubborn man his transgressions of the laws of television begin with the fact that the concept of tribeca cannot be summed up in three words or less the series can best be described as an anthology of six onehour episodes \( an antiquated form \) with only two recurring roles \( ratings disaster \) , which is shot entirely in new york \( too expensive \) and features an eclectic array of characters , including a homeless veteran , a horse named kerouac and an uppermiddleclass black banker who does not speak the rimshot jive of the black characters in most sitcoms \( kiss of death \) one week tribeca is the darkest of dramas the next week , inexplicably , it might be a light romantic comedy it came as no shock , mr burke says , when the three biggest networks each decided to pass on the project they stared at me like i was out of my mind , he says they were some of the blankest looks i have ever seen if not for robert de niro , whose tribeca production company backed mr burke financially and lent him considerable prestige , the series probably never would have been made mr burke was working on a movie project with mr de niro when the notion for the series was developed , but even with the movie star s imprimatur , it was getting nowhere in the end , fox , which until recently has concentrated on teenage fare , decided that tribeca was worth the risk and put it on tuesdays at 9 fox said they were in the business of being different , mr burke recalls and at the very least , it would bring them a modicum of respectability the first of the six programs was shown on march 23 while fox says tribeca is outperforming the show it replaced \( key west \) , it is waiting to see how the remaining episodes perform we are very proud of this show creatively , says sandy grushow , president of fox entertainment but we are in the business of generating ratings we are not in the prestige business for mr burke , who is 44 , tribeca represented a chance to try something new that was also , in a sense , something old a dialoguedriven drama that he hoped would evoke the venerable television dramas produced in new york in the 1950 s he had spent seven years in los angeles laboring on two critically acclaimed cop shows , crime story and wiseguy it would have been so simple to do another vicious urban drama , he says inarticulate rage is easy you have a guy grab his crotch , pull a gun , and shoot what is much more difficult , and infinitely more satisfying , is to have a guy full of rage express himself when it comes to his scripts , mr burke can be as confrontational as his characters david feels passionately about his point of view and fights hard for it , says peter roth , an old friend and president of production at 20th television some people find it difficult to take , but i find it refreshing digging into a plate of huevos rancheros at bubbie s , the hudson street restaurant that was the inspiration for zadie s , the \( much bigger \) neighborhood hangout in tribeca , mr burke admits that the idea for the anthology was really just a way to get back east not to the streets of new york , which he saw for the first time at age 17 , but to the studio television community he remembers from his youth , when he tagged along after his two showbusiness parents his mother , who then called herself cathey hayes , was host of a local shopathome show in charlotte , nc , in the early 1950 s his father , a producer , was the acerbic new york radio and television talkshow personality alan burke i was born into television , he says , recalling how his parents would leave him in the control booth from the age of 5 it was very much home to me he can still describe favorite scenes from old studio dramas like playhouse 90 , with which tribeca has been repeatedly compared by critics , and philco playhouse he reveres the work of paddy chayefsky , whose distinctive teleplays like marty were better , he felt , than most movies talking about rod serling s twilight zone , this cantankerous producer almost waxes nostalgic now there s someone who did well without doing too much pandering , he says mr de niro , the executive producer with jane rosenthal and mr burke , has been closely involved with tribeca at every stage , reading scripts , making casting suggestions , and looking at dailies his commitment to the show , which , according to ms rosenthal , extends to calling her at the crack of dawn for its ratings , has apparently not altered his usual reluctance to talk to reporters after repeated requests for an interview , mr de niro had an assistant telephone a terse reply to several questions that had been presented to him in writing david is a very talented writer , the statement said , and has a track record in tv
i faced a terrible dilemma when i came home from vacation i wanted to go to a baseball game but i did n't know where to turn baseball is getting so scary when the mets were home , i heard about players aiming explosives and bleach sprays at reporters , and i could n't find the old hard hat and construction goggles i used to carry in the trunk of my car when i was a news reporter covering coalmine explosions and urban violence now that the yankees are home , i hear snide whispers about yankee stadium being in an unsafe neighborhood a blustering bully is menacing the bronx , threatening to stuff its most precious commodity in his gunnysack and sneak out of town well , we 've seen that before in this town instead of seeking out the yankees and the mets , i went looking for another baseball team , the team of my childhood , the team now vaguely remembered only for the good times i went looking for the brooklyn dodgers i drove with my adult son into flatbush , turned onto bedford avenue and saw the ebbets field apartments , looming dozens of stories into the air right field , i said this is where dixie walker hit a home run the first game i ever saw we drove around the apartments , and i pointed out where the rotunda was behind home plate , the clubhouse exit where you waited for autographs i told my son about the time i met jackie robinson at a hotdog stand , while he was sitting out a game with an injury all the memories came hot and heavy about a ball club that used to play on this block nearly 36 years later , while discussing the man who took the dodgers out of brooklyn , i found myself cursing out loud , in frustration i blamed walter o'malley for the potholes in the streets of brooklyn i blamed him for the burnedout buildings i blamed him for the graffiti actually , chunks of brooklyn looked pretty good in bay ridge , there were handsome brownstones , wellkept private homes , neat little restaurants , people standing around on corners it reminded me of the 50 s city life going on despite o'malley one sign of life was a clean , welllighted place named the brooklyn dodger sports bar and restaurant at 7509 third avenue the menu in the front window featured specialty plates named for such worthies as duke and furillo and pee wee and campy and even big klu , who played for the cincinnati reds and had the biggest biceps in all captivity to my knowledge , none of their lawyers have contacted the proprietors of the brooklyn dodger sports bar and restaurant protesting the use of their names on a specialty sandwich but the proprietor of a los angeles baseball team continues to send feral packs of lawyers after this brooklyn place the los angeles dodgers and major league baseball have taken the brazen stand that they own the name brooklyn dodger but i say that walter o'malley forfeited any claim to brooklyn the day he stuffed duke and gil into his personal gunnysack and lit out for the coast and the word dodger \? hey , dickens had the artful dodger , and funk wagnalls has it , too dodger one who dodges , a tricky fellow these tricky fellows sued this brooklyn bar once , but the eminently sensible federal judge constance baker motley ruled that baseball had not protected the name brooklyn dodger baseball has since filed an appeal , which forces the bar s partners , richard picardi and dave senatore and kevin boyle , to divert their efforts from making a living , which is probably the intention of major league baseball it s not like we 're trying to start mcdodgers , said senatore , while serving up a large portion of delicately fried mozzarella sticks this bar is much like any other sports emporium , except that the motif is emphatically brooklyn people donate old souvenirs leo o'mealia s daily news cartoon who s a bum ! from the day the dodgers won the 1955 world series a blownup photo of ebbets field on one wall brings tears to my eyes while i try to explain to my son how furillo could play the caroms in right field duke snider and mickey owen have dropped by pee wee reese and roger kahn , the author of the classic the boys of summer , came by for lunch and signed an old uniform young men and women watch the four televisions and the big screen they root for ken griffey jr and danny tartabull and doc gooden and they mourn reggie lewis they live in the present , but they are respectful of a team called the brooklyn dodgers that does not exist any more the owners of major league baseball would take history and stuff it in their gunnysacks one day soon , nobody will care photo ebbets field , circa 1915 , the home of the dodgers from 1913 to 1957 \( the brooklyn historical society \)
washington , july 22 back in april , the defense department commissioned two studies on how to carry out president clinton s intention to lift the military s ban on homosexuals one , conducted by a panel of generals and admirals , led to the new policy but the pentagon is refusing to make public or even talk much about the other one , a 13 million report by the influential rand corporation the rand report concluded that gay men and lesbians could serve openly in the armed forces if its proposed policy was given strong support from the military s senior leaders , and it offered a detailed plan for carrying out the president s order but it was the study by the panel of generals and admirals , who maintained that open homosexuality would undermine discipline and combat readiness , that prevailed defense secretary les aspin said that he tried to draft a plan closer to mr clinton s original promise to lift the ban entirely , but that the compromise that eventually emerged was the best he could negotiate with the joint chiefs , whose support was essential to win approval in congress lack of chiefs' support the report by rand , a conservatively oriented research group with longstanding ties to the military , suggested that the obstacle might have been neither the lack of a practical option nor the universal opposition of those familiar with military life , but rather the resistance of the six joint chiefs senior civilian pentagon officials said they never seriously considered the rand report as a basis for a new policy on gay rights because the joint chiefs would not support it mr clinton s compromise , allowing homosexuals to serve but only if they keep their sexual orientation private , differs only marginally from existing policy , and bows to the chiefs' insistence that open homosexuality could never be tolerated the rand report started from the assumption that the ban would be lifted entirely , as mr clinton originally ordered , and set out to devise a way to carry out the policy in a way that would preserve morale and order rand found that a policy based on strict requirements for professional conduct could work if strongly supported by the military s senior leadership while heterosexuals will be asked to tolerate the presence of known homosexuals , all personnel , including acknowledged homosexuals , must understand that the military environment is no place to flaunt one s sexual identity or orientation , a summary of the report said executive summaries of the rand report , titled homosexuals and us military personnel policy policy options and assessment , as well as briefing slides presented to mr aspin last month , were provided to the new york times by individuals who felt the study should be made public rand s proposed policy was based on these principles an emphasis should be placed on behavior and conduct , not on teaching tolerance or sensitivity to troops military commanders at all levels must be empowered to carry out the policy and do so forcefully , but reassuringly no extensive revisions to existing military rules and regulations are necessary list categories of inappropriate conduct , including personal harassment , abuse of authority , displays of affection and explicit discussion of sexuality such a policy requires tolerance and restraint to foster the good of the group , but implies no endorsement of a 'homosexual life style , ' the report said rand assigned more than two dozen historians , economists , sociologists , psychologists , anthropologists , doctors and lawyers to the study the head of the study was bernard d rostker , a former head of selective service rand researchers visited canada , britain , france , the netherlands , germany , norway and israel , as well as fire and police departments in new york , chicago , los angeles , seattle , houston and san diego , to gain insights and lessons from analagous organizations and institutions the departments visited report that , over all , the effectiveness of the organization has not been diminished by the presence of homosexuals on the force , an overview of the report said morale and discipline have been maintained , and recruitment and retention rates appear to be unaffected by the presence of known homosexuals the report acknowledged that none of those organizations was an exact model for the military , but rand said comparisons were instructive for assessing changes in policy toward homosexuals in the military military commanders argue that open homosexuals would disrupt unit cohesion , an almost mystical bond that permits soldiers to fight effectively but the rand report said , military leaders have many tools available to prevent this from occurring , including the existence of regulations and norms regulating conduct
chicago , sept 3 fifteen minutes after their 88th loss of the season , half of the mets players were dressed and ready to hit rush street or watch an inhouse hotel movie this afternoon but where was jeff kent \? the second baseman was in the dugout , in full uniform , alone with his bat not that he had done anything productive with it today , but at least he was the one losing player preoccupied and perturbed by the team s latest morose act making a star of cubs pitcher greg hibbard the mets simply fell into an old trap during a 43 loss to chicago at wrigley field the lefthanded hibbard \( 1111 \) threw them a steady stream of relatively slow outside pitches , and the mets kept swinging overanxiously for the beer stand beyond the leftfield bleachers you ca n't tell the difference between his changeup and fastball , left fielder chico walker said more of the same as a result , the pitcher had the mets swinging at ball one , ball two , ball three and sometimes even ball four their impatience had manager dallas green mussing his silver hair it s just a continuation of the way this team has approached the game of baseball forever , green said afterward in the ninth inning , with the mets trailing by 40 , green had a novel idea order someone to swing at a strike with two on and none out , he pulled walker aside , told him to touch nothing out of the strike zone or else and walker paid heed on a changeup that hibbard , for once , threw inside , walker hit a threerun homer that brought the score to 43 and brought reliever randy myers in a rush from the bullpen myers retired the side to earn his 38th save , but the question became what took the mets so long to wait for respectable pitches \? impatience , that s exactly what it is , walker said when you 're a fastballhitting team and you see it coming straight , whether it s fast or slow , you swing it s not a bad habit , it s us being a fastballhitting team and from all the scouts who 've seen us , everyone knows it they pitch us away , away , away , and everyone knows it double play dampens threat kent , however , cannot swallow it the game might have turned in the fourth inning when new york loaded the bases with none out and kent lunged and hit into a double play he grounded to hibbard , who threw to the plate for one out , and the catcher , steve lake , wheeled and completed the double play at first walker then grounded out to end the threat to come away empty like that is a major letdown for everybody , said frank tanana , who took his 14th loss in 20 decisions that time at bat ruined kent s afternoon and was the chief reason he was still on the bench after his teammates were gone i was jumping , he said of the outside pitch he tried to pull i do n't know if it was a strike or not i do n't know tanana sees wrigley tanana , who at 40 pitched for the first time at wrigley field , has now lost almost as many games as anthony young 14 he gave up home runs to sammy sosa and glenallen hill and even two singles to hibbard , who was 2 for 47 before today that s the kind of guy i need to see , hibbard said a guy who does n't throw real hard who i can wait back on on the plus side , at least tanana got to see this classic ball park well , he said , the term 'friendly confines' is a misnomer inside pitch anthony young did not return as a yesman sent to the minor leagues 17 days ago with a 115 record and instructions to sort out his breaking pitches , he rejoined the mets on friday with a somewhat caustic demeanor told he will start sunday in dwight gooden s spot , young did not exactly rush up and thank manager dallas green if he wants me in the rotation , he wants me in the rotation , young said but i'm not flipping back and forth any more young has split the season between both starting and relieving , and it is his no 1 beef green has had a singular rebuttal to that all season what s this about a role \? the manager has said repeatedly your role is when i give you the ball , get an out
president clinton is swimming in treacherous political waters with his latest somalia policy another combat disaster in mogadishu the loss of a large number of americans , the taking of additional hostages would present an enormous threat to his presidency the conciliatory moves yesterday by the factional leader mohammed farah aidid give the president some space in which to breathe , but not much in somalia , there are no guarantees mr clinton s standing with the american public , along with his entire domestic and foreign policy agenda , would be jeopardized by the sight of a few more bodies being dragged through the streets by a jeering crowd , or a few more frightened prisoners videotaped in captivity mr clinton has a lot to lose so he is showing considerable courage by continuing the nation s attempt to do the right thing by somalia the united states has a responsibility in somalia , and it outweighs the question of whether abandoning that country would send the wrong message around the world the us contributed to somalia s troubles at various times during the cold war both the us and the former soviet union saw somalia , a largely rural , nomadic country on the indian ocean and gulf of aden , as a place of strategic importance the somalis were courted , but instead of roses , the beloved was given heavy armaments among the weapons that went to the somalis \( along with training in how to use them \) were recoilless rifles , armored personnel carriers , tanks , antiaircraft guns , rocket launchers and surfacetoair missiles randall robinson , the executive director of transafrica , a research and advocacy organization , said those policies , first from the soviets and then from us , have contributed to the wreckage of somalia somalia has enough arms to outfit a major army twentyfive years ago it had none ultimately the weapons from the coldwar superpowers fell into the hands of somali warlords and were used in the furious factional fighting that reduced the country to anarchy said mr robinson when people want to know what happened to somalia , i say , 'we happened to somalia' it was , of course , the american public s reaction to the agony of starving somalis that led to the hunger relief efforts but beyond the humanitarian impulse , there was something appropriate about the united states moving in a substantial way to help somalia for the most part , that effort is working nearly a million lives have been saved , which is extraordinary as president clinton pointed out on thursday , life is returning to normal in most of somalia crops are growing markets are reopening so are schools and hospitals nearly a million somalis still depend completely on relief supplies , but at least the starvation is gone and none of this would have happened without american leadership and america s troops there were blunders , and the loss of american and somali lives in mogadishu is a tragedy the president s shift in policy is an effort to avoid further blunders and at the same time prevent the progress already made from being undermined mr clinton has made it clear that the united nations will not be calling the shots for us troops faced with the threat of combat and that general aidid will not be frozen out of attempts to negotiate a political solution it should have been obvious from the beginning that the general would have to be dealt with not because he was a good guy , but because he was a legitimate leader of a large number of somalis it was never the proper role of the un or the us to favor one somali faction over another , or to impose a solution by force mr clinton understands that his plan is vulnerable on a number of fronts general aidid , for example , could decide to lie low until the americans leave in a few months he or others could use guerrilla or terror tactics to exploit the lack of support among americans for any further involvement in somalia the risk to president clinton is great but there is something noble about a large and powerful country saving a million lives in a small and troubled one six months is not too long a time to invest in the possibility that a more lasting solution can be found
making what a news release refers to as his classical stage debut in the maids by jean genet , charles busch , arguably new york s most beloved drag performer , is curiously subdued , as if classical simply meant quieter as solange , ostensibly the more violent of the two eponymous domestics , mr busch has scaled down his moviediva mannerisms the grand norma desmond gestures , the katharine hepburn vocal tremolo but they are still in evidence and whether played loud or soft , they seldom feel appropriate to this searing study of the fantasies bred by oppression a large part of mr bush s mainstream popularity as a man who portrays women can be attributed to an utter lack of polemical hostility in his comic characterizations placed in a drama that is fueled by hostility , and forced to squelch his urge to endear , he seems a shrunken presence , merely sly when he should be angry every time claire \( peter francis james \) , the other maid and solange s sister , urges solange to calm down or stop shouting , it is baffling , because there is nothing in mr busch s performance to warrant these admonitions directed and designed by david esbjornson for the classic stage company , the entire production often feels out of kilter genet intended that the maids who act out murderous , ceremonial variations on their relationship with their affluent mistress be played by men , to enhance the perspective of the scorned outsider mr esbjornson has taken the process one step further by setting the play in the basement of an abandoned urban building , which is inhabited by cracksmoking , gunbrandishing squatters , who in turn portray the men who portray the women thematically , this is not in contradiction to the life and myth of jean genet or the tenor of the play but in practice , it imposes another , unnecessarily elaborate subtext that has not been clearly thought through given the number of levels of illusion already operating in the text , audiences new to the maids may have a hard time figuring out what it s really about the problem is further compounded by the performances much of the dramatic thrust of the play hinges on the blurring of the characters' identities , as each , with fierce ambivalence , reinvents and effectively becomes the others in her own imagination mr busch , unfortunately , seems more or less fixed in his persona as madame , the maids' mistress , seth gilliam is loudly imperious and sharpedged , suggesting none of the character s soppy ditheriness and thus erasing the crucial point of the oppressor s mediocrity only mr james , with a delivery that slides between vicious sibilance and sentimental breathiness , conveys the essential sense of mutability and the pain behind the transformations the confused pathos he brings to the part is that of the drag queen and in itself justifies the conceit of a male cast otherwise , in spite of some arresting iconographic flourishes in the staging , this is a maids without teeth or focused energy while the undeniably talented mr busch is to be applauded for seeking out new avenues of expression as an actor , this one leads to a dead end the maids by jean genet translated by bernard frechtman directed by david esbjornson costumes by elizabeth fried scenic design , mr esbjornson lighting by brian macdevitt sound by dan moses schreier set decor , chip white assistant director , anne kauffman production stage manager , crystal huntington presented by classic stage company , mr esbjornson , artistic director patricia taylor , managing director at 136 east 13th street , east village solange charles busch claire peter francis james madame seth gilliam photo charles busch and peter francis james in the maids \( t charles erickson \)

' he deserves a reward for what he did for our country stuart l udall , the former interior secretary who is the lawyer for many of the navajos , said they 've put these people in a bureaucratic legal maze designed to prevent compensation to navajo miners there s no pity for what happened to these people no understanding you have a compassionate program administered in an utterly uncompassionate manner guilt over the money even the families that have been compensated are troubled , not only because of jealousy in a region where many households earn less than 5 , 000 a year but also by the guilt in accepting money they believe is tainted by blood and mourning the 1990 law was a gesture by the government to acknowledge its complicity in the greatest irony of the cold war that the principal victims of the united states' development of a nuclear arsenal were americans , not russians the congress apologizes on behalf of the nation to individuals and their families for hardships they endured , the law read in part helene goldberg , who as director of the torts branch at the justice department administers the compensation program , said she was trying to be sensitive to the navajos and process applications quickly but she said that preventing fraud was a primary concern the problem in most cases is that we have not received the documents we need to establish the illness , ms goldberg said in spite of that , i think we are doing well the statute provides claims to be paid in one year the average approval time is 168 days three categories of victims in the last two years , congress has appropriated 200 million to provide compensation to three categories of people injured or killed by the american nuclear weapons industry or their close family members people living in regions of southern utah and nevada and northern arizona who were exposed to radioactive fallout from atmospheric testing in nevada and developed any of 13 types of cancer they were eligible for payments of 50 , 000 each participants in the actual nuclear tests at the nevada test site near las vegas they were eligible for 75 , 000 payments if they had developed the same cancers uranium miners in colorado , new mexico , arizona , wyoming and utah who developed lung cancer or other respiratory diseases as a result of their work for the nuclear weapons industry from 1947 to 1971 people in this category were eligible for 100 , 000 payments the government in the 1950 s confirmed that the cancers among people in the third group were caused by exposure in the mines to high levels of radon , an odorless , invisible radioactive gas produced from the decay of radium in uranium ores justifying a silence not until the late 1960 s did the government warn the miners of the dangers , according to government documents it justified its silence on the basis of national security and its need for uranium

prague , oct 1 if volkswagen ag has had anything to cheer about this year , it has been the performance of its skoda automobile plant in the czech republic , where sales and profits have been growing as the german auto maker invests in bringing the old communistrun operation up to western standards but now , vw s woes have spread to this country as well , raising questions about the plans for skoda by europe s biggest auto maker last month , volkswagen abruptly canceled plans to borrow 860 million to help finance the modernization of skoda s car factory , in mlada boleslav , 30 miles northeast of here the cancellation raised fear that the previously bright future of skoda , considered by most czechs as their country s corporate jewel and a symbol of its reemergence into the european economy , would be blighted by the problems of its german parent the move was made at a time relations were already strained between volkswagen and the czech government , which technically still holds a majority stake in skoda steeply rising price tags skoda has raised prices three times this year , angering the government and consumers , and pushing the price of its bestselling favorit lx model to 6 , 100 , roughly twice what it cost three years ago skoda executives say the price increases were justified by increased quality skoda , after promising that it would support the czech economy by using local suppliers as much as possible , said this summer that rising prices for components in the czech republic were forcing it to consider importing more parts from western european countries the loan was an important and highly visible element of volkswagen s agreement to invest 55 billion in skoda , acquiring control and building it into a major force in the european auto market volkswagen now has a 31 percent stake , and has agreed to increase that to 70 percent in coming years while doubling production to 450 , 000 cars annually and pushing skoda cars into new markets but volkswagen has been reeling from the european recession and the sharp downturn in auto sales , and the company is further distracted by the longrunning legal troubles of its production chief , jose ignacio lopez de arriortua , who is under investigation for filching trade secrets from the general motors corporation the latest blow came last month , when vw required a 900 million bailout as the result of unexpected losses by seat , its spanish car subsidiary quick trip for repairs volkswagen s chief executive , ferdinand piech , scrambled to limit the political damage , flying to prague late last month and apologizing to top czech officials he reassured them that vw remained committed to the longterm development of skoda mr piech told the czech trade and industry minister , vladimir dlouhy , and the chairman of the national property fund , tomas jezek , that skoda was volkswagen s prettiest daughter , one that would play a key role in the company s future the cancellation of the loan , mr piech said , was a result of increasing efficiency at skoda and a resulting decline in the need for financing it would not , he declared , affect skoda s expansion plans or lead to layoffs prague issued a statement saying it accepts the volkswagen leadership s new strategy jiri skalicky , the czech privatization minister , said in an interview volkswagen s action is obviously a negative signal to a certain extent , and our government is naturally disturbed but we have been assured that volkswagen will carry out its contractual obligations and among the important privatization transactions ahead of us , the negotiations are going on as normal , and we do n't see any reduction in interest from foreign investors skoda executives had said in interviews earlier this year that fasterthanexpected improvement in the company s financial performance would allow volkswagen to reduce its total longterm investment to about 4 billion , or less without much notice but skoda has been exempted for the most part from the sweeping reductions in investment spending that vw officials have imposed on the company s other nameplates volkswagen , audi and seat volkswagen s abrupt cancellation of the loan to skoda it gave almost no warning to skoda management and none at all to the czech government came as an enormous shock here skoda s sales so far this year are up 15 percent , with 137 , 014 cars sold through august , compared with 119 , 161 cars in the similar period last year most of the increase has come in exports to nations of both eastern and western europe , contributing to the czech republic s positive trade balance still , like the other volkswagen divisions , skoda is under intense pressure from mr lopez to reduce costs and to become more demanding of suppliers skoda executives said that in some cases , which they would not specify , the prices of locally produced components had risen above those produced in western europe , and that in those cases the company would consider importing parts that obviously upset some suppliers , many of whom had been encouraged by volkswagen to set up operations in the czech republic last month , a division of lucas industries of britain agreed to establish a joint venture to supply 22 million worth of rear axles to skoda other western suppliers , including the rockwell international corporation , have also set up ventures to supply skoda photo volkswagen s cancellation last month of plans to borrow 860 million to help finance the modernization of its skoda car factory , in mlada boleslav , has raised czech fear that the oncebright future of skoda , which vw is acquiring , might be tarnished by the financial problems of the german parent \( michael persson for the new york times \)

the tournament , sales have risen by 33 percent over the last five years at strombecker corporation , one of the country s oldest toy companies , 57 million marbles have been sold to date this year , compared with 17 million for the same period in 1991 daniel shure , strombecker s president , said that marbles have returned because of the backtothebasics mood of many american parents , new marble designs and more attractive packaging once the stores started carrying the marbles again , parents brought them home , mr shure said but the key to it all rested with the recipients children discovered that playing marbles was fun gene mason , the volunteer director of the tournament here , recently retired as director of the parks and recreation department in cumberland , md there , he supervised a marble sports program involving 3 , 000 youngsters part of marbles' renewed popularity stems from a desire to bring back things associated with the good old days , mr mason said a lot of cities are introducing it in their recreational programs and backing it with financial support and the game is more challenging than it looks , he added try to hit a marble six to eight feet away , he said once you get good at it , you 're hooked you are considered a good marble shooter if you can consistently hit a marble just three feet away the tournament arrangements will have none of the simplicity of a circle drawn in dirt in the backyard the games will be played on 10 blocks of cement , each 12 feet square , set on pilings in the sand a stone s throw from the boardwalk the pale blue playing circle is 10 feet in diameter bleachers will be set up before each match , a wooden cross with holes for 13 marbles is set in the center of the ring , then carefully removed that leaves one marble in the center and three marbles , three inches apart , on each of the four branches the first player to shoot seven marbles out of the ring wins the match the 13 marbles are made of glass and of uniform size , fiveeighths of an inch in diameter the player s weapon is the shooter , which may not be metal and may measure no more than threequarters of an inch in diameter most of the tournament s contestants are expected to use an agate marble , known as an aggie the overall winners will be crowned king and queen of the tournament will each receive a 2 , 000 scholarship voucher redeemable when they enter college new jersey s two entrants have been playing for just a year they were taken to wildwood by their coach , jerry sieber , a high school physical education teacher in cape may county , to introduce them to the tournament setting they still have no idea how big a deal this is , he said donning kneepads , michael and alyisa climbed onto the cement block and got into position for their practice shoot these kids first had to learn eyehand coordination , said mr sieber , as michael s shooter sent two marbles outside the ring , yet stayed within the boundary , allowing him another turn i'm good because i practice a lot , michael declared emphatically mr sieber compared marbles to chess what these youngsters are now catching on to is the strategy of the game , he said what you do on your next move is predicated on the tactical move of your opponent alyisa called out , slips , and mr sieber praised her if a shooter slips from a player s hand and does not roll more than 10 inches , he explained , it is up to the player to alert the referee so that another shot can be taken at the start of a shoot , it s knucklingdown time one knuckle must touch the ground until the shooter leaves the hand advanced players , mr sieber said , have mastered shots like the backspin , which causes the shooter , having sent a target marble out of the circle , to spin backward and stay within the circle if the shooter leaves the circle , another turn is not allowed each morning of the tournament , deborah bass , a representative of the wildwood department of tourism , will arrive at the rings about 6 am , carrying a mop , a broom and the crosses for the marble setup waiting for her will be the contestants , who will practice until the matches start at 8

hall of fame at a ceremony thursday night beri fox , the director of children s programs for marble king and a veteran marble player herself , offered this advice for beginners do n't try to shoot at the straight line of marbles , thinking you 'll hit one you line up outside the circle , take two steps to the left or the right , bend down on your knees , line your nose up even with the second marble from the center aim and shoot then she added jubilantly it works in 1941 , state senator james s cafiero of north wildwood said , he was a regional marble champion , representing his school , st ann s back in those days , part of your regular gear was a bag of marbles , he said recess was a chance to get in a few games in the school playground the wildwood tournament attracts attention , mr cafiero said , because people see in the game of marbles a chance for children to enjoy being children it s a nice , clean , healthy sport , he said , adding , anything that keeps youngsters organized and focused while they are having fun is a big help today photos michael vasser , kneeling at far left , with alyisa mercaldo as they practiced shooting marbles , above and inset , for the

bob lee , the head of the international boxing federation , took an outrageous position this week he attempted to infuse morality into the sport i 've been trying for a long time , he said , but it s not easy it is the reason , he explained , that he denied evander holyfield s petition to fight a heavyweight title unification bout against lennox lewis lee is tilting against the windmill powers behind holyfield , who holds the ibf and world boxing association crowns holyfield , who has earned almost 90 million , wants to fight lewis but , lee disclosed yesterday that he had been in contact with the wba , which is based in venezuela , and that on monday he had told holyfield that neither the ibf nor the wba will sanction the lewis bout as a title fight he said the only title fight those two groups will sanction would be between holyfield and the unbeaten michael moorer , who is ranked as the top challenger by both organizations unification s allure holyfield had decided last week that the allure of being the unified heavyweight champion was irresistible he would continue fighting if he could meet lewis that seemed simple enough , and desirable enough after all , the fight game almost always is defined by the impact of the heavyweight king and one ruler over that fistic domain makes it neat and tidy and significant but not so fast moorer had been sidestepped once , last month , when riddick bowe fought holyfield even though moorer was the topranked contender moorer agreed to that socalled stepaside since moorer is promoted by dan duva , who also happens to be holyfield s copromoter , the challenger has again agreed to step aside for a holyfieldlewis bout but lee wants none of that fine that he went along , said lee but why should he continue to be ranked at the top and be a logjam \? boxing is going to return to the 1940 s and 1950 s if we do n't have the top challenger fighting for the title in the old days , they did what they wanted people today say there are no rules in boxing but we 've got rules the tyson offensive alan dershowitz , lawyer for mike tyson , said yesterday that he would put tyson s accuser , desiree washington , on the stand , and was requesting an immediate hearing in an attempt to overturn the rape conviction of the former heavyweight champion on monday , the indiana court of appeals granted tyson a hearing on a legal point the hearing is an opening wedge it gives us a chance to look at the system , to put her on the stand , the prosecution on the stand , said dershowitz from his office at harvard tyson was convicted in february 1992 of raping washington he is not eligible for parole for another 18 months but dershowitz contends that washington lied under oath when she said she had no plans to sue tyson in a civil case dershowitz added that the prosecution also knew that washington had planned to sue and had even hired a lawyer on a contingency fee whitaker stands alone simon brown , a modest , religious man , is the new wbc junior middleweight champion , thanks to his knockout last saturday night over \( not so \) terrible terry norris norris had been listed as the world s secondbest fighter , poundforpound , in the mythical ranking by boxing illustrated this leaves no doubt who the best fighter in the world is , lou duva chortled yesterday it s pernell whitaker i never thought much of norris s chin duva is whitaker s trainer , and whitaker is the wbc welterweight king there was not much doubt about whitaker s credentials after his draw with julio cesar chavez in san antonio last september the boxing magazine merely echoed most observers when it gave whitaker that imaginary title duva , though , does not believe a whitakerchavez rematch is possible as long as heavyweight mike tyson is in prison duva arrives at that circuitous logic this way tyson was promoted by don king tyson was king s main mealticket in his absence , chavez has become king s main fighter
united nations , june 4 the united nations security council voted overwhelmingly today to authorize the united states and its allies to use air strikes against serbian forces besieging six muslim enclaves in bosnia and herzegovina but washington and its european allies differed on the precise circumstances under which such air strikes would be carried out the clinton administration said today that it wants to confine air operations to protecting the united nations peacekeeping force and not extend it to the safe haven enclaves our obligation is to the allied troops , a state department officials said million muslims in enclaves but the europeans interpreted the resolution more broadly , saying air power should be used against the serbs if the safe havens , in which more than one million muslims live under great hardship , come under renewed assault , or if relief supplies are disrupted the passage of the resolution once again brought bosnia to the top of the white house s agenda , forcing the united states and its allies in the next week or so to work out the circumstances under which nato air power would be engaged the security council measure was passed by a vote of 13 to 0 , with pakistan and venezuela abstaining it was the first time since the start of the civil war in the former yugoslavia two years ago that air strikes were authorized against serbian forces excerpts from resolution , page 6 serbs are confident serbian leaders have been acting with increasing confidence , sensing that they have outbluffed europe , russia and the united states , and no longer see any major obstacles to their drive for hegemony in the former yugoslavia , diplomats and a number of serbs say news analysis , page 6 the plan adopted today was agreed on two weeks ago by the united states , britain , france , russia and spain , but it ran into difficulties in the security council because of opposition by the bosnian muslims and their supporters among islamic and developing countries on the council opponents of the resolution argued that its establishment of safe havens for muslims in effect rewarded the bosnian serbs with control of the 70 percent of bosnia and herzegovina that they have overrun , and the safe havens were compared to refugee camps the resolution was reluctantly embraced by the united states after an earlier proposal by president clinton to rearm the muslims and use air strikes against the serbs was rejected by the european allies the resolution also called for more than doubling the existing 9 , 000member united nations peacekeeping force that has been protecting the muslims and attempting to insure the delivery of food and medicine but the deployment of the additional soldiers is several months away , diplomats said , because pakistan is the only country to have made a firm offer of troops so far and those it wants to send do not yet have the right equipment question of safe passage moreover , no nations are expected to offer troops unless bosnia s serbs guarantee them safe passage into the enclaves it was unclear whether they would do so because their leader , radovan karadzic , has said he does not want any armies of occupation in his selfstyled serbian republic the resolution authorizes nato to work out the details of any military action by saying , member states , acting nationally or through regional organizations or arrangements may take all necessary measures , through the use of air power , in and around the safe areas in the republic of bosnia and herzegovina , to support the united nations protection force in its mandate the united states , britain , france and possibly other nato countries are expected to supply the warplanes in meetings over the next week , they must decide who will order such strikes and whether they will be made only to defend the united nations peacekeepers against attack or to halt assaults on muslim civilians as well new military action will also have to await a report from the united nations secretary general , boutros boutrosghali , explaining in detail how he plans to carry out the provisions of today s resolution and what new resources he will need , an administration official said today this report is not expected for a week or 10 days 10 , 000 more troops authorized today s resolution authorized the secretary general to send up to 10 , 000 additional peacekeeping troops to guard the bosnian capital , sarajevo , as well as the towns of tuzla , zepa , srebrenica , gorazde and bihac the resolution also instructed the united nations forces to use force as necessary to halt further serbian bombardments , armed incursions or attempts to obstruct united nations relief operations united nations forces of varying sizes are now in five of the six muslim cities and towns the exception is gorazde , which has been totally isolated by the serbs the debate before the final vote was one of the most divisive the council has experienced since the start of the bosnian war despite its reservations , pakistan reaffirmed its willingness to send up to 3 , 000 troops to help guard the safe havens complaints from third world
a woman who makes it to the top of a company is likely to act more like the men who reach the same heights than like women farther down the corporate food chain that , at least , was the widespread belief when , in 1990 , the harvard business review published an article that begged to differ the ways women lead , by judy b rosener , reported that women were doing very well , thank you , and they were doing it by behaving like women her study of 456 successful female executives revealed , she wrote , that men and women use very different leadership styles men prefer a command and control style in dealing with subordinates relying on orders , appeals to selfinterest , rational decisionmaking and rewards women prefer to work interactively , sharing power and information , motivating by appeals to organizational goals and promoting empowerment ms rosener s article and a book the female advantage , by sally helgesen helped inspire dozens of other works that elaborate on the difference point of view women , the theory goes , are intuitive , antihierarchical , processoriented , tolerant of ambiguity and not invested in power they think in webs of many factors , not in straight lines men , by contrast , are logical , hierarchical , goaloriented , intolerant of ambiguity and interested in power for power s sake in part because there may be some tiny and slippery kernel of truth to these gender paradigms , in part because they appeal to some firmly held if dubious beliefs , advocates of the female advantage and difference theories reign along with gurus of quality and customer service as the people corporations want to hear from today but many researchers on the subject say the theories appear to be grounded more in anecdote and interpretation than in wellconstructed studies and hard data these researchers argue that there is little substantial evidence that men and women are fundamentally different , even if it might seem so because of the different expectations placed upon them and the divergent courses their lives take i just do n't see any good evidence for the 'difference' perspective , said myra strober , a labor economist at stanford university it glorifies existing stereotypes of female behavior these researchers argue that managers who talk about recruiting women to create a nurturing , antihierarchical ambience at work may foster resentment among women and men who do n't fit the models and among employees who think one group is being favored over another what is more , they warn , it would be hard to make a case for legal protections for women in the workplace if they are indeed superior there is n't much doubt that this is a time of sexrole confusion at work as well as at home as the american work force becomes increasingly diverse , companies are trying to become more sensitive to the concerns of employees other than middleaged heterosexual white men but do women , especially , have attributes that make them more suited to the struggle for global competitiveness \? cokie roberts , the abc news correspondent , joked recently that she could think of no better preparation for covering congress than motherhood they all act like 2yearolds , she explained the origins of debate the debate about differences winds back to the work of a woman , carol gilligan , a harvard psychologist , and several children , including jake and amy , who featured prominently in ms gilligan s 1982 book , in a different light psychological theory and women s development jake , described by ms gilligan as a bright , articulate 11yearold , thought heinz , a poor man , should steal medicine to save his dying wife and assume he could convince a judge he had done the right thing amy , another bright , articulate 11yearold , thought heinz should find another way borrow the money , perhaps , or talk out his problems with the druggist , because stealing might set off an unpredictable , uncontrollable chain of events what if heinz went to jail , and his wife got sicker , and he could n't get more of the drug \? jake s selfconfident typically male solution outranked amy s typically female one on the standard scale of moral development used by psychologists click , went ms gilligan maybe there s a problem with a scale that automatically subtracts points for reasoning through a problem in a way many women would recognize ms gilligan s work filtered out to many professional working women maybe , ms gilligan s many acolytes and popularizers have suggested in the ensuing decade , the problem is men , not women by extension , maybe the problem is the institutions men dominate with a winnertakeall , commandandcontrol style enter ms rosener , a professor in the graduate school of management at the university of california at irvine , and her thesis of a female difference a political scientist by training , ms rosener wrote the harvard business review article using results from a survey of women who belonged to a women s leadership organization

today is the last day of august tomorrow and thursday are the first two days of september for the san francisco giants , though , the only relevant date is what month it is on barry bonds s calendar when the giants played the atlanta braves in san francisco last week , bonds s calendar said it was october if it is still october these next three nights , the giants will be in serious trouble in their effort to win the national league west championship bonds , until now a lock for his third most valuable player award in four years , has been the player most responsible for the giants' fourmonth stay in first place the giants' new owners were criticized by other owners for signing him for 4375 million , but the left fielder batting 338 after last night s 51 victory over florida , with a leagueleading 38 home runs and 100 runs batted has largely been responsible for the team s resurgence in the standings and in san francisco yet that resurgence threatens to be deflated just as the giants reach the most exciting stage of the season the results of the series in san francisco a sweep by the braves ca n't encourage the giants for the series in atlanta for one thing , the giants' pitching seems to be collapsing , and for another , bonds has hit his postseason wall early for bonds , postseason games are the food poisoning of the baseball year he has played in the past three national league championship series with the pittsburgh pirates in the last two of those series , bonds batted against braves' pitchers , mostly the same ones who have the braves four and a half games behind the giants and poised to complete a dramatic comeback for their third consecutive division championship for all three pennant playoffs , bonds batted 191 \( 13 for 68 \) , hit1 home run , drove in 3 runs and got 2 hits in 33 atbats \( 061 \) with runners on base \( a total of 42 \) in the two series against the braves , he batted 200 \( 10 for 50 , with half of the hits coming in the last 3 of 14 games \) , hit 1 home run , drove in 2 runs and had 1 hit in 26 atbats \( 038 \) with runners on base \( a total of 31 \) it could be argued that none of this is relevant to the series beginning in atlanta tonight , but his performance against the braves last week was reminiscent of bonds s hitting in those postseason games in 11 times at bat against the braves last week , bonds collected three singles and drove in one run typical of his failure at critical junctures of the playoff games was his time at bat in the sixth inning of the final game of the series the giants were losing , 60 , and had two runners on base with one out a big hit from bonds could put them back in the game , with the chance to salvage one of the three games and restore their lead to six and a half games but greg maddux retired bonds on a foul pop , and the giants salvaged nothing maddux \( 159 \) will be the first pitcher bonds and the giants see in the final series between the teams this season john smoltz \( 139 \) and steve avery \( 154 \) will start the other two games the giants , with a starting rotation undermined by sudden ineffectiveness and injuries , will use bill swift \( 176 \) , bryan hickerson \( 65 \) and john burkett \( 186 \) they could have used jim deshaies , their weekend acquisition from minnesota , either tomorrow or thursday , but manager dusty baker prefers to save the fly balls batters hit against deshaies for st louis s more spacious park on friday swift and burkett are the giants' big two starters , but they have done little in their last three starts even with seven shutout innings against florida , swift has compiled a 500 earned run average since he last won in his most recent loss , the braves battered him for four home runs and six runs in four and a third innings last wednesday once a reliever , swift has pitched more innings \( 183 2 3 \) than he ever has in a season , and may be wearing down burkett has fared even worse in his past three starts , emerging with two losses and a 1315 era he , too , could be suffering from mound fatigue with a total of 190 2 3 innings , close to his careerhigh of 206 2 3 maybe dick pole , the giants' pitching coach , knew something a few weeks ago when he was asked about swift and burkett and the distinction for which they appeared to be headed at the time , burkett had just gained his 18th victory and swift his 17th , and they were on track to become the first 20game winning teammates since 1985 and the first to do it for the giants since 1966 they have n't done it yet , pole cautioned i had an experience in 1988 with a kid who was 151 at the allstar break , and he wound up 187 or something like that he was talking of maddux , then with the chicago cubs , who went from 153 at the break to 188 burkett and swift , pole was suggesting , could find the five victories they need the most difficult they ever have attained the giants certainly could use two of those five while they are in atlanta if they do n't get them , or two victories from any pitchers , they would leave brutally aware that the braves have them right where they want them struggling for victories , steadily slipping in the standing and just possibly panicking as they enter the final month of the season a page 1 headline in a chicago newspaper recently read , bonds may rescue schools the giants desperately need their bonds to rescue them photo barry bonds s performance against atlanta last week brings to mind some of his failures in postseason play in recent years \( reuters \)
san francisco , june 6 kaleida labs inc , motorola inc and scientificatlanta inc said today that they had agreed to develop jointly the software and hardware for delivering interactive and multimedia services to homes through cable television networks scientificatlanta had previously been identified as the supplier of settop control boxes for an experimental interactive cable operation which time warner inc has planned for orlando , fla the new alliance would pose a challenge to the intel corporation , the microsoft corporation and the general instrument corporation , which earlier this spring announced an alliance to develop a settop device interactive television services are expected to include video games and movies that customers could order any time for immediate play multimedia is computerlike television programming that combines sound , images and computer text under the agreement , kaleida a joint venture of apple computer inc and ibm would supply its multimedia software , scriptx , for use in settop devices and network equipment made by scientificatlanta an 'opportune time' scriptx allows multimedia programs to run on a variety of different hardware from different manufacturers motorola would supply a lowcost version of the power pc microprocessor developed jointly by the international business machines corporation and apple we 've had relationships with both these companies on a fairly active basis for some time , nat goldhaber , the president and chief executive of kaleida , said in a telephone interview we decided this was the opportune time to begin working together in earnest he said settop boxes resulting from the effort would not appear before the summer of next year the new alliance faces formidable competition from general instrument , the largest maker of settop converters the company has said it intended to produce boxes incorporating microsoft software and intel microprocessors next year the boxes would range from simple devices with no computing capability priced at about 150 , to advanced programmable models priced at about 300 many competitors have worried that microsoft and intel would dominate the interactive media business as they have the personal computer market relationships not exclusive mr goldhaber said the kaleida joint venture represented a very , very strong attempt to create a completely open architecture in computer terms , open means the various components of a system could be bought from multiple vendors , allowing customers maximum flexibility and promoting competition mr goldhaber said none of the relationships in the agreement are exclusive , so other companies would have access to the same technology not only does this bring the power of a computer to the consumer for the price of a settop converter , mr goldhaber said , it also vastly broadens the market opportunity for multimedia content developers some reports in the trade press have indicated that scientificatlanta would supply the settop boxes to time warner using hardware manufactured by the toshiba corporation and based on the mips chip developed by silicon graphics inc this now seems unlikely in light of the announcement regarding motorola but a related report that silicon graphics would supply the socalled video servers that would store and present entertainment media on the network would not seem to conflict with today s announcement neither time warner nor silicon graphics has been willing to comment on the reports
first thoughts on the tonys of course it s premature , with half a season to go , but hey , handicapping the tony awards is a yearround sport besides , by now the outline of the season has begun to unblur , and this is the time of year that cagey producers of yettoopen shows start analyzing the competition the first question is where the nominees for best play are going to come from aside from tony kushner s perestroika and neil simon s laughter on the 23d floor , none of the other new plays to open this fall are likely to last even through the year s end wonderful tennessee , the most artful of the fall s failures , closed so quickly that the producers never even got around to inviting tony voters to see it , and according to a new rule this year , that makes the show ineligible for any awards a few producers hope to open before the tony deadline fran and barry weissler have reserved may 4 , the final day of eligibility , for my thing of love , by alexandra gersten , but they have already jumped the gun once , announcing that sigourney weaver was set to appear in it when that turned out not to be quite true ms weaver s participation is still up in the air and robert whitehead has reserved april 24 for broken glass , by arthur miller its worldpremiere run begins at the long wharf in new haven in march , but if it does n't open to some acclaim , who knows whether it will make the transfer one other possibility is the rise and fall of little voice , jim cartwright s play , now at the steppenwolf theater in chicago the nederlander organization would like to bring it in , but there are n't any certain plans at the moment the dearth of potential nominees raised the possibility that the national actors theater production of timon of athens might qualify because it had never before been produced on broadway that would force voters to answer the following intriguing question is secondtier shakespeare better than firsttier kushner \? imagine the delicious debate alas , several years ago , the tony administration committee anticipated just such a situation and instituted a rule relegating all classic plays to revival status \( the potentially amusing discourse notwithstanding , contemporary playwrights would have a legitimate beef if they suddenly found themselves having to compete with , say , moliere or shaw \) as it turns out , shakespeare suffers by the rule , too , because the bestrevival category seems sure to be the most hotly contested this year not only is there a parade of musicals and the current stately production of abe lincoln in illinois , but there are other plays forthcoming pinter s no man s land and william inge s picnic are scheduled for the roundabout gogol s government inspector begins previews shortly at the national actors theater , and j b priestley s detective thriller an inspector calls arrives at a shubert house , probably in march that leaves best musical both cyrano and the red shoes have had a difficult time of it , which has led the producers of off broadway s feisty bantam annie warbucks to consider a move this spring nonetheless , the competition is shaping up as a contest between a new bully on the block and an old one beauty and the beast , the disney extravaganza that opens at the palace in march , is expected to create a cats like fury at the box office its justannounced opposition is passion , with music by stephen sondheim , book and direction by james lapine it begins performances march 28 at the plymouth theater , with an official opening april 28 a 14character show , passion has an eclectic bunch of producers a theater giant , the shubert organization a media giant , cap cities abc inc a deeppocketed theater producer , roger berlind , who is generally successful but who just lost a bundle on paper moon , and the ubiquitous filmandtheater crossover guy , scott rudin the show is to be produced by arrangement with lincoln center theater , which held a workshop of it this fall the story concerns a man torn by his feelings for two women , one beautiful and the other ugly , sickly , an unattractive woman in all respects , in mr lapine s words it is based on fosca , an 1869 italian novel by i u tarchetti , which was made into a movie , passione d'amore , by ettore scola casting is just beginning , mr lapine said , adding that peter gallagher , donna murphy and marin mazie , who played the three main roles in the lincoln center workshop which included some nudity were certainly in the running it s very racy , mr lapine admitted so it s not a disney show lenny bruce s mother s boyfriends one other possibility in the play category is sally and her escorts , an intriguing project but an odd enough duck that even its nervous star , joan rivers \( yes , that joan rivers \) , is loath to call it a play the show features ms rivers as the reallife character sally marr , lenny bruce s mother , a tough , iconoclastic former entertainer whom ms rivers met in 1986 she s 86 , ms rivers said but say 84 there are also three actors in the cast , who appear as the various men in ms marr s life but who do n't speak the show , written by ms rivers , lonny price and erin sanders , is based on more than 100 hours of taperecorded interviews ms rivers conducted with ms marr about her life it s not a play , and it s not a onewoman show , ms rivers said i ai n't putting on funny hats , as they say i guess it s a performance piece i'm going in with great trepidation , hat in hand i hope they like me i hope the first line is n't 'vegas comic joan rivers shows up' ms rivers said the seed of the show was actually planted in 1962 , when she was performing standup at new york clubs , doing a routine , shocking at the time , about her affair with a married man audiences were not responsive it was a tough time , ms rivers said , and then one night after a show at the bitter end in greenwich village , she received a note backstage that said you 're right they 're wrong it was from lenny bruce he was close to my heart from then on , she said and when she was introduced to sally marr by the comedian jackie gayle , she said , she realized that so much of his philosophy is what sally taught him twothirds of what came from him came from her the show is to be produced by martin richards , robert cole and sam crothers for about 850 , 000 , most likely at the helen hayes theater but the opening date is in doubt the producers said previews would begin in march for an opening in late april , in time for the tony deadline ms rivers , and her agent , bob duva , however , said she had another commitment through march and was n't set to begin until april photo karen ziemba goes 'crazy ' karen ziemba , who has

the daily news , bankrupt and battered when mortimer b zuckerman bought it last january , is now a profitable business , its publishers say , reversing multimilliondollar losses and defying predictions of doom that plagued the new york newspaper for a decade about a hundred newly hired writers and editors are settling in advertising revenues are climbing , the publishers say and the newspaper s pages are beginning to show some of their old zip in effect , the owners are betting millions of dollars that the cheeky but rigorous style of tabloid journalism that the news virtually invented can thrive again in america s biggest city the bet appears to be paying off the signs of rebirth at what is still , by far , new york city s largestcirculation tabloid newspaper have some in the newspaper industry saying that mr zuckerman s news is likely to be a powerful contestant in a new tabloid war the news right now has more going for it than the others , said gerald d reilly , a newspaper broker and financial consultant who has followed the new york city newspaper battles for decades ultimately , zuckerman may be the one who survives the news has recently been selling about 775 , 000 copies a day while that is less than a third of its 24 million circulation in 1947 , it is almost double that of the new york post , its closest tabloid competitor the post sells about 400 , 000 copies a day , and new york newsday about 270 , 000 , newspaper executives said predictions of profit fred drasner , mr zuckerman s copublisher and owner of a minority share of the news , said in an interview that the newspaper would be substantially profitable this year some newspaper industry executives said the news , which lost about 100 million over the last 10 years , could make a profit this year , perhaps as much as 10 million mr reilly said he thought the newspaper had become profitable , but perhaps not at that level because the news is privately owned , its profits do not have to be reported and cannot be verified the new york post has cut its annual losses to about 6 million , executives of the newspaper said new york newsday loses 8 million to 14 million a year , newsday s publisher , robert m johnson , said recently advertising revenue at the news is up more than 6 percent compared with yearearlier levels , news executives say , though they do not give figures the newspaper has cut labor , newsprint and other costs we are committed to making this a firstrate paper , mr zuckerman said in an interview you ca n't do that unless the paper is profitable and economically viable the paper is economically viable by all accounts , the news has a long way to go in its rebuilding it is searching for a distinctive voice , it must build a new 135 million color printing plant , and it is still weakened by years of troubles that included a bitter fivemonth strike in 199091 against the tribune company of chicago , then the newspaper s owner many of the business challenges that weakened the news in the first place have remained newspaper readership has been in decline nationally for decades and many of the news s loyal readers moved to the suburbs from workingclass city neighborhoods that were traditional news strongholds and as news management digs in for the war of the tabloids , it does not know how much money rupert murdoch , who controls the post , and the times mirror company , which owns new york newsday , are prepared to pour into the battle but inside the news , reporters , editors and business employees say that for the first time in a dozen years , they feel that they are part of an enterprise with a future and outside the news s 42nd street headquarters , the newspaper is beginning to attract attention again a sharper focus for the first six months of mr zuckerman s ownership , the newspaper appeared to drift under his first editor , lou colasuonno in july , mr zuckerman installed a new editor in chief , martin dunn , above mr colasuonno , in what some at the news said was already a topheavy newsroom mr dunn , who is british and the former editor of a murdoch tabloid in london , has so far received high marks for unifying the staff and focusing the paper on the kinds of issueoriented , snappily presented articles that were once typical of the news one of mr dunn s early ideas resulted in the strippers , the newspaper s frontpage article on a sunday last month the news had bought a 1985 honda , parked it on a new york city street , and had its photographers watch by the fourth day of the vigil , car strippers had reduced it to a bucket of bolts that was a curbside blight and barely resembling a vehicle that , mr dunn said , was the kind of hey , mabel article \( as in hey , mabel , look at this ! \) that the news must present for the first time in a long time , news readers are beginning to find a regular mix of the humor and outrage that are the hallmarks of tabloid journalism last week , larry sutton , a writer , described what leona helmsley , the hotel executive who was convicted of tax evasion , would find in her new quarters at the marquis hotel halfway house the account on the new digs of the hotel queen included a chart comparing the halfway house \( bathroom yes amenities none \) with the plush new york palace that she used to run last month , a news reporter , annette fuentes , wrote separated at birth , an account of de facto segregation in the maternity wards of mount sinai medical center the article drew wide attention we still are the dominant tabloid paper , mr dunn said , we have to , really , by sheer force of journalism , impose ourselves back on the new york market new money , new sections
bolinas , calif sean thackrey is the curator of a small art gallery , bob lamborn is a semiretired private investigator and dick stark is a former silicon valley marketing executive but all three would insist they share a single vocation winemaker with production under 2 , 000 cases a year each , none of their wineries amounts to so much as a rounding error in industry statistics , but they are part of a new breed of independent producers microwineries with a surprising degree of influence as many of the scores of microwineries in the country have earned rave reviews from influential publications like the wine advocate and wine spectator , they have been able to command high prices and sell out their production year after year typically owned and operated by one person or one family , microwineries satisfy the wine enthusiasts' craving for new experiences and as the larger producers turn out wines that are often very similar , the microwineries offer the kind of individual expression associated with familyowned domaines of western europe and with the boutique california wineries of the 1960 s , like ridge vineyard and freemark abbey many of the socalled boutiques , which typically produce about 40 , 000 cases a year , continue to flourish , but a significant number have declared bankruptcy in the past few years or are for sale with no takers wine industry analysts say the boutique size is no longer viable except for established players with little debt or for wellheeled newcomers willing to lose money for a very long time in the last 10 years , wine distributors have gone through a dramatic consolidation from dozens to just two or three per major market and the survivors do not have room for hundreds of midsized brands at the same time , costs have soared but microwineries can bypass distributors , selling most of their tiny production to mailinglist customers , or hand delivering a few cases at a time to specialty retailers and prestige restaurants direct contact with an owner who is also the producer appeals to wine buffs , and the exclusivity of these wineries pleases the owners of small shops who have seen the boutiques defect to warehouse clubs and supermarkets microwineries remain an area where an individual can craft highly idiosyncratic , distinctive wines , said james laube , senior editor of the wine spectator there s that small , handson , handcreated effect , he said , adding that the tiny wineries can have an influence that belies their size they drive a lot of the market the way couturiers start fashion trends with oak barrels and stainless steel tanks stacked in his windswept backyard on the coast above bolinas , some 20 miles north of san francisco , mr thackrey makes wines primarily from grapes associated with the rhone valley of southern france , like syrah and mourvedre , but with concentrated , almost sweet , flavors unlike any french model you have to have a distinct and definite personality or no one s going to pay any attention to you , said mr thackrey then you have to find out who cares many enthusiasts care for mr thackrey s flagship wine , orion , which sells for 30 a bottle in virtually every vintage it has been a flamboyant and dramatic wine , with bold flavors , great varietal character and awesome potential , robert parker , publisher of the wine advocate , has written of orion the problem , of course , is the extremely limited availability the problem for mr thackrey is that he has extremely limited capital , and after orion s success brought attention to the napa vineyard that supplied his grapes , it was sold to an avowed admirer of the wine , cutting off mr thackrey s source what i found so infuriating was the direct line between admiring my wine and buying the vineyard , he said the major problem for a winery my size is you simply do n't count in vineyard decisions he recently found a new source of syrah grapes , but said he remains worried about the long term it is no small worry , said paul draper , president of the ridge vineyard in cupertino , calif if you 're not in control of your soil , he said , you 're forever doomed to being a manufacturer that flits from source to source , and as soon as you make one source famous , it s gone bob lamborn has avoided that problem he owns nine acres on howell mountain in napa county , where he made a name with his lamborn family vineyard even as he continued to earn most of his income as a private investigator he said his unusual day job actually drew the attention of wine critics who might have overlooked the wine that enabled me to get a little piece of the market , to have my little niche on the shelf , my following in a few restaurants , he said one day recently at the height of the harvest season but this is the first year that i will be principally dependent on it dick stark , owner and winemaker at the page mill winery in los altos hills , calif , has supported his family with his 2 , 000case operation for 17 years , producing some of his grapes on his own land and buying the rest
it has always been a game decided by stars basketball always will be when it counted most last night , the nets' stars were bigger than the knicks' derrick coleman , the nets' best big man , hit a clutch 3point shot , dead on from behind the key he blocked patrick ewing s turnaround jump shot in the lane he made two free throws he had to make kenny anderson , soul of the nets' backcourt , kept his team in the game by wreaking havoc in the lane he gave it the lead for good with a driving fastbreak layup \( and ensuing free throw \) over john starks , who broke anderson s wrist last season with a flagrant foul when it counted most , with the knicks desperately trying to hang onto what had been a 13point lead , the slumping starks heaved successive 3point clankers at the rim , the second leading to anderson s electric 3point drive when two free throws absolutely had to be made , with the knicks down to twotenths of a second left in the game , ewing stepped to the line every player likes to be in a situation like that , said coleman you dream about situations like that maybe ewing does n't he threw up a brick the nets rallied from 13 points behind to beat the knicks , 9795 , last night at madison square garden do n't blame greg anthony for this one blame the knicks' best blame starks , whose jump shot remained out of commission , accompanied by his judgment blame ewing , who limited himself to nine foulplagued , firsthalf minutes because he still buys every pump fake thrown his way 15 feet from the basket and because he could n't make the plays true franchise players are supposed to make while we 're on the subject of star culpability , coach pat riley did n't have a timeout with 41 seconds left and with the nets' kevin edwards trying to give the nets an insurmountable 4point lead edwards missed the second shot the knicks ran the ball up the floor they lucked out when johnny newman reached in on ewing as the knick center turned to shoot ewing s sorry free throw deflected the postgame heat from riley , but some blame should be directed at the coach as well just do n't blame rolando blackman earlier in the day , blackman had become the latest knick role player to go under the microscope , to be asked to save the championship season a swarm of reporters awaited his arrival in the pregame locker room blackman walked in at about 5 30 and immediately announced he was n't talking he had said what he had to say after the team s morning shootaround he said i'm in the rotation now and my only thought is to come in and do the job now , several hours later , he did n't have it in him to tell everyone to just get lost blackman happens to be one of the nicest guys in any team sport uniform he shook hands all around , and said he hoped we understood here is what everyone needs to understand , and soon hubert davis s broken hand , which sends him to the sidelines for half a dozen weeks , should not be such a big deal for the knicks if the bulls can handle losing michael jordan , the knicks ought to be able to hold their ground in a wobbled eastern conference without davis if not , if ewing and starks continue coming up small at the end of close games like last night s , there really is n't anything to talk about , now is there \? davis was the backup shooting guard , averaging 20 minutes and 93 points a game without shooting well , blackman had 8 by halftime last night against the nets by the end of the game , blackman may have been the best thing the knicks had going for them he made a sweet 22footer that broke an 8585 tie he hit the 3point shot that gave ewing that final chance to fail if there is anything the knicks are deep in , it is interchangeable parts they have been built around one superstar , ewing , and one emerging star , starks for the most part , the knicks are like one of those casts from the disaster movies that were popular 15 years ago many familiar names , none of them robert redford or tom cruise doc rivers s injury was a serious blow because he was the smartest and maybe the most fearless guy in the lineup and because anthony has been going to work every night with a shattered ego rivers was missed in a game like last night s riley did n't have the confidence to play anthony late that put the ball in starks s hands right now , starks is missing in action more than anyone who s on the injured list starks s woeful shooting continued , 6 for 23 he has been shooting in the low 30 s the past two weeks he is getting close to dropping under 40 percent for the season the knicks were hoping he could become an allstar this season they were at least counting on him to carry a major portion of the offense , with ewing he left the garden looking like he was carrying the weight of the sellout crowd on his back not only had he bombed , but anderson got some revenge for last season s meadowlands takedown after anderson made that layup on the break with 325 seconds left , he turned to starks and said guess what \? i was just happy that it gave us the lead , said anderson sitting next to him was his college coach , bobby cremins , here with georgia tech for the holiday festival the silverhaired coach smiled he recognized a star keeping cool when he saw one photo patrick ewing , right , and charles oakley struggling to maintain their balance as they try to pull in a rebound during last night s loss
finally , president clinton has completed the easy job negotiating supplemental accords to the north american free trade agreement with mexico and canada but that leaves him the hard job of negotiating with the people down the block members of congress intimidated by fearmongering attacks by ross perot and the stalwart opposition of some powerful democrats like the house majority leader , richard gephardt congressional opposition is unfortunate because nafta would have a positive , though small , impact on the us economy even without the supplemental accords the accords make nafta even better by adding a thin layer of protection for us companies facing potentially unfair competition from mexico mr clinton promised during the campaign to improve the trade agreement negotiated by the bush administration by eliminating the unfair competitive advantage that would be gained by mexican companies that cut costs by violating their country s environmental and labor laws mr clinton suggested at the time that the answer might be to set up international commissions to establish mutually agreed rules and regulations but none of the countries were comfortable with such extraterritorial rulemaking besides , mexican laws were n't the problem they 're generally as good as their us counterparts the problem is the enforcement record of the mexican government , which is execrable the supplemental accords zero in on enforcement if an international panel of experts finds that a country , say mexico , persistently fails to enforce its laws , then its government would be fined if violations persist , trade sanctions could follow the accord is the first trade agreement to use fines and trade sanctions to back up labor and environmental protections imposing fines on governments , rather than on noncomplying companies , may seem an odd proposal but it s quite clever the fines are designed to compel the government to improve its enforcement record , especially when trade sanctions are lurking close behind if nafta were instead to impose fines directly on noncomplying companies , it would give us businesses ferocious incentive to bring frivolous charges against mexican competitors on the outside chance of driving them from the market mr gephardt objects that the proposed fines wo n't be imposed for an important category of violations failure to protect labor s right to strike , organize and collectively bargain but the mexican government refused to give in on this politically charged issue and it s unclear how much mr clinton wanted to open us companies to such accusations mr gephardt also wanted to force mexico to raise wages along with productivity but as mexico s market reforms take hold , wages will rise if the us imposed artificially high wages on mexican employers , the policy would produce the same result in mexico that it did in eastern germany after unification widespread unemployment careful studies show that nafta would have a minor overall impact on jobs and wages in the us some us workers would lose work , but the number would n't be large the congressional budget office estimates that over 10 years nafta would add fewer than 500 , 000 to the 20 million workers who would be displaced for other reasons the proper response is not for congress to reject nafta , and thereby deny benefits to hundreds of millions of others rather congress should provide generous retraining and relocation assistance to those who will suffer over the past several years , and under pressure from washington , mexico has launched important market reforms and to overcome congressional resistance to nafta , mexico has spent millions of dollars more to monitor and clean up the environment it started near the bottom and still has a long way to go but there are at least signs that it is taking the united states' environmental concerns seriously had president clinton now overreached and kicked away nafta , he would also have kicked away real progress that would have been bad economics and even worse politics the supplemental protections that mr clinton negotiated are porous , but the holes in the original agreement were n't large and did n't need major surgery
the prospectus by guess \? inc for a private debt offering of 120 million provides some insights about the split between the company s chairman , georges marciano , and his brothers , who have combined innovative designs , fabrics and advertising to make guess \? jeans a fashion sensation over the course of the past two years , georges marciano and maurice , paul and armand marciano have had differing opinions regarding certain aspects of the company s business , said the offering memorandum , which has been circulated to just a few potential investors and provides a rare peek into a privately held company with profitability that has , until now , only been rumored the prospectus also details how the brothers became wealthy by taking millions of dollars out of their business in the form of high salaries , benefits and deals between guess \? and other companies they own the difference in opinions to which the prospectus alludes goes to the heart of the company s business georges , who will remain chairman and chief executive of guess \? until his brothers buy him out , a move expected by the end of august , felt the company should broaden its distribution beyond the department stores that have been its biggest customers according to people familiar with the company , mr marciano felt guess \? should move into the mass market by selling products to merchants like walmart and sears his brothers preferred to continue developing the business in department stores and through the company s own retail outlets wiping out equity the differences are evidently deep enough that maurice , paul and armand are willing to wipe out the company s equity to buy their brother s 40 percent stake in guess \? with about 220 million , which the company will have to borrow according to the prospectus , the debt will turn the company s positive 153 million net worth into a deficit of at least 47 million and perhaps more , although the company s powerful cash flow could help restore the balance sheet fairly soon the debt sale , the first ever for the company , is being managed by merrill lynch company it gives institutional investors the opportunity to lend money to a company which has seen profits grow since 1989 at a 224 percent compounded clip to reach 1084 million last year sales have soared at a similar pace , to 492 million in 1992 but the offering might put a crimp in the brothers' life style in recent years , they have drawn millions of dollars in salaries , perquisites , rent , licenses and side deals that was in addition to the 204 million they received before taxes as their share of profits in the last three years georges also was paid 87 million in salary , bonuses and other compensation last year each of his brothers was paid more than 5 million their 25 million in compensation accounted for about 18 percent of the company s administrative expenses all four brothers have cars and drivers at their disposal , and paul and georges have bodyguards the company carries almost 25 million worth of art and 18 million in aircraft on its books , presumably for the benefit of the brothers the company is active in real estate familyowned real estate guess \? leases two buildings for more than 2 million a year from a limited partnership which lists the brothers as its sole partners the company plans to lease more space from paul , armand and maurice later this year the company also sold the brothers its corporate offices and distribution operations in los angeles for 24 million and then leased the buildings back for about 2 million a year guess \? is not averse to doing business with family members , either in 1989 , the company began its retail operations by buying 21 stores from none other than the marciano brothers the next year , it gave a licensing agreement to maurice s fatherinlaw , whose company , charles david of california , makes leather and rubber footwear with the guess \? logo the brothers also have an interest in charles david and early this year , guess \? bought a 51 percent stake in a tv and record production company , g c entertainment inc , owned by trusts controlled by paul and georges it then lent g c 487 , 000 , which the entertainment company used to repay loans the two brothers had made to it outside investors must consider that the money they would be putting up to buy the notes would not stay in the company rather , it would leave to help georges finance his own ventures , some of which might go on to start the next guess \? rival georges is also walking away with his name , which is trademarked and a prominent element in the company s marketing efforts , although guess \? will be able to use it for a year after he leaves while he is limited to using the trademark on up to five retail stores for two years , after that georges will be free to pursue other interests and may compete with the company in any manner , according to the offering document securities and exchange commission filings indicated that mr marciano has significant investment in cherokee inc and in farah inc , two other makers of casual clothing he might be a tough competitor though merrill lynch and other financial advisers to the company have played down the recent role of georges in guess \? , the document acknowledged that he has had primary responsibility for the design of guess \? products , made substantial contributions to expanding the business and lent his name to many of its marketing programs there is also some evidence in the company s recent performance that his wish to sell guess \? goods in mass market outlets might be smart in the last two years , the average sales per square foot in the company s own retail stores have declined 30 percent , to 385 from 550 but sales in the company s factory outlet stores jumped 11 percent , to 637 a square foot from 573 comparable store sales sank 146 percent , partly because of the weak economy in california analysts consider comparable sales , or sales in stores open at least a year , a better indicator of a retailer s performance but the trend indicates that it may be harder for guess \? to sell its products at full price and confirms reports by retail consultants who say they are seeing more of its products for sale in offprice stores like marshall s and filene s basement ultimately , the public may have the chance to vote on which brother was right although merrill lynch is placing the debt privately instead of selling it publicly , the offering is viewed as a prelude to a possible public offering of debt or equity graphs different guesses about the future shows guess \?

pierre celis is about to prove you can go home again the 68yearold belgian brewer , who sold his brewery in belgium to a giant brewer several years ago , has been making beer in texas for the last year and a half now , he is going to sell beer in belgium once again regardless of whether his beers should be classified as belgianstyle texas beer or texasstyle belgian beer , there is no question that mr celis , a ross perotsize man who often wears a bolo tie , has carved out a niche for himself in the beer business he has sucessfully established himself as one of the leaders in the growing international taste for white , or wheat , beer celis beers , made in a small new brewery in austin , are sold widely in the united states but in november , celis white austin texas beer will be made and sold in belgium so no one gets the wrong idea about where mr celis s loyalties lie , the label shows a cowboy wrangling a longhorn , an attentiongetter for a country where beers are often made in monasteries light , fruity beer white beers , known as wheat beers because of the high percentage of wheat in the mash , are traditionally light and fruity they recently have been rediscovered in germany and belgium , and have caught the fancy of america s boutique brewers in the bavarian region of germany , wheat beers account for 30 percent of all beer sold belgium now has 15 brands , up from none in 1966 in america , nearly half of all microbreweries are making wheat beer , especially in the west , said david edgar , the assistant director of the institute for brewing studies in denver wheat beers account for about 10 percent of america s microbrewery production of about one million barrels with some wellknown brands like samuel adams and august schell in wide distribution america s biggest brewers have not been much for wheat in the mid80 s the miller brewing company testmarketed a germanstyle wheat beer called dakota , but found consumers were not interested and dropped it but last summer , garrett oliver , the owner of manhattan brewing company in soho , introduced a cloudy , unfiltered wheat beer and it s taken off like a rocket , he said people are very curious about it made for centuries in belgium the pale , milkylooking white beers , known as witbiers , were made for centuries , especially in and around the town of hoegaarden \( pronounced whogarden \) , near liege , where mr celis lived but the beer went out of style , and by 1957 the town s last brewer of white beer closed and sold his equipment to a museum in those days people wanted big new brand names , not these oldfashioned products , mr celis said then came the hot summer of 1966 , finding mr celis , who had gone into his father s livestock and dairy business , lamenting the disappearance of white beer , which is often considered summer beer because of its refreshing flavor when i was growing up i had worked in that brewery and i really knew what was involved in making the beer , so i decided to try to make some myself , he said 'a substantial investment' he produced 100 liters of the beer , which is made with roughly equal parts of wheat and barley and also seasoned with coriander and bitter orange peel \( wheat beers are never made entirely from wheat \) mr celis gave samples to neighbors who liked it and encouraged him at that point i got nervous , he said to continue meant making a substantial investment with about 10 , 000 , he bought a small brewery and began producing 20 barrels a year i had success so i became more daring , he said by 1978 he had bought a former lemonade factory with two dutch partners , and after converting it into a brewery , he tripled production of his hoegaarden white beer then , in 1985 the brewery was destroyed by fire it would take the equivalent of 10 million to rebuild we were not well insured , he said found willing backer but he found a willing backer in interbrew , the giant belgian brewer that owns stella artois and several other brands and commands a 14 percent share of the global market , according to impact , a research service for the beverage industry \( the anheuserbusch companies is the leader with a 9 percent share \) mr celis sold the brewery but his contract for a sevenfigure sum he will not disclose required him to remain with interbrew until 1990 , by which time the new brewery was producing 300 , 000 barrels a year and was one of 15 belgian breweries making white beer when i started , it was just me and my wife , juliette , he said and we conquered the world but conqueror or not , mr celis was by no means ready for an easy chair selling the brewery was a crisis for me , he said seven acres in texas his daughter , christine , who had worked in the brewery , and his soninlaw , peter camps , who was also a brewer , wanted to try to make belgianstyle beer in america the celises knew some people in texas , so they settled in austin they bought seven acres of land for 13 million and built their texas brewery america is a big market , mr celis said , but it s difficult for a brief period he had tried to export his belgian white beer to america , but it was too expensive you ca n't sell much beer if you have to charge 9 or 10 for a sixpack , he said last year , the brewery started by making celis white , plus a rich and hearty pale bock and a pilsenerstyle golden beer grand cru , a creamy , fruity ale , was added last december sandy monblatt , whose company , sanford trading of sausalito , calif , distributes celis beers on the west coast , said the white beer is acquiring a small but loyal following that is growing it will take time , he said people have to taste the beer to understand it daughter steps in last year when a group of 65 belgian brewers visited the brewery in austin , they suggested that mr celis export his beer to belgium that was out of the question , mr celis said , because of the 40 percent tax imposed on american products by the european economic community so his daughter arranged for a belgian brewery to make it under license surprisingly , his agreement with interbrew did not prevent him from making beer in belgium again interbrew ca n't be happy about it , but there s nothing they can do to stop us , he said photos where the white , or wheat , beer is made in his celis brewery in austin , tex , pierre celis , right , joined his daughter , christine , and her husband , peter camps the beer will soon be available in belgium \( zigy kaluzny for the new york times \) \( pg 37 \) pierre celis carved

federal and state investigators have found evidence in at least 20 states that executives at the nation s largest national and regional dairy companies have conspired sometimes for decades to rig bids on milk products sold to schools and military bases so far , 48 people and 43 companies including industry giants like borden , pet and dean foods have been convicted or have pleaded guilty to federal criminal charges of pricefixing and bidrigging at least 914 million in criminal fines and civil damages has been levied , and two dozen people have been sentenced to prison the cases follow a common pattern top regional executives arranged , usually by telephone but sometimes at gatherings at local restaurants , to divvy up the local milk business by deciding in advance who would submit the low bid for each school district and military base in their region millions in inflated profits as a result , students and military personnel , and the taxpayers who subsidize their meals , have overpaid for milk and ice cream , while dairy companies have reaped millions of dollars of artificially inflated profits in a typical case , a federal prosecutor in florida said the bidrigging had raised milk prices by 14 percent because grand jury inquiries are carried out in secret , details are not available about many of the cases but at least 32 grand juries , including panels in new jersey and connecticut , are involved in the investigation and joseph h widmar , director of operations for the justice department s antitrust division , said more prosecutions are expected we 've looked at other industries in the past , but we have n't uncovered anything like this , he said the milk investigation is the biggest his unit has conducted since the highway construction scandals of the early 1980 s , which resulted in 347 criminal cases , mr widmar said at least 50 lawyers onesixth of the division s legal staff have been assigned to pursue corruption in the milk industry among the nation s largest dairies , flavorich , based in louisville , ky , and six of its executives have pleaded guilty in seven states borden , its meadow gold subsidiary , and nine borden and meadow gold executives have admitted rigging bids in six states pet , based in st louis , and the landosun dairy unit of finevest foods in greenwich , conn , which purchased pet s dairy business in 1985 , have pleaded guilty in five states seven executives who worked for pet and landosun have also pleaded guilty the southland corporation and several top executives of its former velda farms dairy unit , along with two subsidiaries of dean foods , have pleaded guilty to rigging bids in florida and dozens of smaller regional dairies across the south , along with their top executives , have also pleaded guilty speaking for the dairy industry , e linwood tipton , president of the milk industry foundation , said he believed the industry s local problems had been exaggerated by the spotlight of the federal prosecutions and state civil suits if you put the same scrutiny on any other industry , you 'd find a significant number of cases there , too , mr tipton said when there are enormous investigatory powers directed at you , it looks like a more abnormal situation than it probably is federal investigators will not say whether they believe the bidrigging found so far was sanctioned by the top management at the large corporations that pleaded guilty citing the secrecy of grand jury investigations , mr widmar would say only , you 're going to have to look at the record and decide included in that record is a 1990 case in which a borden sales executive in florida testified that he believed the company s top managers , including a senior dairy executive , condoned the illegal practices and would protect employees who got caught the borden executive identified in the testimony , who has since retired , denied the accusation , as did lawyers for the company borden itself like all the major corporations that pleaded guilty insisted that its senior managers were completely unaware that many junior executives were ignoring company warnings about bidrigging we can speculate about why they did n't know , said allan miller , senior vice president and chief administrative officer of borden and believe me , i am frustrated that they did n't know but senior management just did not pick up on this issue at the local level as the roster of cases grows dwarfing earlier cases filed against many of the same companies in the 1960 s and 1970 s some people active in the investigation are questioning how such longrunning conspiracies could have flourished without corporate and industry leaders' awareness when you have a problem that creeps across state borders like this , you either have uppermanagement involvement or you have an uppermanagement problem , said mary sue terry , the former virginia attorney general who directed her state s bidrigging inquiry before resigning recently to run for governor first investigation was in florida
as officials grapple with the disruption in new york city s schools caused by the asbestos scandal , investigators say they have made progress in their efforts to learn who mishandled the asbestos testing and why they have also widened the focus to include fraud in other areas though the city and federal investigations remain in early stages , with criminal charges , if they come , still weeks or even months away , the investigators say they have compiled considerable evidence of wrongdoing by the unit of the board of education that conducted the asbestos testing program in the late 1980 s the investigators say the unit , the asbestos task force , which had 53 members before being disbanded last month , was negligent not only in the inspections for asbestos but also in how it handled asbestos during cleanups , possibly creating health hazards for students , teachers and other school workers pay for work not done in particular , the investigators say they have evidence that supervisors of the task force in some cases paid contractors to do work that was not needed or never done another investigator who , like the others , spoke on condition of anonymity , said that some cleanup workers , known as the flying squads because the protective gear they wore resembled space suits , exaggerated expense accounts and used official cars for personal business while secondary to the investigation , the investigator said , it s indicative of what was going on as the task force sought to comply with the federally mandated inspection and cleanup task force members , who have been reassigned to other jobs by the board of education , have refused to comment when asked the investigations began in june as two independent investigators , thomas d thacher 2d , the inspector general of the school construction authority , and edward s stancik , the special commissioner of investigation for the new york city school district , discovered that the asbestos reports required for each of the city s 1 , 069 schools were so inaccurate as to be meaningless their findings , announced on aug 6 , prompted the emergency inspection of the city s schools when that effort could not be completed by the scheduled start of classes on sept 9 , the board of education voted to delay the opening until at least sept 20 major asbestos found the emergency inspection continued yesterday at a frantic pace as of yesterday , inspectors had declared safe and ready only 59 schools out of 1 , 069 also yesterday , officials identified one school , public school 4 in the bronx , as having major exposed asbestos throughout the building , in plaster walls and ceilings until yesterday , there had been only one other such school , public school 133 in brooklyn , which last month was identified as having major levels of asbestos records are missing the investigations now under way by mr thacher , mr stancik , the united states attorneys in brooklyn and manhattan , the federal bureau of investigation and the district attorney of queens are trying to determine how the asbestos reports could be so inaccurate as to be meaningless , whether inspectors lied on the reports and why vital records of samples are missing they have also focused on the awarding of the asbestos contract to the consultant , envirosafe inc , as well as on the labs the company used to analyze its samples the consultant was hired to oversee the entire effort the investigators have declined to discuss their progress publicly , except to say that the investigation continues as they sift through reams of documents seized from the headquarters of the asbestos task force and interview scores of former and current employees the task force was divided into three divisions the inspectors who carried out the federally mandated tests , the flying squads and technical support staff and the supervisors the inspectors filed the reports at the center of the scandal , but so far investigators say they have not established that the inaccuracies were the result of fraud one official close to the investigation , however , said significant progress had been made in recent weeks , with a possible breakthrough coming as some members of the task force agreed to cooperate with investigators in one case , an investigator said , they had found evidence that the supervisors hired a contractor to remove exposed asbestos from a school that had none , since it was built after asbestos building materials were no longer used in another case , investigators said , the supervisors paid three contractors to remove asbestos from a single school , which inspectors later discovered still had large amounts of exposed asbestos asbestos in the schools where to call with the public school year

irvingtononhudson the gently tinkling sounds of the handbells , usually used in temple services , mingled with the haunting tones of a classical sitar , as a group of eight indian youngsters ranging in age from 5 through 13 sat in a semicircle around their instructor while she led them in a traditional indian music class as chander kala ahuja , a specialeducation montessori teacher from scarsdale , played a harmonium , her young students accompanied her with hindustani chants and rhythmic beating of the tabla , a pairof small drums that look like bongo drums i want to communicate my culture , said mrs ahuja , a former music teacher from new delhi who wore a shimmering fuchsia sari this is what we have , and we should do more and more of it music is very important in indian education i really enjoy this music , added one of her older students , amala ankolekar , a junior at briarcliff high school who came for an adult music class it s part of my culture and provides part of my identity the setting was the elegantly contemporary irvington home of dr shishir bhattacharya , an obstetriciangynecologist who practices in ardsley , and his wife , sumita the sounds belied the frozen , wintry backdrop outside instead , the tunes spun images of the sunny , colorful landscape of their native india the bhattacharyas s effort to pass along their cultural heritage to their children , a 7yearold daughter and 5yearold son , through such classes as mrs ahuja s , reflects a growing desire on the part of the members of westchester s indian community to maintain their identity even as they assimilate successfully into the larger american society a sense of belonging a few years ago , i think the indian community was more hidden because people were mostly interested in setting themselves up professionally , said dr bhattacharya , who is meeting with other indians in the county to explore the possibility of opening a community center in which to hold social activities , celebrate festivals and offer indian cultural classes now that we 've achieved what we had to achieve , we can network more socially and communicate our culture to our children , dr bhattacharya said none of these children speak hindi , but as they learn the songs and listen to the words , they are learning the language what we are trying to do is give them a sense of belonging , of where they come from once they know their base , we hope it will make for stronger people and more tolerant people as the indian community in westchester becomes more established , those who have lived here for more than a decade are able to look outward to the rest of their community and work toward strengthening their children s dual identities as indians and americans mainly professionals with 10 , 000 people residing primarily in the lower westchester communities of ardsley , briarcliff , chappaqua , dobbs ferry , edgemont , irvington , larchmont , new rochelle , scarsdale , tarrytown , white plains and yonkers , the county s indian population is more extensive and diffuse than most people s encounters with local convenience store owners and gas station operators might suggest in contrast with the japanese and korean communities , which tend to congregate in certain areas because of language or cultural constraints , the indian population appears less dependent on compatriots when it comes to choosing a neighborhood unlike the recent waves of indian immigrants that have settled in flushing , queens , and edison township , nj , westchester s indian community is predominantly professional , represented by doctors , pharmacists , engineers , dentists and business executives this group reflects the wave of immigrants who came to the united states from india in the 1970 s , when discrimination in britain and barriers to immigration there emerged many members of the indian community in westchester came to pursue postgraduate studies and then remained , pleased with the professional and financial opportunities available others settled first in immigrant communities in new york city and were later attracted to the county by its reputation for excellent schools and diversity and the convenient commute to midtown manhattan the prime reason is schools , said veena kumar of white plains , the mother of three her husband , sunil , added i 've traveled around the country quite a bit , and find that westchester is very tolerant and cosmopolitan but since real estate is expensive in westchester , that makes the indian community more homogeneous mr kumar is an analyst with first boston in manhattan what also distinguishes the westchester indian community from its counterparts in new york city and new jersey is the tolerance and diversity within the indian community itself the political conflicts that are played out in india between sikh \( a monotheistic hindu sect \) and hindu or moslem and hindu are not transplanted here people who may have come from different sections of india live as neighbors here and socialize together the majority of the sikhs' customers are nonsikh indians , said dr bhattacharya , a hindu , whose partner is a moslem from india
the infinite plan by isabel allende translated by margaret sayers peden 382 pages harpercollins 23 in her latest novel , the infinite plan , isabel allende abandons the hot , politically turbulent latin american milieu of her earlier fiction for a generic american setting she also exchanges the strong , beautiful heroines of the house of the spirits and eva luna for a prideful , strutting male protagonist and trades in the softly accented magical realism of such previous books for a more leadenfooted brand of naturalism this results in a bildungsromancumfamily saga that owes more to judith krantz than to gabriel garcia marquez the hero of the infinite plan is one gregory reeves , the son of an itinerant preacher and prophet , who travels through america like a benign version of david koresh , trying to win converts to the infinite plan a vague , quasireligious doctrine of destiny and salvation when gregory s father falls ill , the family gives up its nomadic existence and takes up residence in the hispanic barrio of los angeles there , gregory is a misfit , a white boy who is threatened and mocked by gang members and neighborhood bullies as the years pass , gregory watches his family slowly unravel his ailing father turns increasingly hostile and demented his mother withdraws further and further into a dream world his sister , judy , grows fat , sullen and angry a local couple , pedro and immaculada morales , gradually become gregory s surrogate parents their daughter , carmen , becomes his soul mate and best friend gregory , himself , suffers through the usual pains of adolescence girls , hormones , doubts about who he is and who he wants to be he finds a succession of mentors olga , an old family friend , takes him to bed and instructs him in the art of sex cyrus , a committed communist who runs the elevator at the public library , teaches him about politics and history from here , ms allende plunges her hero into a succession of adventures that are meant to make gregory a kind of representative man , a symbol of his generation s spiritual and political peregrinations there s an interlude in berkeley and san francisco that gives ms allende a chance to describe drugtaking hippies and braburning feminists , followed by a stint in vietnam , which gives her a chance to describe firefights and jungle showdowns with snipers none of these events are conjured up with the least bit of originality or felt emotion rather , they feel like trite , secondhand orchestrations of old magazine stories and pulp fiction of the 1960 s , ms allende writes it was a time of great changes and continuing surprises the novelty of free love , for so many years kept under lock and key , spread rapidly , and what had begun as another hippie fantasy became the favorite parlor game of the bourgeoisie of soldiers on an randr holiday , she writes filthy , adrenaline flowing , as one man , a family of desperadoes , they threw themselves like animals on the icecold beer and sizzling hamburgers , which they had n't seen in months , and when someone tried to remind them of canteen regulations , they raised a storm that nearly degenerated into another slaughter gregory s reasons for going to vietnam are explained in the tritest of terms i came because of hemingway , in search of my manhood , the myth of the macho , the definition of masculinity , pride in the muscles and endurance i acquired during training , wanting to prove my valor because at heart i have always suspected i am a coward and to prove my fortitude because i was sick of being betrayed by my feelings a late rite of passage his reasons for later embracing the yuppie pursuit of success are announced in equally corny terms i'm going to have true power money and prestige something i never saw in the barrio then no one can look down on me or raise his voice to me given the way things happen in sagas like this , it s not long before gregory has indeed become a highpowered lawyer , who spends even more money than he earns his success , naturally , has not brought him the happiness and security he craves there are two lousy marriages the first to a nitwit debutante who does nothing but play tennis the second to a vapid secretary who later becomes a model gregory s children from both these marriages are a mess his daughter becomes a drug addict and prostitute his son is an uncontrollable brat , attended to by a phalanx of doctors and shrinks throughout these travails , gregory commiserates with his childhood friend carmen who after years of drift and confusion , has come into her own with a thriving jewelry business filling out the stories of gregory and carmen are the tales of a multicultural supporting cast gregory s devoted chinese accountant his amazingly competent black housekeeper his intelligent chinese therapist , and carmen s adopted vietnamese son none of these people are described in anything but the shallowest of cliches gregory s housekeeper is actually described as 200 pounds of beautiful , cheerful black womanhood , pure gleaming chocolate none of them lend the infinite plan the faintest glimmer of authenticity the reader struggles to find positive things to say about this novel the story of carmen s journey from loneliness to love , from the dangerous streets of the los angeles barrio to the poshest neighborhoods of rome , possesses some of the heartfelt emotion that gregory s story does not , and ms allende keeps us continually wondering whether gregory and carmen will ever become a couple such elements , however , are insufficient to sustain what is , in the end , a disappointing and mechanical novel photo of isabel allende

and rhyming games among those who stayed in her spare bedroom were katherine anne porter and eudora welty the executive branch of the united states government and the foreign affairs departments of

insights out of incidents mrs winslow s book is a collection of her affectionate letters to her motherinlaw , the writer anne goodwin winslow , who later returned them with the hope that they would be used as material for an autobiography but rather than write one , marcella winslow has only reprinted the letters complete with thanks for presents , reports on household repairs , cute remarks by the

that what they are doing at parties is not relaxation , but vitally important work
geneva , jan 3 the leaders of the bosnian adversaries in the republic s fratricidal war met face to face today for the first time since the conflict began nine months ago radovan karadzic , leader of the serbian nationalists who have seized twothirds of bosnia and herzegovina , and bosnia s muslim president , alija izetbegovic , talked for more than three hours afterward , cyrus r vance , cochairman of the conference on the former yugoslavia , said , i think we have made considerable progress but mr izetbegovic said there had been no progress mr karadzic , who emerged smiling , said , if we make mutual concessions , it will be resolved their discussion focused on how and whether to divide bosnia and herzegovina on the basis of a plan presented on saturday to all the combatants by mr vance and lord owen of britain , the other cochairman the main element is a proposal to split bosnia into 10 provinces muslims would predominate in three of these , serbs in one , and power would be shared in five by muslims and croats or muslims and serbs the 10th region would include sarajevo , which would be declared an open city the bosnian adversaries met on the second day of discussions among the five parties involved in the war their talks are being mediated by mr vance , the united nations envoy and a former secretary of state , and lord owen , the european community envoy and a former british foreign secretary on saturday , though mr karadzic and mr izetbegovic were in the same room with the other leaders , they did not speak to each other mr izetbegovic has called mr karadzic a genocidal war criminal the karadzic forces are besieging sarajevo , where nearly 400 , 000 people are trying to survive the winter with little food , water , heat or electricity differing accounts this afternoon , however , lord owen , emerging from hall no 8 of the sprawling palace of nations , where mr karadzic and mr izetbegovic were conferring , said , in terms of personality , it was quite good , the way they talked to each other but he added , in terms of detail it is quite difficult , going into every bloody village and arguing over them mr vance said that agreement had been reached on 7 of the 10 proposed provinces and that there were no heated arguments on either side it was not immediately clear why his assessment differed so markedly from that of mr izetbegovic , but united nations officials said the bosnian president s public comments contrasted sharply with his style in the negotiating sessions they said he has been under pressure from some in his government to adopt a belligerent stance , but mr izetbegovic has told confidants here that he wants to stop the bloodshed mr karadzic s assessment was similar to mr vance s the serb said differences remained over three provinces , one in the extreme northeast and two in the east asked about his feelings toward mr izetbegovic , he said they knew each other well from two years of meetings before the war i do n't feel hate or anger toward him , he said we are all unfortunate that we live in this terrible spot on the earth both said earlier in the day that the initial vanceowen map was unacceptable in mr izetbegovic s view , it did not provide enough provinces where muslims would predominate mr karadzic complained that the serbianled territories were not contiguous it is a basis for negotiations , mr izetbegovic said , but it needs many , many corrections tonight , the mediators circulated new map proposals with adjustments intended to meet some of the objections while the karadzicizetbegovic meeting was the most dramatic of the day , there were other twoparty discussions in which sharp differences arose one of these was between mate boban , leader of the bosnian croats and mr izetbegovic , over whose people ought to dominate a northern province there was , however , agreement between presidents franjo tudjman of croatia and dobrica cosic of the truncated yugoslav federation serbia and montenegro that bosnia should be reconstituted as a confederation of muslim , serb and croat territories that concept is opposed by mr vance and lord owen the negotiations are to continue monday and then pause on tuesday until the weekend bush and mitterrand agree paris , jan 3 \( special to the new york times \) president bush and president francois mitterrand said today that they had agreed on the military means to stop serbian flights over bosnia , but they ruled out any decision on armed intervention until the geneva talks are concluded after meeting for two hours , the two leaders repeatedly stressed a shared approach to the balkan conflict with pressure mounting on both to move beyond what is widely seen as ineffective diplomacy , president mitterrand said that we agreed on the means to enforce a flight ban on serbia a ban on military flights over bosnia was declared by the united nations security council in october , but has been flouted by serbian forces the security council is contemplating a resolution that would threaten military strikes to stop the flights today mr bush said , france and the united states are very close together on the nofly zone enforcement , and i expect that it could be passed fairly soon together , france and britain have 7 , 400 troops with the international force in former yugoslav republics , while the united states has none american efforts to secure an explicit threat of force against serbia from the security council have until recently been met with reticence from the europeans , who fear for the safety of their ground troops but in the face of continued serbian attacks , these differences seem to have diminished photo nearly 400 , 000 people are trying to survive the winter in sarajevo with little food , water , heat or

troy , mich , june 29 five of the country s top college players sat in a hotel conference room today , nervously contemplating their fate in wednesday night s national basketball association draft would n't you be nervous \? asked jamal mashburn , the university of kentucky star who is expected to be among the top four picks you could end up on one coast , or another you do n't know what s going to happen , until it happens it happens wednesday night , when the speculation finally ends and the draft begins at the palace of auburn hills chris webber , the player expected to be the no 1 pick , joined shawn bradley , j r rider , calbert cheaney , and mashburn at a news conference today but none of the players could answer for certain the one question they were asked most often where do you think you will be selected \? the orlando magic , owners of the no 1 pick , are expected to take webber , teaming him with center shaquille o'neal to form an imposing frontcourt combination it has been speculated for weeks that orlando might trade the pick , particularly to golden state , which owns the no 3 pick and covets either bradley or webber but the magic must be careful in trading for more highpriced players because of salarycap problems so unless a lastminute threeway deal develops , webber appears headed for disney world and webber sounded confident enough to handle the pressure that comes with being drafted no 1 maybe this is a cocky attitude , but i feel that if you do n't pick me , you 're missing out , said webber , a 6foot9inch player who decided to enter the draft after his sophomore season at michigan i would love to play for orlando , i'm not going to lie but there are a lot of good players in here , and none of us have to brownnose to be picked on a team we 're all good , we 've all proven ourselves if jamal gets the first pick , i'm just going to say , 'well , they missed out on me' but they ca n't go wrong with jamal they ca n't go wrong with me they ca n't go wrong with shawn bradley orlando s general manager , pat williams , has added to the suspense by playing it coy , like a man who knows he has the best hand in a game of poker williams has admitted the thought of a twintowers front line of o'neal \( 7 feet \) and bradley \( 76 \) intrigues him williams has not even ruled out taking mashburn but the odds are in webber s favor , mainly because scouts believe he has the versatility to make an immediate impact and to become a star nothing can be gained by making a public pronouncement about our plans , williams said tonight we 've been listening to teams , and we 're going to keep listening right up until the deadline we 're going to have to live with this pick or our decision for the next 10 to 12 years , so we 're weighing everything carefully bradley , the favorite to be chosen no 2 , by the philadelphia 76ers , is the draft s biggest curiosity having spent the last two years on a mormon mission in australia , bradley will enter the league untested by recent game competition bradley said he weighed 245 pounds and that he would spend the summer working on his endurance and strength but during his one season at brigham young , where he averaged 148 points , 77 rebounds , and 52 blocked shots , bradley led the nation in blocked shots and showed admirable agility for a player his size and bradley appears to be every inch of 76 at one point today , bradley stood next to bob lanier , the former allstar center who was listed at 611 bradley towered over lanier by at least six inches 'my hunger and desire are back' whether i have an incredible impact on the game , or whether i'm a flop , giving 100 percent is all i can do , said bradley a basketball was the first baby toy i had having two years off and being able to put things in perspective helped me realize how much i love the game my hunger and desire are back the skills are there it will just take a couple of months to get them back webber believes bradley is a norisk pick it will take shawn one game to have an impact , webber said i 've played against him in camps two years have n't hurt him he s agile , he can run the floor he s not a project he s right now i think he 'll have an instant impact in the league should webber and bradley be chosen 12 , the warriors appear to be torn between choosing mashburn or anfernee hardaway , a 67 guard from memphis state the dallas mavericks , at no 4 , are expected to take either mashburn or hardaway , depending on which player remains however , there is a very slim chance that the mavericks' new coach , quinn buckner , an indiana graduate , might be tempted to take hoosier star cheaney that move would really throw the draft in a new direction sam schuler , the warriors' director of player personnel , said the arthroscopic knee surgery that golden state forward billy owens had on monday would have no impact on how the warriors would draft schuler admitted that the warriors were still having conversations with orlando and other teams , trying to work out a threeway deal to move up in the draft we 're doing what every team in the league is doing talking and trying to make a wise basketball decision , schuler said our needs are for a big player if we were fortunate enough to move up to no 1 , you could make a case that either webber or bradley would fit in with us at that point , we 'd have to make a decision if the warriors keep the no 3 pick , have they decided whether to pick mashburn or hardaway \? i think we 've reached a decision , but you do n't expect me to tell you , do you \? schuler said , laughing more magic than money if the magic take webber , current orlando players dennis scott or brian williams may have to be traded to create room under the salary cap for webber asked if he would accept less money from the magic than he would from another team , webber said i'm going to let people who have all the knowledge of the business take care of that i do n't want to be a bad guy and say , 'i want this , i want that' really , i do n't even want to know what they 're asking for some people might think that s naive , but if you have common sense , at these salaries , you should be able to live well for a long time and i think i have common sense i do n't want to get caught up in the figures i do n't know if i 'll have to sit out i just want to make sure that whatever i get , i'm worth it if webber , bradley , mashburn and hardaway are the first four picks , the next picks could fall like this rider at no 5 \( minnesota \) cheaney at no 6 \( washington \) , bobby hurley at no 7 \( sacramento \) , rodney rogers at no 8 \( milwaukee \) vin baker at no 9 \( denver \) acie earl at no 10 \( detroit \) allan houston at no 11 \( detroit \) and lindsey hunter at no 12 \( los angeles lakers \) scouts are divided on what will happen after that , because this year s draft is not nearly as deep as last year s , when solid players like hubert davis \( no 20 \) , oliver miller \( no 22 \) , and latrell sprewell \( no 24 \) went late in the first round everything will be much clearer by late wednesday night photo five of the leading prospects in tonight s nba draft posing yesterday in troy , mich from left to right , unlv s j r rider , indiana s calbert cheaney , brigham young s shawn bradley , michigan s chris webber and kentucky s jamal mashburn \( associated press \) \( pg b15 \)
the baltimore orioles , replacing the yankees as the american league east s most aggressive pursuer of free agents , snared sid fernandez for their pitching staff yesterday but stumbled in their quest to make will clark their first baseman clark instead replaced rafael palmeiro as the texas rangers' first baseman fernandez , whom the mets made little effort to resign after a 10year association , agreed to a threeyear contract worth 9 million the rangers , who had offered palmeiro 265 million for five years , gave clark 30 million for five the orioles had been close to reaching agreement with clark on a fiveyear , 30 million deal , negotiating with clark s agent , jeff moorad , through the weekend but the talks ended at about 5 30 am yesterday they broke down , according to three people familiar with the negotiations , after peter angelos , the orioles' new owner , got involved and the deal shrank to 275 million , moorad then called the texas rangers and , while sitting in his baltimore hotel room , concluded an agreement with them the deal calls for a 2 million signing bonus and salaries of 4 million , 575 million , 6 million , 6 million and 625 million clark , 29 , played for the san francisco giants the first eight years of his major league career and was their most glamorous player until they signed barry bonds as a free agent a year ago the giants let clark leave rather than offer him a contract longer than three years orioles may eye murray having lost their chance for clark , the orioles were pondering the possibility of pursuing palmeiro angelos , who led a group that bought the orioles for 173 million in a bankruptcy court auction , was said to be interested in signing eddie murray , also a free agent , to return to the club as its first baseman gene michael , the yankees' general manager , spoke yesterday with palmeiro s agent , jim bronner the yankees have thoughts of using palmeiro in right field michael , who has been trying to obtain a topflight pitcher in a trade , also explained the yankees' apparent lack of interest in the handful of decent starting pitchers available in the freeagent market mark portugal , formerly of houston , accepted a threeyear , 11 million offer from the giants on sunday if i had gone to the freeagent market first and then not been able to sign anybody , i would 've had to go back to the drawing board , michael said i 'd rather get one of the pitchers in a trade i did n't want to pass up the trading and go to the freeagent market the orioles , rangers and cleveland indians were the fernandez finalists the mets never were a factor , having offered the 31yearold lefthander only a oneyear contract for 25 million with 1 million in unspecified bonuses and an option year for an unspecified salary when he goes out to the mound , he s one of the best pitchers in baseball , joe mcilvaine , the mets' top baseball executive , said but if you look at his physical record for the last four years , it s difficult to commit that kind of money over a long period we had to exercise some financial sensibility fernandez defends health fernandez was shortcircuited by a series of injuries in recent seasons , but none was related to his pitching he suffered torn cartilage in each knee , and a batted ball fractured his left wrist people think i'm one of the walking wounded , but that s not true , fernandez said in a conference call asked if he had any ill feelings toward the mets , he said no , no , no i had nine great years by the mets i did n't feel unappreciated i guess i just was n't in their plans for the future on opening day i had a hunch i did n't fit in with the plans of the mets' future i do n't know why i just had that feeling the indians , who also tried unsuccessfully to sign portugal , made an offer to fernandez similar to the one presented by the orioles but the orioles , fernandez said , were the first team to contact him and the team that showed the most interest the presentation , the stadium , the people , the manager were the persuasive elements , he explained the orioles gave fernandez a 1 million signing bonus and salaries of 3 million , 2 million and 3 million the salaries in the last two years can rise by the amount of any bonuses fernandez earns the previous season , based on innings pitched he can earn 250 , 000 each for pitching 200 and 250 innings the departure of fernandez , coming three days after howard johnson signed with the colorado rockies , leaves dwight gooden as the only player left from the mets' 1988 division championship team but the loss of fernandez , a type a free agent , and johnson , a type b player , gives the mets three extra draft choices in the early rounds of june s amateur draft by the time they use the rockies' secondround spot as the seventh team selecting , the mets will have drafted five players one of their own in each of the first two rounds , the orioles' firstround pick , the rockies' secondround selection and a choice between the first two rounds i think we have to go with kids , mcilvaine said , discussing the club s rebuilding plans and a desire to amass draft choices and not lose any i do n't see us going after a and b players if i was going to sacrifice one year , this would be it to get in shape for a run in '95 barring trades , mcilvaine said , the mets' starting rotation next season will be gooden , bret saberhagen , bobby jones and two others from among pete schourek , eric hillman and anthony young we would anticipate there would be some moves made in that context , but we have until april to get that done , he said the rangers tried to sign fernandez because they are looking for one more established starter but for yesterday , at least , they settled for an established starting first baseman in replacing a mississippi state teammate , clark , based on his recent performance , will be hardpressed to replace the 37 home runs and 105 runs batted in palmeiro produced for the rangers last season clark hit 14 home runs and had 73 rbi for the giants some baseball people speculated that clark put too much pressure on himself trying to match bonds if that is true , clark could rebound with a significantly better season in the rangers' new park

at this late date , it would seem there is little left to say about seatbelts they are old technology , well proven as the most important safety item in an automobile , and they have been required in american cars for more than 25 years but accidents involving sports figures two of them in the last week show that america still has a lot to learn first , there was the california crash that seriously injured basketball star bobby hurley when he was thrown through the passenger window of his toyota 4runner and then there was the accident that not only killed the best friend of houston oilers defensive tackle jeff alm but apparently led to alm s suicide a short time later neither hurley nor alm s friend , sean p lynch , had fastened their seatbelts , and that failure caused them to be pitched violently to the road further , seven teenagers who had squeezed into a honda civic were killed in cadiz , ky , wednesday when the car ran headon into a sportutility vehicle none of the boys was wearing a seatbelt the incidents , tragic as they are , are not isolated , of course , and department of transportation figures show that a mere 62 percent of american drivers use seatbelts , as required by most states new york was the first to enact such a law , and it has been followed by 41 other states and the nation s capital unfortunately , penalties are slight , ranging from nothing for a first offense in mississippi to 47 in the state of washington all the same , the government estimates that 5 , 226 lives were saved by seatbelts last year that compares with an estimate of 300 lives saved by air bags , an invaluable device but one whose public attention detracts from the overriding importance of belts air bags , in fact , are designed to work in conjunction with seatbelts , which hold occupants in place and position them so the bags can do their job in 1992 , about 55 percent of occupants involved in fatal accidents were unrestrained , according to federal figures , and 74 percent of the occupants who were thrown from cars were killed seatbelts just make very good sense , and they first appeared in america s automobiles at the turn of the century for the next 10 years , they were a popular option , not because of a fear of accidents there were few other cars to run into but because the roads were so bad that occupants bounced out of the open vehicles later , they were applied to airplanes , and pilots installed the straps to keep themselves from falling out during upsidedown maneuvers then , in 1920 , barney oldfield put the first belt into a race car , and other racers followed america s first factoryinstalled seatbelts appeared in the 1950 nash statesman and ambassador models , fondly known by auto buffs as the bathtub nashes , but the option took a long time to catch on in the mid60 s , the government required seatbelt anchors in new cars , and full installation was mandated as of january 1968 in 1973 , general motors offered air bags as an option , but the project was a commercial failure and it was n't until 1984 that air bags again got serious attention that was the year that mercedesbenz offered the bags , accompanied by seatbelts with pyrotechnic pretensioners the tensioners use the same sensors and other technology involved in airbag deployment , and they take up slack that is naturally present in the belts tom baloga , manager of safety engineering for mercedesbenz of north america , said seatbelt technology has improved over the years , and he pointed out that one of the more important facets is in making the belts more comfortable and easier to use he said , too , that the fatality rate is currently at a low , with 18 deaths for 100 million miles traveled that s the lowest in history , even though people are driving more , he said , noting that the statistics can be attributed to a growing awareness of the value of seatbelts i'm sure that every car company agrees that the belt is the most important safety feature in the car , baloga added you want people to use them because you want people to be protected you want them to survive , obviously , and hopefully not to get hurt at all in terms of getting people to buckle up , he said , the manufacturers have two responsibilities , first in touting the value of belts and then in making them as comfortable and efficient as possible we need to accommodate people whether they are short or tall or thin or large , he said height adjustments are important for the shoulder belt , and mercedes was the first to put it into cars back in 1980 another thing , he said , is that belts must be worn properly there is a very serious problem out there where people put the shoulder belts under their arm , baloga said that s very dangerous you are putting all the load on your chest and ribs , which are n't designed to take it but if there is one thing to say about seatbelts , he said , it is this wear 'em drawings seatbelt pretensioners were part of the system when mercedes introduced air bags in 1984 \( mercedesbenz of north america \) in 1950 , nash was the first to offer factoryinstalled seatbelts as an option
pairing eric overmyer s linguistic virtuosity with scott joplin s scintillating syncopation sounds like a promising theatrical idea as it turns out , the heliotrope bouquet by scott joplin and louis chauvin , the work that results from this crosscentury partnership , vitiates the efforts of both the playwright and the composer this is a dreary , downbeat attempt at musical biography in his play \( at playwrights horizons \) , mr overmyer barely taps joplin s extraordinary life the story of how this itinerant turnofthecentury musician moved out of saloons and bawdy houses and became the king of ragtime is told more evocatively in the 1950 book they all played ragtime , by rudi blesh and harriet janis , and there is also an interesting historical collage of facts and photographs in the lobby of the theater at the center of the play is the relationship between joplin and chauvin , a younger composer who never achieved the vogue of his friend and rival the heliotrope bouquet was their single published musical collaboration unwisely , the author delays their story and begins his play near the end of joplin s life when he is wasting away in a harlem rooming house then , in stock dramatic fashion , the character is transported back in his mind and dreams to a presumably headier time when he is emerging along with the music of ragtime ghosts come and go and at various points harangue the protagonist the dialogue has none of the flair of mr overmyer s other plays , such as on the verge , native speech the flaws of the play are magnified in joe morton s production as performed within the confines of richard hoover s explodedpiano set design , the production strikes a dour note and holds to it as portrayed by delroy lindo , joplin remains enervated even when he returns to his youth mr lindo , who was so sharp as west indian archie in the movie malcolm x , misses the jauntiness needed to give joplin a life onstage around him are actors equally unyielding in their attempts at individualizing their characters and communicating the vibrancy of the ragtime era only duane boutte as chauvin has a modicum of success the clunkiest actors have been given the show s few dances the minimal choreography is by louis johnson , who was much more forthcoming in the dance numbers he staged for the broadway production of joplin s opera treemonisha the evening s musicality is left in the hands of terry waldo , who plays a brief selection of joplin rags on the piano , including maple leaf rag and the title song in this respect , mr waldo stands in for mr lindo , who does not play an instrument this is in direct contrast to guy davis , who plays the title role and the guitar in robert johnson trick the devil , a far more imaginative musical biography at the new federal theater joplin s music publisher , john stark , called the song the heliotrope bouquet audible poetry of motion onstage at playwrights horizons , there is neither poetry nor motion the heliotrope bouquet by scott joplin and louis chauvin by eric overmyer , based on a libretto by mr overmyer from an idea of roger trefousse directed by joe morton set by richard hoover costumes by judy dearing lighting by phillip monat sound by bruce odland piano arrangements by terry waldo production stage manager , lloyd davis jr associate artistic director nicholas martin production manager , david a milligan dances choreographed by louis johnson presented by playwrights horizons , don scardino , artistic director paul s daniels , executive director at 416 west 42d street , clinton joplin delroy lindo spanish mary , lottie and belle donna biscoe hannah tonye patano spice amber kain joy lisa arrindell felicity kim yancey trick john and disappearing sam ramon moses turpin mike hodge keeler steve harris chauvin duane boutte stark herb foster photo delroy lindo , standing , and duane boutte in a scene from the heliotrope bouquet by scott joplin and louis chauvin \( martha swope \)
on the long bus ride to canton technical college in upstate new york , where q'hana gethers will soon start classes , she picked at the sack lunch prepared by her grandmother and stared out the window at the unfamiliar countryside i do n't want to go , she said suddenly , though she has strived for years to get there she was headed for an orientation weekend at a school she had never seen , a weekend that was supposed to help urban freshmen particularly black and hispanic students from the new york city area not be as shocked when they get here in the fall , says kahan sablo , coordinator of the college s office of multicultural affairs some of the surprises are simple , like seeing cows for the first time others are more complicated , like being in a largely white town in the heavily agricultural north country near the canadian border q'hana \( pronounced keeahna \) gethers , 18 , has already seen cows and has been determined to get to college since two philanthropists adopted her sixthgrade class in one of the poorest neighborhoods of mount vernon in westchester county , pledging tuition money through the i have a dream foundation for a child from a middleclass family , intelligence , desire and guaranteed tuition would probably make the trip to college a smooth one but ms gethers had to do a lot more to earn her seat on the bus a strongwilled , smallboned young woman with a little girl s voice and a nearly permanent smile , she has already overcome a home life she describes as hectic , with no supervision she has studied hard , built a social life around her church and , seeking order rather than freedom , moved in with her grandmother , dorothy tilghman , to avoid the drugs and crime that dominated street life in the old neighborhood , where she lived over a pool hall now that college is almost a reality , the challenges of the unknown world suddenly seem overwhelming the one familiar presence will be her 19yearold brother , terrence gethers , also a firstyear student and another beneficiary of the i have a dream program but mr gethers could n't come along for orientation weekend he spent the summer in a juvenile detention center after being arrested on an attempted robbery charge he has further to go than his sister and his situation underlines the harsh reality that money from philanthropists does n't guarantee that your life will stay on course despite her scholarship , ms gethers still worries about money at the port authority , where incoming freshmen have met to take the chartered bus to canton , she started to buy a copy of seventeen magazine and then stopped herself too expensive on the bus , she produced a shopping list of 68 items that she thought she would need , from curtains to thermal underwear , a list that a cousin painstakingly copied over in pretty handwriting but then she said , i think i 'll make do with the stuff i already have years of selfimposed isolation , keeping to myself , not going outside have helped ms gethers get this far i'm still keeping to myself , she said resolutely , as much to herself as to anyone if someone asks me a question i 'll answer them and that s it but the defenses against urban hazards have also made her tentative about entering the wider world of college along with the usual uncertainties of any young person striking out on their own , \( do n't all these people look bigger than me \? \) she was also a little nervous about navigating the unaccustomed terrain of a small , rural and largely white community the school has 2 , 200 students and a 10 percent minority enrollment on the bus trip , the president of student government talked about the difficulties of adjusting to rural culture but a video of naked gun 2 1 2 was playing on six overhead screens , and ms gethers was one of the few passengers who seemed to be paying much attention to the outside surroundings there is nothing here , she said , gazing in alarm at the cornfields and yes , grazing holsteins nothing ! i want to see buildings , houses , corporations when the bus finally pulled into canton , population 11 , 568 , she busied herself gathering trash from the floor and when she arrived on campus , on the banks of the grasse river , she panicked i'm staying on the bus , she said i do n't think i'm ready for college i'm serious just inside the doorway of heritage hall , mr sablo was waiting to greet the nearly silent group did you all see enough cows \? at an evening reception , student volunteers tried to get the new arrivals to talk most affected boredom , shyly hugging their knees or staring into their plates of chicken wings and brownies despite her earlier resolve , ms gethers is the first to risk a conversation beyond inquiries about high schools and hometowns did you go to your prom \? she asked the guy seated next to her on the floor nah , he said a lot of boys at our school did n't go either , she went on , gamely you want to see my prom pictures \? and suddenly , the heavy attitude evaporated as the group passed around the polaroids , commenting on her dress , her hair , her boyfriend
in a wild chase through upper manhattan during rush hour last night , a man driving a stolen jeep struck a pedestrian , dragged her nearly 10 blocks , careened into a city bus and collided with a police car before he finally came to a halt , the police said police officers began pursuing the driver near 135th street and lenox terrace , but as he headed south in heavy traffic , the police called off their chase to avoid risking injury to pedestrians the driver traveled as far south as 106th street , and once he headed north again on amsterdam avenue , it was he , not the police cars , that struck and critically injured a woman the driver was identified early this morning as moses rodriguez , 19 , of bushwick avenue , brooklyn sgt tina mohrmann , a police spokeswoman , said he is likely to be charged with assault , grand larceny , criminal possession of stolen property , resisting arrest , leaving the scene of an accident , and driving with a suspended license sergeant mohrmann said it was not known early this morning how many times mr rodriguez s licence had been suspended the pedestrian , initially identified by the police only as a woman in her early 20 s , was taken to st luke sroosevelt hospital center she was listed in critical condition and was in danger of losing a leg , sergeant mohrmann said sergeant mohrmann was still trying to piece together the full sequence of events early this morning she said the chase apparently began at 6 49 pm when police officers noticed a man driving a jeep at 135th street and lenox terrace that fit the description of a vehicle that had been reported stolen but the police called off their pursuit of the jeep after the police car became stuck in traffic , and the jeep driver was seen driving onto the sidewalk , endangering pedestrians police department policy specifies that officers should not engage in highspeed chases on crowded streets unless it involves a serious matter , more serious than a stolen vehicle , sergeant morhmann said the car sped east and then west through several streets in upper manhattan , and sergeant mohrmann said that other police officers apparently resumed the chase shortly afterward , once the jeep struck a woman on amsterdam avenue near 110th street the woman somehow became trapped beneath the jeep and was dragged nearly 10 blocks before she finally became dislodged between 119th and 120th streets , and witnesses said she rolled more than a dozen yards before she came to a stop it was not immediately clear exactly how the woman became trapped under the jeep but one witness said both of her arms could be seen sticking out from beneath the jeep s front bumper as it sped up amsterdam avenue , and a second witness said the woman s limbs were badly mangled the leg was broken , the leg was completely gone , said orlando ferrer , a doorman at a building on amsterdam avenue and 120th street , who saw the woman as just after she was dislodged the left arm also looked like it was going to come off blood was running down her face she s lucky she s still alive police car struck the driver , apparently determined to avoid the police cars again in pursuit , continued up amsterdam avenue and turned right on 125th street , witnesses said when the driver was confronted by a police car coming toward him on 125th street , he swerved to try to avoid it , and instead struck the side of a bus with about 20 passengers on board none were seriously hurt , the police said a police car in close pursuit of the jeep then collided with it , witnesses said sergeant mohrmann said that the two officers inside the car were treated for minor injuries the jeep was really speeding , said a young man who saw it pass the corner of 125th street and amsterdam avenue , shortly before it crashed i thought it would spin out of control
to the editor we in australia follow your health care debate with great interest we too are confronted with increasing demands and shrinking resources , new and expensive technology , higher wages and an aging population with increased expectations we do not have a perfect system , but all have access to care , medical and surgical , regardless of ability to pay we have waiting lists in public hospitals , and our facilities are strained what is of surprise to us is that you spend proportionately more of your gross national product on health care than most other western countries , and yet 30 million of your citizens have no coverage at all we have absorbed much from the united states we subscribe to your excellent textbooks and journals , encourage our graduates to go to the united states for continuing education and import the best of your medical technology in one area we may be able to teach you something that would reduce your costs and help leave the planet in better shape we have a health environment awareness link in all teaching hospitals in this city , and it is spreading into smaller health sites throughout australia we are looking critically at many expensive , unnecessary and environmentally disastrous practices that crept into our hospitals in the 1980s we are trying to turn the throwaway decade around by recycling and doing away with socalled single use equipment we used to buy disposable scrubbing brushes from the united states that cost our hospital 30 , 000 a year we now recycle scrubbing brushes and have modified our scrub procedures so that we need fewer of them we have abandoned use of disposable surgical drapes , which cost us 30 , 000 a year , and have gone back to the recyclable linen drapes , which can be sterilized we used to use more than 100 kilometers of plastic tubing and threw it out to incineration we now buy siliconized tubing , recycle and sterilize it we do not use disposable paper towels in a few areas and have almost done away with disposable diapers clever marketing strategies have seduced hospitals and their employees by insisting disposables were the only way to go it was cleaner , safer and cheaper , whereas it is none of these savings in one year alone have amounted to 200 , 000 , and this money has been redirected into patient care when manufacturers realize we mean business they come up with environmentally better and cheaper alternatives harry cohen , md subiaco , australia , july 28 , 1993 the writer is head of the gynecology department at king edward memorial hospital for women
as any boss will tell you , pregnant workers are a problem they keep their pregnancies and maternityleave plans secret as long as possible their productivity drops during the pregnancy they change their minds about going back to work even if they return when promised , they are n't as productive as before even worse , accommodations made to pregnant workers cause a negative reaction among coworkers and supervisors ellen galinsky and colleagues at the families and work institute in new york had heard these alleged truisms lobbed around for years when the institute decided to apply some science to the supervisors' attitudes , it was obvious what assumptions needed testing we just wrote down all of the things executives said to us , ms galinsky said it turns out virtually none of the pregnancy lamentations enumerated earlier resemble reality as supervisors generally experience it the report s release comes as congress , with president clinton s blessing , is resurrecting legislation that would entitle employees in large companies up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave each year for pregnancy , adoption or family illness ms galinsky s work , done with graham staines , on supervisors' attitudes toward parental leave is only one chapter of the full effort , parental leave and productivity , but it contributes a great deal to efforts to move the familyleave debate out of the realm of mythology and ideology and into the realm of rationality the study is based on a large hightech company one that prefers to remain anonymous that was willing to deliver a sample of its vast work force to answer questionnaires the company s employees , who range from line workers to professionals , can take a year of unpaid parental leave for birth or adoption , a policy most businesses would regard as ruinously generous the research systematically tested and refuted the most commonly held wisdom about pregnancy and maternity it found , for example , that nearly threefourths of supervisors learned about an impending leave in the first trimester of the pregnancy nearly half had at least five months' notice of plans for taking time off twothirds of employees stuck to their leave plans the third who changed plans usually asked for a longer leave , but most of them 94 percent returned to work at some point on the productivity of the pregnant worker , fourfifths of the supervisors said they saw no change more than 90 percent reported no effect on the work of colleagues , so if coworkers are upset about maternity policies , they are not telling their supervisors and about threequarters reported no change in the pregnant workers' attendance , a finding that might help put to rest the notion that morning sickness is undermining america s global competitiveness the study does not contend that pregnancy causes no problems or disruptions it takes note of the fact that a pregnancy may necessitate changes in schedule or responsibilities , which can take up time and attention a third of supervisors grumble about hiring replacements who never quite get up to speed and a quarter worry about problems with clients problems were most likely to arise when supervisors had negative feelings about workers taking family leave or were unfamiliar with company policies or when the person taking the leave had complications with the pregnancy , was a relatively new hire or a poor performer the researchers chose the company because , as the study says , a company with a policy allowing such long leaves could provide a rigorous test of what supervisors in other companies might see as a worstcase scenario could the apparent benevolence of company policy skew the results toward the positive \? the 94 percent postpregnancy return rate , for example , is higher than rates found by other studies , perhaps because of worries about layoffs at the company under study or , as ms galinsky points out , because companies with liberal leave policies tend to have higher retention rates but she believes the study s findings can be applied to smaller companies and says they are consistent with other research the institute has done on family leave policies the study s essence for a company of any size is that executives express considerably more pessimism about pregnancy and the workplace than seems to be warranted by the facts why \? for one thing , inconvenience leaves a firmer impression than ease when there are problems , they cloud out any good experiences you might have had , ms galinsky said for another , she contends , despite the flood of women into the work force in recent decades , americans feel a fundamental ambivalence about women who work we have n't come to cultural terms with changes in our lives the keys attitude and planning enterprises the size of the 25employee families and work institute are supposed to have the most problems accommodating maternity leaves so how is it that ellen galinsky survived two maternity leaves by her partner , dana friedman , apparently in fine style \? attitude and planning are everything ms galinsky doubts it is a coincidence that the institute s new study shows that supervisors with the most negative attitudes toward leave also had the most problems with productivity for a manager to have on average five months' notice of a change and not be able to plan for it is far more a reflection of a poor manager than of a leave , ms friedman said ms friedman s leaves were treated as a fact of life people are people , ms galinsky said they will have babies and sick relatives and get sick it s something you have to consider as opposed to a real annoyance she added , we just planned it ms galinsky felt inconvenienced only if she felt inadequate she said there were situations where i did n't know how to respond because i did n't know the long history did this cause her to rethink her commitment to familyfriendly policies \? mostly it caused her to pick up the phone and call dana parental leave and productivity is available from the institute at \( 212 \) 4652044 or 330 seventh avenue , new york , ny 10001 photo ellen galinsky , left , and dana friedman , partners at the families and work institute in manhattan \( dith pran the new york times \)

to the editor may i reply to wendy doniger s review of my book in the shadow of moloch the sacrifice of children and its impact on western religions \( aug 1 \) \? i 've learned to my sorrow that an author of books on indian mythology , which both delighted and instructed me over many years , has another side to her character when she feels threatened in cherished beliefs by a psychoanalyst trespassing into her domain fortunately for my side of the argument , ms doniger s illtempered review of my book raises questions of general import to readers of these pages i am accused of eurocentrism and phallocentrism ms doniger knows that these are inflammatory accusations , not scholarly terms the first is an appeal to the passions of the third world and the second to the extreme wing of the feminist movement as a professor of comparative religion , ms doniger knows that islam , like christianity , had its origin in hebrew monotheism and that abraham s sacrifice is commemorated as a muslim feast the core of my book is a demonstration that judaism and christianity were efforts to tame the aggression of the deity and transform hedonistic gods into a loving god to describe religious events that took place in one part of the world is not eurocentrism i am well aware of the role of the bodhisattva who elects to forgo his own nirvana by staying in the world as to the accusation of phallocentrism , i am accused \( following freud \) of tolerating incest between father and daughter while being horrified by motherson incest and condemning pederasty ms doniger cites no evidence for this serious charge there is none in my book as to freud , he believed only that motherson incest is more horrifying because it is unconsciously associated with the remerger of the son into the mother s body all types of incest are encountered in psychoanalytic work it is nonsense to state that we psychoanalysts tolerate one type and are horrified by others as to pederasty , i have expressed my view and cited freud on homosexual love in an earlier book , the anatomy of loving in that book i also used egyptian , assyrian and indian love poetry so much for my disdain for other cultures ms doniger thought i would surely never recover from this one of his greatest howlers comes when he discusses islam and remarks sura states it is not their flesh and blood that reaches god but the piety of your heart \( 22 38 \) ' he seems to take sura' to be the name of a muslim sage or text , but it is simply the term for a chapter in the koran sura 22 38' means 'chapter 22 , verse 38' this is not a minor technicality but proof that he is citing a book the koran that he has not read this suggests a cultural illiteracy that is disdainful of other worlds no kidding , ms doniger \? have you never encountered a copyediting error in your own books \? the arabic sura has a hebrew equivalent , shura , meaning line just reverse the order to sura \( 22 38 \) states and my cultural illiteracy has been erased finally , the fact that i appeared in woody allen s film crimes and misdemeanors and that he gave me a chance to express ideas that were parts of my two books seems to have shocked my reviewer but is this reason enough not to mention the central idea of my book \? human history and even recent holocaust history have shown that humanity suffers from the preponderance of aggression over love the idea of a loving god is a most daring attempt to undo this deficit however , since we also make our gods in our own images , a deity free from aggression has so far been beyond our capacity to create i am left with the puzzle why my book , scholarly in content and published by a university press , evoked such a reaction ms doniger is troubled by my finding that parents have incestuous and even murderous wishes toward their children she is right , but the dreams of our analysands and pagan and monotheistic myths provide ample evidence the great human miracle is that out of such raw material , largely but not completely unconscious , humanity has also succeeded in creating profound religions , magnificent cathedrals and other houses of worship , and immortal works of art martin s bergmann new york
while many of the prize horses of two continents were primping backstage for belmont week yesterday , a lessillustrious field of six sprinters supplied an opening act that set a stirring tone when a 321 long shot won the roseben handicap in a threehorse photo finish the star was the 4yearold colt codys key , who had won only one race in the last year and a half and none since last july but he took the lead at the start , stayed close through fast fractions and refused to concede anything when challenged in the home stretch at the wire , he poked his head in front of sunnybutcold , who poked his nose in front of the evenmoney favorite slerp , and he opened belmont week with a smash gary contessa , who trains codys key for raymond t sheerin of new york , said the soap opera went deeper than that his colt has had two operations on the same leg and missed six months of racing one time and seven months the next time and he was n't even booked into the roseben until the belmont racing office persuaded him to go for it they convinced me to take a shot , he said now i better nominate him for something else quick he s always been a fast horse , but he s always had his problems when he got caught in the stretch , i thought that was it but he really fought back the winner , with jorge chavez riding , zipped the six furlongs in 1 094 5 , and returned a resounding 6620 for 2 to win not bad as opening acts go alydeed a heavyweight favorite the weekend reaches its dramatic high tomorrow with the 10th running of the genuine risk stakes and the 500 , 000 metropolitan handicap ten star sprinters will run in the metropolitan , and the favorite at 52 is the canadian champion alydeed but he also will carry high weight of 124 pounds , 3 more than bertrando , 5 more than ibero , 6 more than fly so free and 9 more than furiously in a field filled with class and speed mike keough , deputy trainer to roger attfield in the kinghaven farm , indicated that the race might mark a career change for alydeed , the 4yearold son of shadeed who has won nine of his 14 starts and has run in the money 12 times after this race , he said , i think we 'll take a look at the turf he s bred for it mackenzie miller , who will saddle sea hero for saturday s belmont stakes , five weeks after the colt won the kentucky derby , reported that he had decided not to doubleteam the field by also entering england expects instead , he will run england expects in the riva ridge stakes the same day garden state goes dark they rang down the curtain on the thoroughbred season last night at garden state park in cherry hill , nj , possibly for good the action shifts today to monmouth park for the next 73 days of racing at oceanport on the shore garden s state s future remains in some doubt because the track has been put up for sale under growing competition from other tracks in the area and from the gambling colossus down the road in atlantic city the plant will stay open for harness racing , which runs from sept 8 to dec 4 , and for simulcasting every day from as many as 11 other tracks exporting their races on tv presidential ball wins east rutherford , nj , may 29 \( special to the new york times \) a late change in drivers made no difference to presidential ball , who surprised no one by winning the 500 , 000 new jersey classic tonight at the meadowlands driven by ron waples , presidential ball took command from the outset and was never seriously theatened by the nine other 3yearold pacers he covered the mile in 1 514 5 and paid 240 for 2 to win after going off as the overhwelming favorite at 15 waples replaced jack moiseyev , the leading harness racing driver in the united states , who was involved in a spill at freehold raceway in the afternoon presidential ball earned his third victory in four starts this season no way was second , two and a half lengths behind , followed by pacific devil in the first rich race of the harness season at the meadowlands race track the 33yearold moiseyev was injured in the 11th race at freehold when his horse , fannie s champ , made a break and fell while in second place along the rail moiseyev was struck by two other horses and was taken to central state medical center in freehold , suffering from a concussion , multiple bruises and muscle sprains it was not immediately clear whether he may have suffered fractures as well
is it a butterfly or a leaf \? the butterfly counters said they would meet at the ihop restaurant in east norwich but the butterfly counters did not say what they looked like entering a roomful of pancake eaters , none of whom carried a net or wore a pith helmet , a reporter had but one option excuse me , she said to table after table of diners are you counting butterflies today \? the actual butterfly census takers sat bemused what did you expect us to look like \? asked skip blanchard of huntington station certainly not like mr blanchard , a bear of a man who with his white hair , stocky build and jeans held up by suspenders looked just like a paul bunyan butterfly lovers come in all sizes , as witnessed by mr blanchard and al and lois lindberg of oyster bay they were but one group who ventured forth to count the butterflies around muttontown the muttontown count is conducted each year in conjunction with a national count it s similar to the christmas bird count , mr blanchard said but we 're not crazy we go out in the nice weather which of course is when the butterflies are out counting them is a challenge , said mr blanchard , a professor of biology at the c w post campus of long island university , because they are mobile you could count the same flying butterfly over and over for the common species , we estimate , said mr lindberg , a naturalist for nassau county does that mean that the 1 , 058 cabbage white butterflies counted last year were not exact \? well , maybe it was 1 , 057 , mr blanchard said butterfly census takers can also be too conservative three cabbage whites were spotted outside the restaurant mr blanchard kept his notebook closed he was wanted to go to a field in jericho i hope this year to see a tawny emperor , he said to spot that emperor he took out his binoculars , mandatory equipment for counting how else to identify a moving insect 200 feet away \? mr blanchard also carried a net for verification only , he said we do n't catch butterflies we count them heading out into the field , the official count started now we lie , and the others swear to it , mrs lindberg said only kidding , she added mrs lindberg would never lie she works for the nassau county museums as a curator of natural science for the butterfly census she wore a tshirt adorned with insects spotting insects from afar takes a trained eye is that a butterfly \? the reporter asked no , that s a blowing leaf , mr lindberg replied the group happened upon a pair of mating monarchs monarchs were soon as common as sea gulls at the beach so were butterflies of every hue twelve species so far , mr blanchard announced a halfhour into the count heading into tall weeds , he said you know this is recreation for us i was out the other day with my net and i thought what i must look like then i happened up a group of men flying radiocontrol airplanes round and round i said to myself , 'at least i'm doing something constructive' but you should n't judge people by their hobbies or the nets they carry on the thin side to sallyjane heit , the hamptons represent gluttony , greed and excess that is why she recently fasted there is n't that the point \? said ms heit , an actress who lives in east hampton in the face of all the hamptons have to offer , i spent three days just drinking juice the juice was supplied by a new company called get juiced it also supplied the fast fasting in the hamptons could become a trend , said pamela serure of amagansett , who , along with nancy sorkow , owns get juiced there is so much fluff out here , ms serure said you go to radu then you have a muffin if one really wants to help the body , she said , try fasting her company offers a threeday package it combines juicing , beach walks , meditation and yoga , she said a little pasta would be nice , too thirty seconds into the fast i was starving to death , ms heit said but having put on a few pounds and about to begin production in ron howard s new movie the paper , ms heit felt a need to do something for myself she spent most of her fast like elizabeth barrett browning , she said i retired to the couch there is , after all , the cleansing effects of consuming nothing but fruit and vegetable juices your whole insides say , 'i 'll see you later , ' ms serure said another challenge for those fasting in the hamptons , where public restrooms are at a premium so it seems is manufacturing space the juice mixtures of ms serure and her partner are created and bottled in the kitchen of nick toni s between 3 and 8 am still , business has been good we hired a squeezer , ms serure said everybody is into health in the hamptons , ms serure said it s just a matter of degree a man came up to me the other day , she recalled , and said , 'i want your juices to mix with my alcohol' did she sell him some \? well they are organic , she said i figured at least he s doing something for his body carp crop all right as fish go , it s ugly and it should n't be eaten in great quantities , given the condition of long island ponds but the carp has one redeeming quality , said gregory e kozlowski , a senior aquatic biologist for the state environmental conservation department carp grow big , he said and big fish are fun to catch thus the reason for the department s first carp derby the person catching the heaviest carp in nassau county will receive a prize catching it in suffolk will get you nothing but a large carp we 're highlighting nassau county , mr kozlowski said , because it s been kind of ignored over the years to make sure that nassau residents no longer feel ignored , at least in the carp department , a big carp award is being given each month through september , to the adult and the angler under 16 who catch the heaviest carp there are even second and third prizes details are available from mr kozlowski at 4440283 the biggest carp caught in the contest so far weighed 12 pounds but i hear there are some 35 pounders or bigger out there , mr kozlowski said the carp is probably the most common fish in the fresh waters of long island that is because so few people fish for it it s so misunderstood , mr kozlowski said in europe it s a delicacy it s food for royalty on long island there may be a few carp connoisseurs , but mr kozlowski is not one of them i never tasted carp , he said but a little carp scampi or carp gefilte fish could tempt him photos skip blanchard , foreground , with lois and al lindberg as they took part in butterfly count in jericho \( photographs by michael shavel for the new york times \)
paris , dec 3 steep drops in oil prices , like those that followed opec s failure to agree on production cuts last week , are usually greeted with relief from consumers but the organization of petroleum exporting countries , in an apparent retreat from a sevenyear policy of defending oil prices , has issued a tacit warning that lower oil prices are a doubleedged sword that can wound all the world s producers , and eventually its consumers opec and oil industry officials said the organization was calling for an international effort to shore up oil prices , which fell to a threeyear low of 1531 a barrel in the united states on monday , the first trading day after the opec meeting falling oil prices , they say , are a problem for all countries , not just the 12 members of the oil group help from industrial nations the new strategy is to push industrial countries to cooperate in maintaining production levels and prices opec ministers argue that a steep fall in oil prices will depress the vast and powerful oil industries of the united states and britain , as well as the many service industries dependent on them the organization also argues , and oil experts agree , that if earnings of large oil companies fall drastically , investment in exploration for oil will slow , creating the potential for an eventual shortage many years from now among the lessdeveloped nations that are oil producers , many count on oil revenues to pay for ambitious economic and social plans a shortfall in financing for such programs could have a profound impact on mexico , oman , yemen , malaysia , brunei , colombia and especially russia impact on russia oil exports represent the bulk of export revenues for the russians , said matthew sagers , an oil affairs expert at planecon , a washington consulting firm a steep drop in prices , he said , would affect the pace of economic reforms , their ability to borrow money against oil sales and the stability of the currency , even if it eases the burden on the russian consumer declining oil revenues have certainly hurt opec members with inflation taken into account , oil prices today are nearly at 1986 levels but the member nations , particularly saudi arabia , the group s largest producer , have undertaken costly civil projects they can now barely afford saudi arabia has even resorted to borrowing to finance its projects the squeeze has led to political upheavals in many opec nations algeria s economic situation , for example , has deteriorated sharply as oil revenues have dropped the country faced a major uprising by unemployed youth in 1988 and is now locked in a virtual civil war intensified by the inability of the government to improve economic conditions nigeria , too , has been in political and economic turmoil for years , undergoing one military coup after another as its economy fails to keep up with the demands of a growing population and venezuela s development program , sustained for decades with oil revenue , has collapsed the first indication of the new strategy became evident at the opec meeting of oil ministers in vienna last week a oneday meeting during the oneday gathering , the organization s shortest in years , the 12 members served notice that they would not reduce their collective output below the present level of 245 million barrels a day none of the individual nations , continuing to crave oil revenues , appeared willing to sacrifice instead , the organization pointedly called in its official communique for international cooperation to support prices opec officials confirmed that the notion of universal production restraint was spreading within the organization i think it is time for everyone to face their responsibility , a senior official said in a telephone interview today , alirio parra , venezuela s energy minister , said opec was determined to sweat it out most of us are not willing to sacrifice output any longer , he said there will be no opec production cuts before march , when we are scheduled to meet and evaluate the situation until then , we just have to wait and see a number of oil industry analysts warned , however , that unless opec returned immediately to its role of balancing supply and demand by reducing its collective output , it would risk seeing oil prices head toward 10 a barrel or lower 'they will lose' this is a deadly game they will lose , gary n ross , the chief executive of petroleum industry research associates of new york , said in an interview mehdi verzi , an oil analyst at kleinwort benson securities in london , agreed in a telephone interview that oil prices would probably head lower oil prices have entered a new trading range that can only get lower in the absence of an opec production cut , mr verzi said the recent failure to raise prices is only the latest example of the oil organization s dwindling power even though the opec share of oil sales has increased to nearly 25 million barrels of the world s estimated daily oil consumption of 68 million barrels prices have remained low in 1986 , opec tried a similar strategy of maintaining production , but it eventually failed and prices fell to 10 a barrel , provoking a change of strategy in an emergency meeting analysts say the organization s latest quest to preserve its share of the oil market is misguided opec , they say , would be better off seeking higher oil prices and cutting as much production as necessary , cartels work if they sell oil , said john h lichtblau , the president of the petroleum industry research foundation in new york they do n't work when they just try to preserve market shares
laguna niguel , calif , dec 10 like students sent home early for a holiday vacation , the owners and executives of the national hockey league streamed out of their conference room today , ending the board of governors meeting one day ahead of schedule bill wirtz , the president of the chicago blackhawks and former chairman of the board , told reporters that a committee had been formed to investigate peter pocklington s plan to move his edmonton oilers to minnesota it s a committee created under bylaw 46 for transfers , wirtz said before a team can be moved , the league must consider selling the franchise to local people , prospective buyers , all that stuff , wirtz added a few minutes later , wirtz s news came as a surprise to commissioner gary bettman bylaw 46 \? you mean bylaw 36 , bettman said no , we did not form a committee under bylaw 36 at some point , we may have to , but we have n't yet i apologize for any confusion old vs new welcome to the confusing world of the nhl as it pushes forward , out of the 19th century and toward the 21st wirtz , whose clout has declined tremendously in the new era , is from the old chicago school of politics , a master at cutting deals and forming alliances in smoky back rooms bettman , more than two decades younger , is more of a modern corporate man , a chief executive officer with a business plan in a smokefree board room , unencumbered by old allegiances but bettman did n't achieve everything he wanted at this meeting bettman pushed hard for a draft lottery to eliminate any suspicion that teams might lose games in order to finish last and get the top pick the idea did n't even come to a vote i think the bulk of the general managers are probably against it , said neil smith , the president and general manager of the rangers smith said that under a lottery of teams that fail to make the playoffs , a team that underachieved , like his 199293 rangers , might get lucky and get the best player it would n't be fair , smith said the other major debate was over a shootout system to determine winners of tie games after overtime no vote was taken and none was expected marcel aubut , the quebec owner who often leads progressive movements , will be part of the committee that will study the issue it s an exciting concept , aubut said the support is getting stronger it took me years to get overtime , years to get video replay i have to be patient those executives opposed to the concept argue that players with only limited skills , such as shooting , will determine the outcome of a game in much the same way that fieldgoal kickers win football games bob clarke , general manager of the florida panthers , said it would be like letting a quarterback decide a tie football game by throwing the ball through a tire implementing a shootout would mean teams would have to carry shooting specialists on their rosters , much the way they now carry two or three fighters should the shootout issue come to a vote , the ballots will be cast not by canadianbred executives but by owners , the majority of whom are businessmen from the united states bettman , saying it s an emotional issue , will instruct his committee to consider the business factors of the shootout with dispassionate analysis jim lites , the executive vice president of the dallas stars , said of the shootout debate it s serious it s not thrown out as some kind of dumb idea it s being approached the right way it s a very controversial issue put on a happy face bettman tried to put a positive spin on even the most negative news when asked about the ratings on espn this second season , he said they were about the same before admitting they had dropped from an average of 1 rating point last season at this time to an average of 7 \( one rating point equals 931 , 000 television households \) he danced around the question of moving the oilers , although such a move appears more likely than ever bettman hinted that the hartford whalers might be the next in line to move and that even more expansion could follow as soon as the 26 existing teams get their ducks in a row maybe the timetable will be moved up , bettman said of expansion among the cities that might get a transferred team or an expansion franchise are houston , atlanta , cleveland and portland , ore although the hockey business is chugging along , there are troubling signs in several markets edmonton s attendance has dropped to the 10 , 000 level for some games , and crowds in the 8 , 000 range are not uncommon in hartford , long island and even washington the attendances in a lot of places are very alarming , said smith
dartmouth , mass , april 13 clusters of students wept and hugged each other today as they tried to come to terms with the mystifying violence of monday morning , when three teenagers armed with a baseball bat , a billy club and a buck knife burst into a high school social studies classroom and fatally stabbed a 16yearold freshman students were bewildered that the violence they associated with urban schools could have occurred at suburban dartmouth high , which had always reflected stability and security the kids keep saying , 'this happens in city schools , not here , ' said the school principal , donald king , who brought in a team of counselors to help restore calm the dead student , jason robinson , was apparently a bystander in a feud between two groups of teenagers some of whom attended dartmouth high school who had been trading insults and , the police said , calling each other s mothers names while jason s american government teacher , james murphy , wrestled the teenager with the baseball bat to the floor , another of the youths pulled out the knife and stabbed jason in the stomach , the dartmouth police said jason staggered into the hallway and collapsed in the arms of a classmate moments later , mr king , who had raced from his office up two flights of stairs into the classroom , caught one of three teenagers and grabbed the knife out of his pocket the third teenager , who had fled down the hallway , was apprehended by another teacher by the time the police got here , we had the weapons and all three kids , mr king said the three teenagers , who have all been charged with firstdegree murder and other related charges , were being held without bail at the department of youth services they were identified as karter reed and gator collet , both 16 , and nigel thomas , 15 two of the three attended the high school , with one of them a recent transfer student none of them had criminal records or were well known here , either as troublemakers or as star students a hearing later will determine whether they will be tried as adults or juveniles effort to be normal the spotless corridors of dartmouth high school are lined with plaques that honor it as a national model of excellence a glass case just inside the entrance filled with some of the scores of trophies won by the school s marching band , which is known throughout new england today , in a valiant effort at normality , the band played on , practicing for a trip next week to disney world most of the school s 1 , 100 students and all of the 120 faculty members were also in attendance today when school ended at 2 05 , a senior named julie cabral , in blue jeans and a purple sweatshirt , was rushing off for a fitting for her prom dress things like this are n't supposed to happen in dartmouth , she said , as she headed for her car the most violence she said , was fistfights once in a while her sister , she said , is a freshman , a classmate of jason robinson before the stabbing monday morning , she said , jason had been goodnaturedly teasing her sister irritated , her sister had apparently told jason , i hate you she s all freaked out about it , miss cabral said she was like , 'how was i supposed to know he was going to die next period \? ' no graffiti , no guards no graffiti mar the brick walls at dartmouth there are no security guards and no metal detectors there has never been a need for them , said mr king , who graduated from the high school in 1960 , taught science and coached football here for 13 years , and has been principal for seven years mr king calmly answered questions from reporters today and then invited the residents of this town six miles southwest of new bedford to a meeting to discuss the killing he said he expected that some people would blame him and that it was his job to listen to what anyone has to say i would like to have a nice , safe school with open doors , but if society wo n't is n't going to let us mr king said , he would do what he had to protect his students the principal had no more answers than his students did there are no gangs at dartmouth , he said , where most of the students are children of fishermen or of professors at the nearby university of massachusetts campus a fight escalates the events that led to the stabbing apparently began sunday night when a fistfight broke out between two groups of teenagers , including at least one of those accused in jason s killing the fight spilled over into the school early monday morning the principal broke up the fight shortly afterward , two students alerted mr king that the three teenagers had entered the school we went and chased them , said mr king , 50 , a former member of the dartmouth high school football team when we got there it was too late the intruders were apparently looking to settle a score with a student who had been involved in sunday night s fracas , the police said that student was a friend of jason robinson when the teenagers arrived at the classroom , they did not find the student they were after jason robinson stood up and asked them why there were looking for his friend , and then one went after him with a bat and the other stabbed him , the police said jason died at st luke s hospital less than an hour later photo jessica daigle , left , and ellen carter , students at dartmouth high school in massachusetts , handing out copies of a photo of jason robinson , a freshman who was stabbed to death in a feud among teenagers \( frieda squires for the new york times \) map shows location of dartmouth , mass
the oldest preserved softbodied creatures ever found , singlecelled microorganisms that lived at the dawn of the age of dinosaurs , have been identified in fragments of amber from a sandstone deposit in germany the creatures protozoa , bacteria , algae , pollen and spores are strikingly similar to presentday species , according to a report being published today by the journal science evolution seems scarcely to have changed these microorganisms in more than 220 million years the discovery was made by dr george o poinar jr of the university of california at berkeley and benjamin m waggoner , a graduate student of dr poinar s while fossilized remains and tracks of softbodied organisms have been found in rocks almost as old as the origin of life on earth , mineralized fossils contain little or none of their original tissue by contrast , the microorganisms entombed in the german amber contain intact tissue , including , dr poinar hopes , the dna of their genetic codes old amber commonly contains arthropods , insects and even frogs and larger animals trapped by the sticky resin of certain trees the resin eventually hardens into amber , a yellow or brownish yellow translucent natural polymer similar to plastic amber excludes air and moisture from trapped organisms and has other preservative properties prolonged germination in the case of the german amber , the berkeley researchers found no multicelled animals or plants in the amber but an entire colony of singlecelled organisms they believe that the organisms may have constituted a community living in pockets of stagnant rain water that collected in bark crevices or at the bases of branches of a resinous tree the colony may have been trapped by a sudden flood of resin from the tree one pollen grain found in the amber had been sprouting a bud when the resin overwhelmed it , preserving the instant of its germination for a quarter billion years , dr poinar said he and his colleagues have not been able to identify the type of tree that produced the amber , but they believe it may have been the same species of extinct cycad found elsewhere in the sandstone deposit in the form of mineralized fossils the discovery of microorganisms in amber dating from the triassic period 230 million years ago opens up a whole new world for us , a new field of micropaleontology , dr poinar said in an interview dna extraction efforts dr poinar , an entomologist , has devoted much of his career to the study of ancient organisms trapped in amber in collaboration with other scientists , he has collected and examined bees , mushrooms , rodent hairs , gnats , lizards and a frog embedded in amber mined in the dominican republic last september he and his colleagues , as well as another team of scientists at the american museum of natural history in new york , independently recovered dna from insects embedded in amber for 40 million years dr poinar and his collaborators have not yet tried to extract dna from the singlecelled organisms in the german amber , but he hopes dna from their nuclei can be recovered and analyzed he also hopes to visit and examine the german site , near schliersee , bavaria , where the amber was collected by a local resident , ulfchristan bauer it s hard to say why these organisms underwent so few evolutionary changes over the last 230 million years , unless their genes just hit on a winning formula and found no reason to change , he said perhaps there is some factor in nature that accelerates evolutionary change only in response to environmental pressures , which these organisms did n't experience
jerusalem , jan 24 although worried about inviting charges of racism , a committee of israeli cabinet ministers has decided against extending automatic immigration rights to perhaps tens of thousands of ethiopians who descend from jews but are themselves christians the committee instead proposes allowing only some of these ethiopians , known as falash mura , to join family members who are already in israel , on what officials describe as an individual and humanitarian basis that could still be thousands of people , the officials say but the ministers chose not to take a giant extra step demanded by ethiopian advocacy groups to declare all falash mura to be forced converts and therefore eligible to settle in israel under the law of return , which gives every jew the right of immigration the panel s recommendations are expected to receive the full government s approval but that is unlikely to end the dispute , which is merely the latest trouble related to the difficult integration of more than 14 , 000 ethiopian jews who were brought to israel in an airlift in may 1991 complaints about treatment thousands of them remain stuck in trailer parks , lacking jobs and proper education rabbinical challenges to the authority of their traditional spiritual leaders have produced complaints from ethiopians that the authorities treat them as less jewish than others to complicate matters , many of the ethiopian jews claim the falash mura nonjews as brethren , and insist that those people , too , be delivered from poverty back home their plight has taken some of the luster from the excitement generally associated with the arrivals from ethiopia , many of whom have been absorbed successfully into israeli life , especially those who came on an earlier airlift in 1984 because they had been cut off from both the ashkenazic and sephardic jewish mainstreams for many centuries , they are swathed in exoticism for many jews in reality , while their number in israel of about 45 , 000 is important , it is too small to have a great demographic impact on a country of 5 million by comparison , there are well over 600 , 000 israelis with origins in russia and other former soviet republics , and a similar number with roots in morocco their number uncertain still , the ethiopians and their problems often receive close attention , and it has been no different with the falash mura , whose name is an amharic phrase meaning falashas , or ethiopian jews , who are now christians clearly concerned that racism charges might arise , government officials went out of their way in recent days to explain their decision in special press briefings nobody is exactly sure how many falash mura there are in ethiopia some estimates run to 100 , 000 or more , but a widely accepted figure is between 25 , 000 and 30 , 000 whatever the real numbers , they are descendants of jews who at some point for the most part , the late 19th century converted to christianity either through coercion or as a matter of convenience to bring them all here under the law of return would probably set off a rabbinical outcry that they are not jewish , a cabinet minister said but to accept none at all would be to leave many families in hardship so a midway solution was reached , to concentrate on individual cases in which close relatives could be reunited with ethiopians who clearly are jewish and have already been brought here absorption minister yair tsaban said that a particularly urgent effort on this score would be made in the near future attention would first be given to about 4 , 000 falash mura who drifted to the ethiopian capital of addis ababa two years ago thinking they would be part of the 1991 airlift although officials insisted that race was never a consideration , some ethiopian leaders here charge bias they point out that many recent arrivals from the former soviet union some say tens of thousands have been accepted with virtually no questions asked even though they are not jewish at all or have at best the most tenuous connection to judaism double standard charged this is a double standard , one for the soviet jewry and one for the ethiopian jewry , said michael corinaldi , an israeli lawyer who has pleaded the falash mura s case yehuda etzion , an ethiopian leader , was quoted in the israeli press as saying that there is going to be plenty of trouble , starting with an appeal to the high court of justice but government officials say they are not competent to decide whether the falash mura qualify as jews under the law of return partly , it is because questions arise about how compulsory their families' conversions to christianity had been it is also because those conversions took place many decades ago , even centuries in some cases to qualify automatically as a jew under the law of return , the officials say , a person must have a closer connection to judaism than that besides , they add , absorbing ethiopians into israeli society has been difficult enough without complicating the problem further with new disputes over who is a jew

washington , nov 9 the meeting between foreign minister shimon peres of israel and king hussein of jordan last week provided a glimpse into a fascinating new phase of middle east politics in which different arab parties are tacitly forging alliances with israel against one another now that the walls of enmity around israel are crumbling , israel is being drawn more than ever into the dosido of arab rivalries and economic competition in the past , none of israel s arab neighbors would have dared a relationship with israel now , none can afford to be without such a relationship for long as the most powerful state in the region , israel has the ability to tip the balance of power among the arab nations one way or another as it is integrated into the region s labyrinthine politics this , in turn , is creating all sorts of new complications for american diplomacy in the middle east , where washington finds itself in the unusual position of playing traffic cop with one hand it is waving ahead the israelipalestinian and israelijordanian alliances , and with the other hand it is motioning them to slow down a bit , so that syria does not feel so isolated that it tries to sabotage them one up on arafat the reason that king hussein was eager to meet with mr peres , american officials say , is essentially that he was trying to outflank yasir arafat , the palestine liberation organization chairman who had outflanked the jordanian monarch by cutting his own secret deal with the israelis in september without telling amman king hussein s primary concern was reaching an understanding with the israelis that would insure jordan s continuing economic supremacy , not to mention political influence , in the west bank even after mr arafat sets up his selfrule in gaza and jericho look , everyone wants his share of the pie , a jordanian official said from amman unless you move fast , you are going to be forgotten we are just trying to make sure we get our share to that end the jordanian king and the israeli foreign minister discussed the outlines of a deal that would go well beyond the draft treaty agenda israel and jordan signed two months ago , according to american and middle east diplomats they did not reach a final agreement , but what they sketched out in principle was that in return for jordan s agreement to a full peace treaty with israel , israel would address several concerns of king hussein about the interim period of palestinian selfrule control of jordan bridges to begin with , the king wanted to be assured that israel would not turn over control of the bridges over the jordan river just outside jericho to the palestinians , because that would give mr arafat the ability to control the migration of palestinians and islamic militants from gaza and jericho into jordan the king also wanted assurances that the jordanian dinar , along with the israeli shekel , would remain the official legal tender of the west bank and gaza strip , and not some new palestinian currency in addition , he wanted to be assured that only jordanian banks would be licensed to operate in the west bank and gaza , so that the millions of dollars that are soon to be channeled into these areas for palestinian development would come through the jordanian banking system since 1986 there has been only one arab bank operating in the west bank , the cairoamman bank the jordanians not only wanted to make sure they would not have to compete with a palestinian bank , but also were trying to head off a move by the egyptians to open their own banks in these areas king hussein also wanted assurances that israel would help guarantee that jordan received a share of the 2 billion pledged so far by international donors for development projects in the west bank and gaza in particular , the jordanians want a cut of any regional projects like water development schemes , electricity grids , road networks and dead sea phosphate mines opening of captive market finally , the jordanians wanted to get a slice of what is expected to be an expanding trade market with the west bank and gaza the west bank exports about 70 million in citrus and olive oil through jordan to the rest of the arab world israel has banned all jordanian imports into the west bank , keeping it a captive market for israel jordan and israel are now discussing allowing a specific level of jordanian imports israel has been offering 15 million and jordan is holding out for around 300 million a year on top of all this , king hussein has been speaking publicly these days about his hashemite dynasty s traditional role as keeper of the muslim holy places in jerusalem a shot across mr arafat s bow should he get any ideas about trying to extend his authority in that direction one reason the jordanians and israelis have not formalized these deals yet is because the jordanians are afraid of upsetting syria , american officials said syria s own bargaining leverage visavis israel would be further eroded if damascus cannot claim to speak for either jordan or the palestinians king hussein also was reluctant to make this deal concrete because he has doubts about the ability of israel and the plo to carry out their accord , and does not want to get out ahead of them the americans , who were notified in advance of the pereshussein meeting but were surprised by its progress , are also a little edgy president clinton has been telling president hafez elassad of syria for weeks now that the united states is committed to fostering a syrianisraeli deal over the golan heights but he has cautioned that mr assad he has to be patient because israel s prime minister , yitzhak rabin , cannot move too quickly on the peace front with a second arab state before the israeli public digests the deal with mr arafat and the plo effect on syria american officials are feeling torn in light of the pereshussein talks on the one hand , they know they have some explaining to do with mr assad before he feels misled and isolated and tries to scuttle both the israelijordanian and israeliplo deals but on the other hand , they also believe that the jordanianisraeli deal might stir the syrian leader to be a more forthcoming toward israel than he has been up to now then again , say american officials , if mr assad were to say tomorrow that he is ready to trade full peace for an israeli withdrawal from the golan , they might have a problem , because mr rabin does not seem ready for that now then again , they add , if the syrian leader made such peace overture , it might quickly change mr rabin s calculations either way , these mixed emotions underscore how complicated the peace negotiations become when all the parties suddenly get involved and israel s relations with one arab country tip the scales against another
vancouver , british columbia , june 20 purple hair ! pierced lips ! tattoos ! souvenir tshirts that cost 28 ! they were all on display in the audience for the lollapalooza festival , the third annual version of the alternativerock showcase and package tour , which got under way on friday afternoon at thunderbird stadium here primus , alice in chains , dinosaur jr , fishbone and arrested development are the major names in a lineup that also includes seven other bands but the audience is also an attraction , as fans in their teens and 20 s look at themselves and test their selfimage as a community lollapalooza is becoming a habit spring break for the alienated in chicago , a july 3 lollapalooza show sold out before performers had been named for antimainstream rockers , the festival combines stadium dates with some underground credibility audiences outside big cities can see headliners they 've heard of and opening acts they may have heard about , without the age restrictions and late hours of rock clubs the festival started out as a generous fluke for the farewell tour by jane s addiction in 1991 , the band s leader , perry farrell , devised an allday concert with bands from rock s noisier fringes , along with a circus tent presenting local art and socialaction groups \( one model was the eclectic reading festival in england \) as other concert tours flopped , lollapalooza turned a profit alternativerock , the more loosely defined the better , was clearly on the upswing for its 1992 sequel , lollapalooza expanded , with a bazaar of ethnic food and clothing and a second stage offering lesserknown bands and a freak show this year , lollapalooza stays on its 1992 scale nine hours of music from eight bands on the main stage and four more bands on the second stage ted gardner , a partner in lollapalooza with mr farrell and the william morris agency , said he expected to draw up to 850 , 000 spectators during the summer tour , at outdoor shows with capacities from 20 , 000 to 40 , 000 people \( the closest approach to new york city is three shows at waterloo village in stanhope , nj , on july 12 , 13 and 16 \) by now , the novelty is wearing off most performers conformed to a collegiaterock antistar pose , but they did the same things as mainstream rock bands on the summer outdoor circuit they played familiar material from their albums , with few new songs or surprises the festival s political elements have atrophied , though there were short presentations , in a separate tent , by groups like the british columbia humane society and youth against gangs and violence as at last year s shows , an electronic signboard above the stage carried slogans and statistics some of its material , like why wo n't bush release peltier \? , about leonard peltier , the american indian rights advocate who some people believe was wrongly imprisoned for murder , have n't been updated but there s still the music , and the third lollapalooza is consistently strong the festival s big quirk is the choice of primus , a san francisco band , to close the show maybe the more popular alice in chains seemed too grim for a finale , while primus is nothing if not snappy primus takes the standard guitarbassdrums trio and turns it into an intricate , comic clatter often , it sounds as if all three musicians are playing bedsprings and junked auto parts primus compresses a decade s worth of progressiverock experiments with dissonance and odd meter into a brittle , shifty quasifunk , virtuosically crisp and clever the focal point is les claypool on bass , playing staccato patterns or snorelike slides , usually in syncopation against tim alexander s meticulous drumming and larry lalonde s guitar mr claypool also sings , in a nasal gnat s cackle , about cracked americana , underachievement and death on recordings , primus is cheerfully annoying in concert , however , the trio s percussive mesh sounded like edgy fun alice in chains , from seattle , played its bleakly majestic songs about drug addiction and death the tempos are slow , letting power chords loom like stone monoliths behind layne staley s dry voice , which can be narrowly penetrating or a tormented howl , the harmonies tend to be chromatic and claustrophobic in verses , sometimes opening to a majorkey chorus for a touch of shortlived hope the music is almost ascetic , and the band performed as if none of its members had ever learned to smile dinosaur jr s set was marred by a loud , bassheavy sound mix under better circumstances , j mascis s songs are tuneful and plainspoken , steeped in neil young and in the replacements but with his own take on uncertainty and a sense of loss his voice is a groaning drawl , while his guitar solos wail and sting both were unintentionally steamrollered by the rhythm section the number of people moshing in front of the stage tripled the moment fishbone started fishbone , from los angeles , was its usual manic self band members strutted , danced and leaped while the music ricocheted from heavymetal to gospel to ska to funk , couching social messages in wily metaphors in the stadium , fishbone s speedy , improvisational arrangements sometimes seemed to be on the verge of breaking up , but they never did onstage and off , the band is used to quick reflexes arrested development , from atlanta , challenged the festival s youthful demographics by performing with a 61yearold group member , who gazed approvingly , danced or sat in a prayerful posture arrested development presents its members as rap s country cousins onstage , a wall held pots and pans but there s real sophistication in the way speech , the group s leader , mixes singing and chanting and turns his raps into parables although the group used some recorded material , a bassist and a drummer onstage shifted songs toward live funk front 242 , a belgian band , makes densely layered albums that add ominous sentiments to the uptempo blips of european dance music onstage , the group simplified a little , keeping the speededup polka beat and growling the chants of the songs' choruses let s keep it working , man ! and it s a wild dream ! but the music seemed uncomfortable in the open air , outside a dance club babes in toyland , from minneapolis , started the main stage show with punkrock that was both measured and primal wearing thriftstore dresses , the threewoman band is proudly unladylike its songs often shift from a sung verse to a screamed chorus , hurling imprecations and gathering power from riffs that change midsong for a new jolt rage against the machine , part of the tour , did not perform because of the death of a band member s father on the second stage \( where bands will change throughout the tour

the beginning of the journey the marriage of diana and lionel trilling by diana trilling illustrated 442 pp new york harcourt brace company 2495 curious about the home of the eminent new york intellectual couple , an admirer of diana and lionel trilling once asked about their apartment on claremont avenue , near columbia university , do they have a view of the river \? oh yes , came the reply , the trillings have an opinion about everything certainly by the 1950 s , when they moved to that address and when the beginning of the journey leaves off , diana trilling was known for the assurance of her views not just on fiction but on politics as well a decade of acclaimed literary reviewing for the nation was behind her , and as she remarks in her extraordinary memoir , what first strikes me about those reviews is how outspoken they were in their statement of my own tastes and judgments in person and in prose that appeared in magazines that ranged from partisan review to mccall s , she conveyed moral certainty and , it was assumed , severity a housekeeping goddess of reason , robert lowell called her in the late 60 s lionel trilling had opinions too , of course , and by midcentury his views on the moral and imaginative limitations of liberal politics and culture were acquiring an authority that none of his colleagues on the quarterly journals or in the university could claim with the publication in 1950 of the liberal imagination , his bestknown work , he was on his way to becoming a cultural figure himself this liberal critic of liberalism was revered for his reasonableness , the elegance of his dialectical style , the refinement of his ideas it s complicated it s much more complicated it s very complicated those careful phrases , his colleague and friend jacques barzun remembered , were trilling s trademark during the polarized ideological debates that he followed from the 1930 s onward no one matched trilling s grace in spanning the world of the academy , the realm of intellectual debate beyond it and a sea of more general readers , whom he addressed as an editor of two book clubs it was only a matter of time before norman podhoretz accused him of aspiring to venerability in the beginning of the journey , mrs trilling cracks these sculptured reputations , her husband s and her own in what she admits is partly a preemptive strike against the biographers she expects will come snooping , she undertakes to reveal the hidden torments herself yet her approach is far from manipulative or scoresettling she is , instead , inspired by unillusioned devotion to her husband and to their marriage of partners unflustered by our cheaply confessional culture , mrs trilling has miraculously discovered a morally dignified yet also ruthlessly honest style of selfexposure she has opened a window onto the life of one of the most important recent practitioners of a now vanishing vocation , cultural criticism her memoir , not at all what one would expect from a housekeeping goddess of reason , hangs reason out to dry it stirs up the dust of passion and confusion , and it uncovers neurosis and bitterness in lives that were presumed to be models of contented gentility , monuments to confident intelligence mrs trilling s rare accomplishment has been not to compromise their youthful lives \( they are both 45 years old at the book s close , in 1950 \) but , in her husband s spirit , to complicate and enlarge them her eyesight failing , mrs trilling had to dictate the book she remarked several years ago that she was afraid this method might impede the desired free flow of feelings and ideas her own rigidly logical tendencies were inhibition enough without the added cold presence of another person to stiffen her there are some traces of awkward impersonality the grandly generalizing spirit of henry adams , the model for the autobiographical memoir that lionel trilling himself was about to begin at his death in 1975 , occasionally descends a little heavily on her book \( that thirdperson subtitle ! \) at other times mrs trilling s attempt at a broad view is a little cursory as a recollection of the world we lived in , the beginning of the journey lacks the dramatic vividness of some previous portraits of the new york intellectuals one might have expected fuller character sketches and thicker description of ideological context from the often combatively engaged antistalinist that diana trilling became after a brief communist phase in 1932 and 1933 her specialty instead is quick dismissals of the predictable company philip rahv , mary mccarthy , elliot cohen , sidney hook and others all stumble in these pages but she is acutely attentive to manners as her husband defined them , a culture s buzz and hum of implication in intimate detail she resurrects the now unfamiliar expectations with which even promising young women were reared in her generation she was one of the many who muddled their way among inchoate hopes and among men , never believing that they were the custodians of their own fates

miami , jan 10 the san diego chargers did n't want to hear any of a multitude of excuses they could embrace not about a glaring lack of playoff experience costing them not about the incessant rain at joe robbie stadium today nor even about the fact that 16 of the last 17 american conference playoff games have now been won by the home team nor did the chargers feel a 310 loss , to the miami dolphins , is what inevitably happens when you build a 125 record by playing a relatively weak schedule after a fifthplace finish the year before we just took an oldfashioned licking on both sides of the ball , san diego coach bobby ross said particularly , we have n't had a game like this where we were so offsync in our throwing game nearrecord for futility san diego did n't quite rival the 1958 cleveland browns' record for offensive futility in the national football league playoffs a paltry 86 yards , against the giants it just seemed that way quarterback stan humphries , sacked just once but banged around much of the game , was at the center of the chargers' offensive woes he settled for 140 passing yards on 18 completions in 44 attempts , with 4interceptions and san diego totaled just 202 yards of offense i had one of these days you 'd like to forget for the rest of your life , humphries said i did n't throw the football well when i did , it was to them of his four interceptions , he said ruefully , the ball is in my hands a lot and i 've got to take care of it better than i did ross had noticed humphries s wildness before the game and noted that it carried into the game too far behind to run with rain pelting the field , san diego figured to rely heavily on its touted running game it could n't charger fullback marion butts , advertised as a threat to wear down miami s defense , wound up with 25 yards the visitors were averaging 46 yards a rush at halftime , but ran only three times in the second half i think we could have run for a lot more yardage , said butts it s just that when they went ahead by three touchdowns , it changed the complexion of the game the game had been touted in part as a match between charger defensive coordinator bill arnsparger , the former dolphins defensive boss , and longtime miami coach don shula arnsparger s forces flopped against the patient miami offense arnsparger , 66 years old and back in the league after a nineyear absence , was gracious in defeat he slipped out of the san diego locker room shortly before the news media was allowed in and visited the dolphins' locker room to offer congratulations twelve weeks i 've enjoyed it , he said of his return to the nfl , and six weeks i have n't quickness and skill the chargers had just nine players with playoff experience before this season and none with extensive experience i do n't think we can think of an excuse here , said a somber bobby beathard , the team s general manager i think the coach did a great job of not making the playoffs sound too big to our players and we thought the rain might help us , not hurt us ross said the main reason for the loss was the miami defense they 're an underrated defensive team , he said some people say they 're small , but i do n't see that they 've got great quickness and they defended us with great intensity and skill their whole team was focused and coming off a week of rest ross said he asked his players in his postgame speech to remember how they felt at game s end i want them to remember how much it hurts maybe if they have a tendency to not work out as much as they should , the memory will motivate them not to let this happen again
the giants have set no timetable , but they do know whom they want as their next head coach tom coughlin is the no 1 candidate dave wannstedt is no 2 and bill parcells is probably out of the picture the job became vacant wednesday when general manager george young dismissed ray handley after two disappointing seasons young said then that he had not decided on a successor , had not interviewed anyone and had not set up interviews with prospective coaches he also said he planned to interview more than one candidate but a person familiar with the giants' thinking said yesterday that coughlin would be the first to be interviewed and that if all went well , coughlin could be hired within days and without interviews of any other candidates he 'll be busy today coughlin is the head coach at boston college and a former giants assistant wannstedt is the assistant head coach and defensive coordinator of the dallas cowboys parcells was the giants' head coach from 1983 through 1990 , with two super bowl victories in his eight seasons when he resigned suddenly in may 1991 , handley was promoted from offensive coordinator to head coach coughlin is 46 years old , wannstedt 41 and parcells 51 coughlin s boston college team will play tennessee today in the hall of fame bowl in tampa , fla coughlin has refused to discuss the giants job until after the game at last report , he planned to fly back to boston with his team after the game and thus would be available for an interview with young as early as tomorrow the cowboys are in the national football league playoffs and will not play their first game until next weekend if dallas keeps winning , wannstedt may be coaching until super bowl xxvii on jan 31 in pasadena , calif because of pending free agency for many veterans and the scoutingcombine workouts for prospective draftees , young would like the new coach at work relatively soon jimmy johnson , the cowboys' head coach , said he would allow wannstedt to be interviewed now for a headcoaching job wannstedt said he was thinking only of the task at hand for the cowboys , but he did say he would be interested in a headcoaching job the friction may be hard to forget weeks ago , when it appeared obvious that handley would be dismissed , parcells seemed the favorite to succeed him parcells was popular with the public , a bluecollar , selfstyled jersey guy who had made the giants winners but there was a gnawing feeling that young would be uncomfortable with parcells , just as he was during parcells s eight years as head coach while their business relationship was professional , parcells wanted more control of some situations , notably the draft in addition , young may still have questions stemming from parcells s untimely resignation 20 months ago it came two months before the start of training camp and after the scoutingcombine workouts , plan b free agency , the draft and a minicamp had already taken place that left his successor with little time to reshape the team and that team was aging , especially on defense , with few young players ready to make major contributions parcells has never fully explained his resignation he knew the team was facing a difficult transition and he was probably suffering from , or at the edge of , coaching burnout but his main concern was his health , which he says is fine now after subsequent bypass surgery in his two seasons away from the giants , parcells has been a profootball analyst for nbc television while he has kept a close watch on his old team , he has tried to avoid making public comments on the team or handley s performance he had no comment wednesday or yesterday on handley or the giants' job none of them played in pros coughlin \( pronounced cawflin \) offers many positives he coached with the giants before \( so did handley on the same staff \) he had a reputation with the giants as being tough but fair he might keep some of handley s assistants , which would not be required , but would please young and his boston college players seem to like him and enjoy playing for him coughlin and wannstedt , like parcells , did not play pro football coughlin was a young head coach at rochester tech \( 196973 \) , then an assistant at syracuse \( 197480 \) and boston college \( 198183 \) , then the receivers coach for the philadelphia eagles \( 198485 \) , the green bay packers \( 198687 \) and the giants \( 198890 \) wannstedt was an assistant at pittsburgh \( 197578 \) , oklahoma state \( 197982 \) , southern california \( 198385 \) and miami \( 198688 \) in 1989 , when johnson left miami to coach the cowboys , he took wannstedt with him
summer house' revival the stage at the vivian beaumont theater at lincoln center , empty since january , will be busy again beginning july 16 , with the seasonably titled play in the summer house , by jane bowles a 14character drama about obsessive relationships between mothers and daughters , the play was first produced on broadway 40 years ago it s a poetic play , and also an interesting example of american surrealism , said andre bishop , the artistic director of lincoln center theater the announcement , which was made yesterday , is especially newsworthy because the play was suggested to mr bishop by the woman who will direct it joanne akalaitis , the recently discharged artistic director of the joseph papp public theater who , like the beaumont , could be said to be emerging from a dark episode welcome back to both autumn jostling spring has sprung , and april , broadway s busiest month , has been declared off broadway month by mayor david n dinkins , so in the spirit of paradox , let s look at the fall so the pendulum swings there will , it seems , be a fall season this year , with two musicals set for the cavernous nederlander theaters and a seemingly surefire commercial comedy and a serious drama from ireland announced and shopping for homes in addition , the kentucky cycle , robert schenkkan s pulitzerwinning epic , is a decent bet so is the revival of my fair lady starring richard chamberlain , which opens a road tour this weekend but even if these last two do n't happen , last fall should be eclipsed the revival of joseph and the amazing technicolor dreamcoat , now at the pantages theater in los angeles , is due at the minskoff , perhaps by september \( but also perhaps not until next spring \) , and a new musical , the red shoes comes to the gershwin in october \( as a warmup , the nederlander organization is bringing robert goulet and the road company of camelot to the gershwin for a limited run beginning in june \) cy coleman s musical the life , is breathing out there somewhere so is a dutch musical adaptation of cyrano de bergerac laughter on the 23d floor , neil simon s comedy about comedy writers , probably will get here in october , at the richard rodgers if it s available , though fool moon is running strong there at about the same time , brian friel s wonderful tennessee will land on 45th street somewhere , most likely the royale , now dark , though many of broadway s unofficial handicappers think the plymouth may be available as well \( regrets to jacob zulu and friends \) and a couple of wild cards could require a shubert shuffle maggie smith and the importance of being earnest , now in london , and julie andrews in putting it together , the sondheim revue at the manhattan theater club of course what comes is somewhat dependent on what goes , which is anybody s guess a dozen or so of broadway s chiefest anybodies were asked to prognosticate this week , and encouraged by the promise of anonymity they did so by unanimous reckoning , miss saigon , les miserables , the phantom of the opera , cats , crazy for you , guys and dolls and the sisters rosensweig will all endure the year two other good wagers are angels in america , which arrives in three weeks with great expectations , and tommy , which on the basis of early previews is already being called a sleeper success that could be a genuine hit , particularly if it cops the tony for best musical prevailing wisdom has it that unless will rogers follies pulls out of its current doldrums and has a strong summer , its twoyear run at the palace is nearing an end the future of jelly s last jam , at the virginia , depends largely on whether the audience responds to a new cast and the goodbye girl , even with its large advance sale , faces problems after labor day when bernadette peters and martin short are scheduled to depart fool moon is doing surprisingly good business and should be around \( though perhaps not at the rodgers neil simon can be persuasive \) unless the performers decide not to be david shiner has another offer someone who 'll watch over me has had a surprising run at the booth , helped by stephen rea s sudden film stardom , but with the oscars now past , few think it will skate through the summer without problems redwood curtain , even with strong reviews \( they were decidedly mixed after the opening this week \) , would be a hard sell , and a lifepreserving tony seems doubtful no one is willing to bet on or against falsettos , mainly because nobody gave it much of a chance to begin with and five guys named moe , though barely hanging on , it seems one week in march the gross fell to 85 , 000 , about 25 percent of potential does have the tenacity of cameron mackintosh behind it though it s premature and perhaps unfair , the broadway watchers consulted this week were not exactly bullish on the three musicals set to open in the next few weeks ai n't broadway grand , blood brothers and kiss of the spider woman none of which have had auspicious advance sales the theaters that will house them could well be in the mix for the fall by the end of the year , then , expect the following cyrano at the neil simon mr simon himself at the richard rodgers fool moon elsewhere , perhaps the broadhurst my fair lady at the marquis or the luntfontanne maggie smith at the plymouth brian friel at the royale kentucky cycle at the music box or , of course , none of the above the stars come out barbra streisand , who will produce and direct the film adaptation of larry kramer s 1985 angrified

gouverneur , ny , june 10 the events that took place behind locked doors at the casablanca restaurant and bar in the early morning hours of oct 26 , 1991 , are no longer in dispute a 24yearold local woman , a hospital technician , passed out in the women s restroom after too many free drinks her date , the son of the gouverneur police chief , was asleep outside in his pickup truck five men in their 20 s who were acquaintances of the woman carried her to a dining room booth , undressed her , and four of them had sexual intercourse with her while she was unconscious or , at best , semiconscious 'my body , my soul' after hearing what they did to my body , my soul , i want them lined up on a platform and hung , the victim said in a statement she prepared for the sentencing of the five defendants on june 5 but all five walked free after they were each fined 750 and each ordered to pay 90 in court costs by the local town justice , who is not a lawyer it was the culmination of nearly 20 months of rumor , confessions , grand jury indictments and plea bargaining the abrupt end to the case caused shock and soulsearching among those who could not fathom why the criminal justice system did not exact a higher penalty from men who admitted complicity in a serious sexual crime the uproar echoed debates from other muchpublicized sexual assault cases like the one involving high school athletes and a retarded schoolmate in glen ridge , nj some 100 people marched in protest over the handling of the case and several area newspapers have called for the resignation of district attorney richard v manning , who approved the plea bargain that reduced felony charges of firstdegree rape down to misdemeanor charges of sexual misconduct others have asked the state to investigate whether local political pressure had influenced the outcome in this closeknit mining and farming village of 5 , 000 residents , most of whom know the victim and her assailants clover forsythe , a sister of the victim , complained bitterly about the sentence in an interview this week no jail time , no probation , and it was n't even the maximum fine , she said the victim declined to be interviewed for this article wallace a sibley , the parttime town justice , defended the sentences , saying the fines were the largest he had ever given to firsttime offenders mr sibley is a former cattlefeed company employee and bus driver state law does not required that a town justice be a lawyer the defendants mark a hartle , 27 mariano g pistolesi , 29 david e cummings , 27 michael curcio , 23 , and gregory l streeter , 27 were indicted by a grand jury last year on firstdegree rape charges that carry penalties of 25 years in prison the grand jury was read statements that four of the five men gave to state police investigators in which they admitted taking part in the sexual assault , lawenforcement officials said nevertheless , the district attorney concluded earlier this year that he was unable to obtain enough other evidence to try the felony case in an interview , mr manning explained that the victim was unaware she had been raped until two weeks after the assault when friends informed her that the men were boasting about it by that time forensic tests for physical evidence , like the presence of sperm , could no longer produce conclusive results , he added the incident occurred about 2 am , and the woman was driven home about three hours later by one of the assailants after she woke up , mr manning said when her boyfriend woke up in his truck , he found the restaurant locked , concluded his girlfriend had gotten a ride and went home alone , the police said trial is avoided instead of going to trial , mr manning agreed to a deal that allowed all five defendants named in the indictment to plead guilty to the lesser charge of sexual misconduct mr manning maintains he informed the victim about the changes and said she approved them however , the victim , her family , friends and a number of others connected with the case claim that she expressed her opposition to the lesser charges and pressed mr manning to proceed with the criminal trial unequivocally , what the district attorney is saying now is not the truth , said jennifer b baird , director of the rape crisis center operated by citizens against violent acts , an advocacy group in canton , the seat of st lawrence county , near the canadian border he may have taken the only legal recourse he felt was called for in this case by plea bargaining , but he never asked for or got her approval , said ms baird , who noted that the woman contacted her agency for counseling robert n wells , a professor of government at st lawrence university , said , people s sense of decency was outraged by the district attorney plea bargaining firstdegree rape charges down to a misdemeanor a misdemeanor can be punished by a 1 , 000 fine , one year in jail and requirements for probation mr sibley was reported to be out of town this week and did not return messages left at his office and home mr manning , however , took time off from trying another rape case to defend his actions 'vicious and sleazy' first , he expressed dismay that the five defendants had managed to escape more severe punishment what they did was immoral , vicious and sleazy , he said they should have gotten more than a fine
consider , for a moment , the kaleidoscopic and farflung interests of kenneth feld , owner of the world s largest live entertainment company a replica of the space shuttle that mr feld owns and leases to the kennedy space center is visited by 5 , 000 to 7 , 000 people a day and is now on its way to south korea for an exposition ice skaters employed in his five walt disney world on ice shows are twirling in arenas from milwaukee to east asia the illusionists siegfried roy are in the third year of a recordbreaking run at the mirage hotel in las vegas , nev the finishing touches are being put on a george lucas s super live adventure , a multimedia spectacle that mr feld is taking to lucasmad japan in late april and on broadway , david shiner and bill irwin are packing them in to fool moon , a critically acclaimed comedy that mr feld is coproducing and tomorrow , the cornerstone of mr feld s business , the ringling brothers and barnum bailey circus , 123 years old and three rings full of brandname recognition that rivals kleenex and coke , opens a fiveweek run at madison square garden we are the walmart of the entertainment business , mr feld said in an interview in the small office his company keeps on west 45th street in manhattan we give a great product at the best price there is mr feld has cause to sound satisfied at a time when much of show business is in retreat , victimized by recession , high ticket prices , television and videocassette recorders , irvin feld and kenneth feld productions , the corporate umbrella under which the circus and all of mr feld s other shows operate , had its best year ever in the 12 months ended jan 31 , mr feld said and he says the prospects for 1993 seem bright the trends for the first six months are incredible , mr feld said i do n't ever remember seeing anything like the increases we are seeing in terms of advanced ticket sales price is one reason his shows remain so popular , mr feld believes in most of the 90 cities the circus plays each year , the top ticket costs 15 \( madison square garden is an exception ringside seats cost 2750 \) it s a business that is very price sensitive , mr feld said if you raise prices by 1 a ticket you can see a reaction a privately held company , feld productions will not talk specifically about how much money it takes in , let alone how much it makes indeed , for the last six years mr feld has told any reporter who asked that annual revenues were around 250 million i used that number once , and then i decided not to give any more numbers out , he said but other people who follow the company s operations say revenues are probably double that amount a slight , unassuming , engaging man , mr feld , who is 44 , has been running the company that owns the circus since 1984 , when his father , irvin , died widely hailed as the man who saved the circus , irvin feld , his brother israel and judge roy hofheinz , who built the houston astrodome , bought the ailing ringling brothersbarnum bailey combined shows inc from john ringling north in 1967 for 8 million moved circus indoors none of the new owners had any circus experience irvin feld , who had been promoting rockandroll concerts , made two decisions that were critical to the circus s future to attract bigger crowds , mr feld got rid of the big top and moved the circus indoors and to keep his product fresh , and spread out production costs , he created a second unit in 1969 one new show would be created each year , and each unit , the red and the blue , would be on the road for two years between them , the two circuses will do 550 shows in 90 cities across the country this year those were not irvin feld s only innovations he also created ringling s clown college in 1968 , which kenneth feld likes to call research and development spending with an acrobat or an aerialist who perform a specific act , even if it s great or memorable , i still have a problem with them in the third year , because by then everybody has seen the act , he said but if i get a good clown i would like to keep him or her forever now , mr feld is thinking of creating a broader circus college to nurture talent , now that the collapse of communism and the breakup of the soviet union have threatened the many statesupported circuses throughout eastern europe that have been a source of many ringling acts florida elephant farm an eye on the future also led mr feld to set up a 20acre elephant farm in florida more than seven years ago at age 123 , the circus can fairly be called a mature enterprise so to spur growth , mr feld has chosen to stretch his entrepreneurial legs into areas of entertainment his father might not have considered and he appears to have bolstered the company s huge concession operations , which add mightily to ringling s bottom line his father was far more conservative in nature , said tim holst , ringling s vice president of talent and production kenneth

more home cooking a writer returns to the kitchen by laurie colwin 224 pp new york harpercollins publishers 22 laurie colwin , who died last year at 48 , was best known for her gently told tales of contemporary domestic life on the surface her novels and stories are modest , as deceptively simple as a plate of fresh biscuits but take a bite , and you discover a subtle , perfectly executed balance of tenderness and tang colwin might have enjoyed that comparison , because she also wrote frequently about food \( including an essay on biscuits , a staple she loved and maintained would never fail you \) more home cooking is her second collection of food writings , a number of which have never been printed before , though the majority appeared in gourmet magazine her fans will cherish this final volume , and rightly so , for the cozy , unpretentious good sense that characterizes all her food writing is here in abundance but even her fans should probably read these nibbles of prose one at a time , leaving a day or more between dips into the book hardcover publication rarely brings out the best in journalism , especially in light , personal musings like these the repetitions and the stylistic tics that probably went unnoticed when they were written now jump out as if highlighted in yellow marker more important , the material is a little frail read in the course of a single sitting , it tends to disintegrate how to roast chicken without being obsessed by it , how delicious tomatoes are , ways to use up fresh corn each essay on its own has the power to charm and enlighten , but none have a great deal of heft read as they were meant to be , laurie colwin s food thoughts are like phone calls from a dear friend one day she s excited about eggs , rhapsodizing about sunnyside up , making a pitch for freerange , recalling a blissful meal of duck eggs another day she s absorbed in chocolate cake and a recipe she found years ago in a children s book for her , the most evocative aspect of any dish is its context in daily life the season and the ingredients and the occasion and the hunger that give rise to a black bean soup or a succotash and make those dishes immortal perhaps her greatest gift as a food writer is her love for good food writing , wherever it appears when she offers a recipe from one of her old , treasured cookbooks or summons up an era of children s books in which mothers had fresh gingerbread and cold milk waiting when the children came home from school , she s not just sharing food ideas , she s opening her library an act that must have been akin to opening her heart to get the maximum pleasure from more home cooking , go ahead and bake the gingerbread , and then turn to those children s books finally , curl up with a cup of coffee and a piece of gingerbread and read , read all afternoon

court papers filed in connection with the world trade center bombing say for the first time that a confidential informer provided information to investigators about the activities of mohammed a salameh , the first suspect arrested in the feb 26 explosion the papers , filed by mr salameh s lawyer , reveal that an affidavit in support of a government search warrant contended that the informer accompanied mr salameh to a new jersey apartment where wiring and electronic components used for making detonators were later seized the informer was said to have helped mr salameh learn to drive a van approximately two days before the world trade center explosion robert e precht , the lawyer for mr salameh , asked that the prosecution be ordered to identify the tipster we 're asking for an opportunity to interview this individual , mr precht said if the fbi wants him to wear a hood , that s fine mr salameh , a 25yearold palestinian in the united states illegally , was arrested on march 4 , when he tried to retrieve a 400 deposit he had put down on a ryder van federal authorities have repeatedly said they were led to mr salameh through the van s vehicle identification number found in the trade center s garage a storage locker , where the government says the bomb chemicals were kept , was searched the next day the mention of an informer in the search warrants raises the possibility that federal agents could have been given crucial leads by someone from inside mr salameh s inner circle almost immediately after the bombing the prosecution now contends that the conspiracy to bomb the world trade center began as early as july 1 , 1992 but it is not known when the informer began cooperating with the federal bureau of investigation , how close he was to mr salameh , where the individual is now , and how significant his information has been to the progress of the investigation mr precht said the affidavit made clear that the informer was a man there are a number of possibilities , mr precht said the most innocuous explanation is that there was an innocent citizen who was asked by one of the defendants to show him how to drive a ryder van he added , the other end of the extreme was that that there was a paid informant working for the fbi , not only witnessing the events , but participating he also suggested that his client could have been entrapped mr precht said that federal district judge kevin t duffy had denied his request for information that was filed last friday , but that he had asked him to reconsider he also said he had made his motion under seal but that the court had mistakenly filed the document publicly an investigator , who spoke yesterday on the condition of anonymity , said only that a number of informers had been providing information on the case from the very beginning , but that none of the defendants themselves was cooperating six suspects have now been charged directly in the bombing and one of them is still being sought a seventh is being held for resisting a search of his apartment and possessing five fraudulent passports federal investigators subpoenaed several of the suspects yesterday for saliva samples , which could be used for genetic testing mr precht s court papers say the informer claimed he had accompanied mr salameh to premises at 40 pan rapo avenue , apparently a reference to an apartment at 40 pamrapo avenue in jersey city in addition , the informer claimed that he had helped mr salameh a notoriously bad driver , according to his record learn how to drive the ryder van according to a jersey city man who says he was interviewed by the fbi , mr salameh and another man moved into the twobedroom pamrapo avenue apartment on jan 1 and moved out around midnight feb 28 the second tenant was not identified difficulty obtaining license an odorless powderblue substance was found splashed over the walls and ceiling of one bedroom , so dramatically that later visitors thought the former tenants had been painting a special design but fbi chemists later removed samples of the material , including chemicals they deemed corrosive if not explosive mr salameh failed tests for a new jersey driver s license four times , but finally received a new york state driver s license , using the address of ibrahim a elgabrowny , who is being held for resisting a search of his brooklyn apartment in the month before the trade center explosion , mr salameh was involved in two auto accidents one occurred about 2 am on jan 24 at an entrance to the complex of apartments where another suspect , mahmud abouhalima lived in avenel , nj mr salameh and another bombing suspect who was in the car , ramzi ahmed yousef , now the object of an international manhunt , were both taken by ambulance to rahway hospital mr salameh s other crash occurred about 2 30 pm on feb 16 , 10 days before the explosion , on west side avenue in jersey city , less than a mile from the storage depot where chemicals reportedly used in the bomb were found he was driving a car that another suspect , nidal a ayyad , had rented from national car rental and he sideswiped a car driven by a woman from bayonne mr ayyad was a passenger in the car at the time of the crash
florham park , nj , aug 3 after a season of doubt , despair and rehabilitation , the giants' sean landeta is trying to regain the form that has made him the national football league s eighthranking career punter with a 434yard average so far , so good , which pleases everyone here at the giants' camp because there are always fears that a 31yearold kicker in his 12th pro season has few punts left the 1992 season , although a loss from the beginning for the giants , had started off well for landeta he was coming off big games against the denver broncos \( six punts for a 51yard average \) and the green bay packers \( five punts for a 524yard average \) on the next sunday of the giants' disastrous season , disaster struck landeta as vai sikahema of the philadelphia eagles was returning a punt 87 yards for a touchdown , landeta reached out for a diving tackle he never got there the anterior cruciate ligament in landeta s left \( nonkicking \) knee snapped , meaning his season was over , reconstructive surgery was ahead and his career was in danger coach dan reeves tried to ease landeta s mind during his recovery before camp began , he told landeta not to worry about preseason games , but to aim at the season opener sept 5 against the bears in chicago eric bruun will probably do all the punting saturday night when the giants play the bengals in cincinnati in their preseason opener 'right on schedule' that s ok by me , landeta said today i'm doing well i'm right on schedule i told dan before camp that i 'd like to go the first couple of weeks easy , 75 to 85 percent once i got rhythm and reps and i was hitting the ball close to game level , i would step it up so far , that s what s happened the last few days , i 've probably averaged 47 or 48 yards , with a hang time of 43 seconds i'm not getting the height and distance i normally get , but that s by design many people who 've had this surgery said you 're not going to be 100 percent for nine to 12 months but at six or seven months , you can be well enough to punt and good enough to play in a normal year , landeta starts punting at the beginning of may and will make 1 , 000 punts before training camp starts in midjuly this year , he had to wait until the beginning of june , and he got in only 500 punts before camp i went very slowly , he said it was very positive because although i was kicking only 20 yards , it did n't hurt that s a good sign on july 1 , i started to punt a little harder that s when i knew i would be ok it hurt me a little , but i could still hit it well enough to play it hurts very little now , but it s still there i have n't let this play with my head but to get hurt at a time when you 're playing better than you ever had , better than anyone else in the nfl , it bothers you a lot so i'm looking forward to playing again a big contract so are the giants in this season of opportunity for unrestricted free agents , landeta had freedom , but no assurances of health nevertheless , the giants gave him the most lucrative contract in history for a punter 32 million over four years , with 12 million this year alone landeta said he appreciated the vote of confidence he pledged to return the favor i have no doubt i 'll be ready for chicago , absolutely none , he said if everything goes the way it has been going , i will punt as well as i ever have maybe a little better photo the giants are hopeful that sean landeta will regain his form after having undergone surgery to repair his anterior cruciate ligament \( ray stubblebine for the new york times \)

mexico city , july 14 in a sudden reversal , the mexican government apparently bowed to american pressure today and agreed to take responsibility for 659 chinese refugees aboard three ships about 60 miles off the mexican coast that were intercepted by the coast guard while headed for the united states only hours after officials here had reiterated their stance that the smuggled chinese were an american problem , a senior official announced that mexico would allow the ships into port and then immediately return the immigrants to china the official , andres rozental , under secretary of foreign relations in charge of north america , said in an interview tonight that mexico was taking charge of the chinese purely on humanitarian grounds , because of the deteriorating shipboard conditions pressure from washington but privately , mexican and american officials confirmed that the united states had pressed mexico hard to help resolve the problem , which embarrassed the clinton administration only weeks after it announced a new policy to discourage illegal immigration some american officials had voiced concern that mexico s tough rejection of the united states request came at a particularly inopportune time only four months from now , the united states congress is to cast the decisive vote on the north american free trade agreement that is intended to eventually unite the united states , mexico and canada in a single , tarifffree zone mexico s demonstrated willingness to cooperate with the united states on nontrade issues is certain to weigh heavily in the vote mr rozental said that alexander watson , the united states assistant secretary of state for interamerican affairs , raised the issue of the immigrants in talks with senior mexican diplomats in mexico city on monday but mr rozental said , i do n't think there was any major pressure or anything still , the episode was the latest in a series that have seemed to define the relationship between the two countries on the basis of mexico s overwhelming desire to see the trade agreement passed the accord is expected to increase jobs and wages in mexico only slowly , but it is expected to quicken the flow of muchneeded foreign investment in mexico right away over the last year , mexico has prominently reversed itself several times in disputes with the united states , and almost every time mexican officials have acknowledged their fears for the trade agreement as a leading factor a united states official said that tonight , even while senior officials in the mexican foreign secretariat were publicly insisting that mexico was not negotiating over the fate of the chinese , and would not , other officials under president carlos salinas de gortari were continuing to hold out the possibility of mexican help decision is welcomed throughout this thing , there were some mexican officials who were irritated and were unwilling to cooperate on this , and others who were willing to cooperate to work this situation out , the american official said in a public statement in washington , martin judge , a state department spokesman , said we welcome mexico s humanitarian decision our discussions with mexico continue , and we are willing to cooperate with the mexican government in this matter mr judge said consultations on the immigation issue would continue thursday in mexico city tonight in washington , national security council and state department officials were so sensitive about the appearance of having pressured mexico that they would not discuss the nature of the talks that took place with mexico this week on monday , mr watson met in mexico city with foreign minister fernando solana morales to discuss the request that mexico accept the chinese refugees , mexican officials said but the foreign minister expressed his displeasure at the request and its timing , four days after the request was first reported in american newspapers , and the talks faltered , mexican officials said treatment of mexicans mexican diplomats had shown their ire at the american request for help with the chinese openly they suggested it was almost hypocritical to seek mexico s aid with the problem when , mexico maintains , the united states habitually mistreats some of the estimated two million mexican citizens who cross illegally into the united states each year for more than a year now , mexico also has been pushing the united states to change its immigration policies to guarantee undocumented mexican immigrants better treatment and to allow more mexicans living on the mexican side of the border and working in the united states to be allowed to cross legally mexican officials said they feared that the clinton administration s new harderline policy on keeping illegal immigrants out could have negative consequences for those goals but mr rozental insisted that mexico did not change its position in its written appeal to mexico for help last friday , mr rozental said , the united states had asked that mexico bring the three chinese boats into mexican ports , then process the smuggled aliens jointly with the united states and the united nations high commission on refugees to determine the validity of any claims of political persecution the united states said it would then assume the cost of sending the rest of the chinese , most of whom are believed to have paid thousands of dollars to be passed like chattel across the pacific mexico s own plan rather than accept those conditions , mexico came up with its own plan , mr rozental said he said the mexican authorities would only tow the chinese ships into port once they had made their way from their current position , about 70miles out to sea , to the 12mile limit of mexican territorial waters since one of the three ships is disabled and another is believed to be in precarious mechanical shape , mexican officials said they expected the united states to take charge of assisting the boats to the 12mile limit mexican officials added that , as is their policy , they would not hear any claims of asylum from the immigrants and though they have consistently accepted american compensation for processing thirdcountry immigrants in the past , they said they would reject an offer of united states financing this time these people were in really bad shape and in order not to prolong their suffering , we felt that we should get them back to china as soon as possible , mr rozental said persecuted or not \? a mexican official added we know very well that none of these people who are coming here are being persecuted the us knows that , too the only difference is that in the united states , the only thing you have to do is to step on american soil and cry asylum , and you get a hearing mr rozental said mexican diplomats had ascertained that more than 100 chinese repatriated by mexico in may had not been punished by the communist government but american immigration officials said an additional 112 chinese whom the united states repatriated around the same time were subsequently jailed and fined mexico has long prided itself on a generous policy of providing asylum to peoples fleeing politically motivated repression but last year , as mexico struggled to begin the repatriation of more than 40 , 000 guatemalan refugees who have been camped on its southern border for a decade , it expelled 123 , 050 illegal immigrants , many of whom it said were trying to cross into the united states for economic reasons they included people from india , latin americans and asians , 427 of them chinese mexico was especially angered in may , when about 200 chinese from a group seized in baja california escaped from the mexicali airport and fled toward the united states most were caught , but mexico was livid when the american authorities refused to allow the mexican plane deporting them to even refuel on alaskan soil photo mexico has agreed to take responsibility for the 659 chinese immigrants on three ships that were headed for the united states some of the chinese immigrants waited on monday aboard the to ching 212 while the coast guard detained the ship off the coast of baja

two women are walking side by side a man walks up and shoves one of them out of the way then he pulls a gun and shoots the other as she falls , he shoots her again , 12 times in all on monday , by happenstance , this scene at a cemetery in north lauderdale , fla , was recorded on videotape by telemundo , the spanishlanguage network a telemundo crew from miami was interviewing the man , emilio nunez , about his daughter s recent suicide when his former wife showed up and he shot her he had earlier told television crew members that he blamed his former wife for the suicide on tuesday , the tape was broadcast not only by telemundo but on the nbc nightly news and on many local newscasts around the country the broadcasts have prompted thousands of angry telephone calls to the stations and have set off a new round of public debate over when , if ever , such scenes of graphic violence should be shown 'it was a mistake' we broadcast the videotape , said dean daniels , news director of wcbs in new york in retrospect , he added , it was a mistake mr daniels declined to elaborate , but another wcbs executive , speaking on the condition of anonymity , said , it opened up this whole discussion of where do you draw the line to many television producers , the slaying of maritza nunez on camera posed the same discomfiting questions about sensationalism versus news value that they confronted six years ago when r budd dwyer , the pennsylvania state treasurer , shot himself during a news conference at that time , only a very small number of stations , including wpvi , the abc station in philadelphia , showed the film of mr dwyer as he put the gun in his mouth and pulled the trigger none of the three major broadcast networks showed mr dwyer s suicide this time , though , perhaps because the scene was somewhat less graphic or perhaps simply because public tolerance for explicit violence has increased , the tape of ms nunez s slaying received fairly wide exposure nationally , nbc ran the tape in its entirety in the new york area , wcbs ran the whole tape , wnbc ran an edited version and wabc ran none of the tape the new york times ran a photograph from the tape yesterday , tory beilinson , a spokeswoman for nbc , defended the network s decision to broadcast the tape of the killing , saying nbc news made the editorial decision to air the videotape because it illustrates the horror of domestic violence , which is an ongoing crisis that nbc is committed to covering fran mires , executive producer for the telemundo program occurio asi \( it happened this way \) , whose cameraman recorded ms nunez s slaying , explained her decision to show the tape by saying that it did not , in fact , look real it looks like a reenactment , she said ms mires made the tape available to other networks executives at networks that declined to broadcast the tape were quick to criticize those that did w thomas johnson , president of cable news network , said he had decided not to show the tape because it was unnecessarily graphic and i felt it smacked of sensationalism sometimes , he added , i worry that a report like this has a tendency to trigger other incidents tom goodman , a spokesman for the cbs evening news , said that his network had decided against broadcasting the tape because the overall news value of the story was n't important enough gore is n't always news critics of the news media who deplored the broadcast of the killing said that it was not the brutality of the scene that made it offensive it was the lack of a compelling reason to show such brutality there are occasions when death and blood are part of the news , said bob lichter , director of the center for media and public affairs in washington , citing war coverage as an example but if the only thing that puts this in the news is gore , that s wrong neil postman , chairman of the department of communication arts at new york university , said that the nunez slaying highlighted one of the great unresolved issues of television news whether compelling pictures should be allowed to dictate coverage events like this give people an opportunity to reflect not so much on why this thing was shown , but why anything is shown , he said what are we shown every night just because there s film footage \? photo shortly before being shot to death by her estranged husband , maritza nunez was pursued by a television reporter , left the broadcast of the videotape of the murder has set off a new round of debate over whether such graphic violence should be shown on television \( telemundo ocurrio asi , via associated press \)
like a longrunning broadway show , orso has remained vital and fresh despite many cast changes over the years this offshoot of the joe allen empire opened in 1985 when restaurant row on west 46th street seemed headed toward gastronomic senescence almost singlehandedly , orso brought back the broadway movers and shakers , instilling new life into the block orso s stepdown main dining room is dominated by a high arching skylight that creates a cheerful , sunny setting at lunch in the evening it creates a sense of spaciousness soft ocher tones and wood trim contribute to a casual , contemporary setting walls are covered with publicity photographs of sports and entertainment celebrities in the back an open tileandsteel kitchen churns out pizzas , pastas and appealing grilled fare orso s service style can be offputting if you order wine , a waiter or waitress brings it , removes the cork , plops the bottle on the table and leaves self service , they say a waiter explained that management feels this adds an easygoing trattoria feeling to the dining room this laid back attitude extends to servers not knowing who gets what dishes at the table , neglecting to refill water glasses and starting housecleaning while some customers are still in the room notwithstanding these lapses , the staff more often than not is good natured , helpful and hard working the changing menu carries nearly a dozen starters , a selection of small pizzas and a blend of north italian pastas and entrees the pizzas are still winners , thincrusted , crisp and fresh among the better ones are those topped with italian sausage , onions , mozzarella , parmesan and tomato sauce and eggplant , spinach and provolone fried calamari is hardly worth leaving guys and dolls early for more spongy than crisp , they get lost in a big green salad lentil and spinach soup is better , thick , herby and nicely textured , as is the wonderful smoky potato and cabbage soup a neapolitanstyle starter of baked eggplant was soothing and tasty , too , essentially a sandwich of sliced eggplant , molten ricotta and sliced tomatoes pastas are still a big draw a lusty mediterranean composite of shell pasta with black olives , tomatoes , green beans and garlic was tantalizing so , too , were fusilli with eggplant , pancetta , onions , tomato , mozzarella and onions taglierini is a summer winner , tossed with garlic , olive oil , broccoli rape , fava beans , olives and pecorino one of the best pastas sampled lately was a homey blend of tagliatelle in a veal stew sauce along with italian sausage , asparagus and parmesan orso has a sensible wine list that matches the food well whites begin at 16 and gradually ascend to 38 reds start at 15 and reach 43 plenty of good selections are available for under 25 main courses are not so steady as starters sauteed sweetbreads with artichokes were as bland as white bread and had a similar texture an overcooked halibut steak could not be rescued by summery tomatoandblackolive sauce , and roast pheasant one evening was paper dry snapper , on the other hand , arrived perfectly cooked and enlivened with sundried tomatoes , garlic and white beans garlicky sauteed spinach has an invigorating douse of fresh lemon one of the best seafood dishes is charred jumbo shrimp , sweet and smoky at the same time , with white beans and garlic grilled chicken with eggplant and broccoli rape makes for a light , satisfying lunch , as does grilled swordfish with orzoandvegetable salad when the menu offers spicy sausages it means it the lean , pepperlaced sausages are accompanied by firedousing polenta , olives and roasted sweet peppers a dessert that is making the rounds in italian restaurants these days is risotto rice pudding , often made with arborio rice the effort was in vain , however , for the texture was glutinous and the flavor nondescript better choices are the fresh figs mired in vanilla custard , amaretto cake with brandylaced mascarpone and mixed berries , or wellmade zabaglione with sliced bananas orso is hardly a flawless restaurant but what it lacks in consistency it makes up for in verve and lack of pretension after eight celebritypacked years , that is nice to see orso  322 west 46th street , manhattan , \( 212 \) 4897212 atmosphere sunny and casual setting with open kitchen and skylight service

the metaphysics of virtual reality by michael heim 175 pages oxford university press 21 back in the momentous year of 1968 , an image from stanley kubrick s scifi epic 2001 a space odyssey summed up society s fears of the dawning computer age hal , the cozily named renegade computer , quietly running amok and trying to seize control of a spaceship for its own diabolical ends twentyfive years later , with daily life permeated by hightech electronics , this adversarial view of artificial intelligence has given way to a different sort of anxiety about computers an anxiety about their collaborative role in our lives , their innate capacity to reshape the way we write , think , even perceive the world as the philosopher michael heim argues in his book the metaphysics of virtual reality what heidegger called 'the essence of technology' infiltrates human existence more intimately than anything humans could create the danger of technology lies in the transformation of the human being , by which human actions and aspirations are fundamentally distorted not that machines can run amok , or even that we might misunderstand ourselves through a faulty comparison with machines instead , technology enters the inmost recesses of human existence , transforming the way we know and think and will the author of an earlier book called electric language a philosophical study of word processing , mr heim argues here that the computer s effect on today s society is commensurate with that of the printing press on the 15thcentury world already , he points out , the computer has revolutionized fields as disparate as medicine , publishing and politics computerized instruments enable doctors to remove the gallbladder with only tiny incisions computer bulletin boards and fax machines facilitated the 1989 democratic uprising in china and computer innovations like hypertext \( a system that allows the user to jump from a primary text to related commentary and footnotes with a single keystroke \) are altering the writing and reading of literature by promoting a nonlinear , deconstructionist approach to narrative many of the computer s consequences are less obvious and potentially more insidious in the first place , the very amount of information that computers make available threatens us with cognitive overload overwhelmed with facts , people tend to mistake data for truth , knowledge for wisdom infomania erodes our capacity for significance , mr heim writes with a mindset fixed on information , our attention span shortens we collect fragments we become mentally poorer in overall meaning yet at the same time , he suggests , computers can foster a sense of godlike omniscience and control , that illusory feeling of security nurtured by a world in which everything has been numbered and counted and slotted it is a sense of power heightened further by the advent of virtual reality , that is , computergenerated worlds that enable a user to interact with an imaginary environment by allowing us to visit , say , an artificial tahiti or outer space or arthurian england , virtual reality worlds invite us to become voyeurs , promising experiences that are potentially more exciting than anything in real life and at the same time completely risk free the world of artificial reality , mr heim writes , may gradually erode the sense we have of the felt resistance of the real world realworld resistance has made us develop a mindset that contemplates , reflects and mentally digests matters by chewing them over slowly and thoughtfully festina lente goes the ancient roman proverb 'make haste , but make it slowly' lest it enervate it is mr heim s sensible view that every technological innovation has tradeoffs , that progress is always tied to losses , and he argues that computers \( and virtual reality \) can be used , much like the force in star wars , for good or ill while virtual reality could evolve into a new kind of participatory art form , appealing to the senses of sight , sound and touch , mr heim suggests , it might also feed people s escapist tendencies , encouraging them to avoid the duties of real life and the prompting of their inner selves while computer communication \( including email , faxes and electronic bulletin boards \) could help counter the growing atomization of society , connecting people across vast distances and cultures , it might also lead to strangely detached , outofbody relationships in which ethical awareness shrinks and traditional social etiquette is ignored as interesting as some of mr heim s observations are , none of them are fully developed because this volume is composed of essays written for assorted publications , it has an improvised , unfinished quality phrases are repeated from chapter to chapter , while ideas are sketchily laid in , then summarily abandoned computer terminology unfamiliar to the nonexpert is tossed about in some chapters , while other chapters belabor obvious concepts in the end , the reader wishes mr heim had not lazily strung together a series of articles but had used his considerable expertise to write an original book on the same topic photo of

responding to lawsuits by new york state and three environmental groups , the federal environmental protection agency has proposed rules that would further reduce acid rain by depriving electric utilities of some of the allowances permitting them to emit pollutants the new regulations , proposed without fanfare last month , have been denounced by the utility industry utility companies say the rules are being issued so late that there is no way of making them a part of the utilities' planning for an acidrain cleanup that by law must begin in 1995 one of the industry s opponents , timothy j burke , executive director of the adirondack council , called the rules a major victory and said they would cut emissions of sulfur dioxide , which causes acid rain , by a cumulative total of two million tons over five years , 1995 through 1999 the council was one of the parties bringing suit , because the adirondacks are believed to be one of the areas most vulnerable to damage to woods and lakes from acid rain but the environmental protection agency gave a more modest estimate of the effects of its proposed regulations the agency said that if the rules are adopted , as is expected early next year after a period of public comment , sulfur dioxide emissions would be cut by about a million tons over that fiveyear period that would mean a total fiveyear reduction of 15 million tons of sulfur dioxide under the overall governmentmandated program to attack acid rain that compares with a reduction of 14 million tons if the program proceeded under earlier rules , issued by the environmental agency at the beginning of this year flexibility rules at issue it was those earlier rules , laying out how the utilities must achieve the acidrain goals mandated by the clean air act of 1990 , that brought suits against the agency by the adirondack council , the natural resources defense council , the environmental defense fund and the new york state department of environmental conservation at issue in the dispute was how flexible utilities could be in reaching a goal set by the law cutting the current annual level of 20 million tons of sulfur dioxide emissions in half starting in the year 2000 one way was allowances a utility that did not pollute as much as the law allowed could sell its excess rights to a utility that polluted above the legal cap the law also allowed utilities to earn extra pollution credits , a scheme tied to the two phases of the cleanup program phase 1 , from 1995 to 1999 , required the companies to reduce pollution emitted by about 110 plants , generally the largest and dirtiestphase 2 , beginning in 2000 , required them to clean up the hundreds of others but under the law , the utilities could earn credits by cleaning up phase 2 plants early and could use those credits to reduce their phase 1 obligations the problem , as environmentalists saw it , was that the law set a base year of 1985 that meant that companies that had cleaned up phase 2 plants as much as five years before the clean air act was passed , in some cases because state governments had required them to do so , could claim credits for those cleanups so that they could delay reducing sulfur dioxide at their phase 1 plants new base year the effect , the environmentalists said , was to transform a provision aimed at flexibility into a loophole that allowed the companies to do less work and emit more pollution in phase 1 the new regulations proposed by the environmental agency last month would address that issue by preventing the utilities from claiming any phase 2 credits for cleanups that were performed before 1991 , the year after congress enacted the law in attacking the new rules , spokesmen for the electric power industry described them as not only too late but also unfair norman w fichthorn , a lawyer for the utility air regulatory group , a washingtonbased trade association , said some utilities saw the handwriting on the wall in the late 1980 s and took the environmentally responsible step of reducing sulfur dioxide emissions then , before they were required to do so they should not be punished , he said , through denial of credits for those cleanups one of the companies that would have fewer allowances as a result of the change is american electric power , an investorowned utility based in ohio , that stands to lose credits whose current market value totals about 2 million a year john m mcmanus , the company s director of acid rain compliance , complained that after going through an extensive process that led to the first set of regulations , the epa decided on their own that they would come out with a revision the old rules , he said , should stand uncertainty is increased in addition , utility spokesmen said rules changes like these only added to industry uncertainty that was already discouraging the pollutioncredit trading that congress intended to promote the utility industry , by nature generally conservative , has been skittish about buying and selling in a market where it has no experience , and as a result this market has been slow to develop the epa has changed its mind once already , said mary k o'toole , system environmental engineer at commonwealth edison in chicago if there was hesitancy to trade before , it s going to be increased now still , none of the several utility executives interviewed foresaw major financial damage as a result of the change indeed , some companies those that continue to earn extra credits would presumably benefit , since the price of allowances would rise as the supply was reduced in the thin trading thus far , the current market price for the right to emit a ton of sulfur dioxide is about 180 , less than half what some utility executives had predicted
washington , july 13 ten days after the coast guard stopped three ships trying to smuggle 659 chinese into california , senior officials in the clinton administration continued to argue over solutions none attractive to the increasingly difficult and embarrassing situation as the united states continued to press the mexican government to accept the refugees , the crowded , fetid ships remained about 100 miles southwest of san diego , surrounded by coast guard cutters the ships represent the first test of the clinton administration s vow to crack down on illegal immigration , a vow made after another smuggler s ship , the golden venture , spilled nearly 300 illegal chinese immigrants onto new york s shores last month even as it wavered over action on the three ships , the administration said today that it would back tough new legislation on asylum seekers ejected the same day the measure will allow quick and summary hearings for people who request asylum at airports and other ports of entry , and would stiffen penalties against alien smugglers government officials and others familiar with the plan say it includes charging alien smugglers under the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act as a result it will allow federal prosecutors to seize the assets of smugglers , including ships like the golden venture under the bill , a corps of immigration officers will screen aliens caught trying to enter the country without proper documents to determine if their asylum claims are worthy to be heard by an immigration judge those whose claims are deemed frivolous could be placed on airplanes and sent back to their country of origin on the same day they arrived in the united states under current immigration law , an alien s statement that he has a wellfounded fear of persecution is generally sufficient to allow him to be scheduled for a hearing the hearing process can take years , during which the applicant is generally allowed to stay in the united states immigration experts say that in 1992 about 14 , 000 people tried to enter the country without documents or by using fraudulent documents and then claimed asylum a sizeable percentage of them turned up at kennedy international airport in new york , the experts said unpleasant alternatives the bill , which is to be announced when president clinton returns to washington , was drafted by congressional staffs and an interagency task force made up of officials from the justice department , the state department , the office of management and budget and the white house for the last 10 days , senior officials of the departments of state , defense , justice and transportation and the central intelligence agency have been struggling with the problem of the three ships off mexico the officials are considering these alternatives , immigration officials said allow the refugees into the united states and hear their pleas for political asylum state department and immigration service officials vow they will not let that happen dragoon the refugees onto a united states navy vessel and ship them back to china but the navy wants no part of that plan , immigration officials said force the home nation of the freighters to take their human cargo no one is sure of the ships' true flags two of the ships claimed taiwanese registry , an assertion the government of taiwan denies 'usa i love you' the united states imposed a news blackout on the ships today , keeping the faces of the chinese passengers waving signs usa i love you and bread we want , freedom we want off television and out of the newspapers no responsible official would comment publicly on the stranded refugees , the sofar fruitless talks with the mexican government or the implications for the new policy of preventing boatloads of immigrants from applying for political asylum the state department spokesman , michael mccurry , said it was obvious that this is a sensitive matter of diplomacy he also said it was being addressed with urgency on the part of the officials here in the united states that are dealing with it , and added , we remain in contact with the mexican government on the issue of mexico s accepting the refugees such contacts were at best strained senior mexican officials insisted that they would not take on the immigration problems of the united states , and expressed fury at the way the situation has been handled a backlog of applications simply put , the administration wants to prevent the chinese refugees aboard the ship from applying for political asylum in the united states the system has dueprocess requirements and legal protections that can take months and years to fulfill it is hardpressed to handle its backlog of applications 10 , 000 new requests a month , and 300 , 000 people on a waiting list the united states also wants to prevent a repeat of the june 6 wreck of the golden venture , in which 10 chinese died trying to swim ashore all but 14 of the 301 illegal immigrants who survived the beaching are still being detained in immigration and naturalization service prisons in pennsylvania and louisiana , an ins spokeswoman said yesterday by intercepting the three ships at sea , the united states aims to send a signal that might stop tens of thousands of chinese people from paying smugglers tens of thousands of dollars apiece to take them to the united states in the filthy holds of freighters
even as states and cities are breaking free of the recession , buoyed by rising revenues from sales and income taxes , officials in the nation s counties say they are facing one of the worst years since the recession began county governments which provide everything from roads and health care to police and fire protection are suffering because they rely on property taxes for 75 percent of their own revenues cities , by contrast , rely on property taxes for 40 percent of their revenue real estate taxes , which are based on real estate values , fell sharply in the recession and will recover slowly because of legal and practical constraints most counties are raising tax rates to try to offset the decline , but most are also sharply reducing services to balance their budgets counties in the worst fiscal shape are those with legal restraints on tax increases last year was the worst of the recession for county budgets , and this year looks just as bad things are going to get worse before they get better , said ralph tabor , legislative director of the national association of counties no matter how strongly the economy comes back , counties will still be hurting for several years because residential construction in the suburbs has pretty much stopped and commercial vacancy rates are high everywhere cuts in services the group has just completed a survey of the nation s 66 largest counties , where onethird of americans live it found that more than 70 percent of the counties had reduced services and raised property taxes last year , and just as many said they planned to take these same measures again this year counties vary in function from state to state , but as their fiscal problems deepen , the 98 percent of americans who receive county services are likely to feel the pinch as counties reduce financing to schools , libraries , hospitals , highways , courts , prosecutors , public defenders and police and fire departments only connecticut and rhode island do not have county governments counties in these states are little more than lines on a map many large , urban counties include municipalities in their jurisdiction , and some , like san francisco and new york , have consolidated citycounty governments revenues falling new york , as a combination of city and county governments , is second only to los angeles county in population and second to none in spending new york city has enormous problems with its property tax revenues , but its problems are indicative of those faced in most urban counties since 1990 the city s property values have declined 16 percent , to 303 billion from 352 billion , according to city finance officials last year alone there was a 21 billion decline in the market value of real estate , and property owners , primarily owners of office buildings , have already received 2 billion in reduced assessments that reduction translates into a 350 million decline in real estate revenue for the fiscal year 1994 , which begins july 1 property tax revenues are projected to be about 8 billion , or half of the city s locally generated income squeeze in colorado in colorado , 23 of the state s 63 counties faced declines in their overall property assessments , but they cannot raise property tax rates to make up for the shortfall , at least for now a new state law , approved by voters last year , requires a popular vote on any proposed tax increase by any level of government i do n't know how they are going to keep their schools going , said karen k reinertson , the state budget director california s counties are also hard hit by declining property values and legal restrictions on increasing property taxes property values in the state have fallen by tens of billions of dollars during the recession , and property owners have received billions of dollars in property tax relief , state officials say precise numbers are unavailable but no matter how quickly the real estate market rebounds , state law generally limits increases in assessments to 2 percent a year the law , which voters enacted as proposition 13 on the 1978 state ballot , permits greater increases in assessments under some conditions , including the sale of a property supporting a population boom counties with the most problems are often ones that grew rapidly in the 1980 s and now lack money to provide services for their growing populations san diego county , calif , which saw its population increase to 25 million from 16 million during the decade , has depended on its annual 12 percent increase in real estate tax assessments to keep expanding services but the growth in those assessments , and the tax revenue along with it , shrank to 82 percent in 1991 and 46 percent last year the boom ended in 1990 , and it was just like hitting a brick wall , said manuel a lopez , director of financial management for the county the county has coped with its fiscal crisis by reducing health and social services and by not opening a new jail for 1 , 200 prisoners that was completed in 1990 a time of 'ugly decisions' in fairfax county , va , facing a 200 million deficit in last year s 13 billion general fund budget , officials raised property taxes by about 5 percent and hoped to raise taxes on restaurant meals but voters rejected the meal tax in a ballot measure so we had to cut the heck out of education and human services , said tom davis , chairman of the county board of supervisors we made the ugly decisions last year , so we 're in better shape this coming fiscal year prince georges county , md , reduced services across the board , eliminated 1 , 200 of 5 , 500 jobs and stripped costly provisions for things like wage increases , holiday pay and cost of living adjustments for police officers , firefighters and other employees these are unusual times , said marita b brown , director of the county s office of management and budget and taxpayers are starting to understand that they will pay more and get less chart a tough year for counties , partial list for 1992 survey of 66 large counties by the national association of counties , showing some actions taken that lowered revenues , some

mtv is planning to expand its music video empire to latin america in october , at which point the only continent where the american cable channel is not seen will be antarctica the channel s ambitious international expansion , which began in 1987 with mtv europe and mtv australia , is part of a growing trend among cable channel owners , many of whom think the american market has grown about as much as it can the international area is a very big growth area for cable , said steven rosenberg , the senior vice president of hbo international everybody is looking at it us market is 'maturing' j patrick michaels jr , the chairman of communications equity associates , a brokerage firm that specializes in media investments , said if you look at the list of who is now investing overseas , you see 10 of the top 12 cable companies cable is a maturing industry in the united states facing diminishing returns herbert granath , the president of capital cities abc video enterprises , was an early advocate of expansion abroad capital cities invested in a cable channel in germany and , with the french channel canal plus , in tesn , an allsports channel similar to abc s espn last month , mr granath engineered a merger of tesn and eurosport , the continent s largest sports channel , creating the same dominance of sports television in europe that espn wields in the united states for a while we were pretty much alone in this business , except for cnn , mr granath said of the overseas moves now all the old friends are starting to show up tci , viacom , the family channel telecommunications inc , the largest cable operator in the united states , owns , among numerous other holdings , the discovery channel , which has established a european version of its programming viacom owns mtv as well as nickelodeon , the american channel devoted to children s programs nickelodeon last month announced a joint venture with rupert murdoch s british sky broadcasting for a 12houraday channel of children s programming the family channel is exploring markets in eastern europe , including romania hbo is another prominent cable channel with a thriving international division the paytelevision channel began a latin american subsidiary called hbo ole in 1991 , and has interests in paytelevision channels in hungary , scandinavia , singapore and new zealand cable television , as american viewers know it , is seldom precisely duplicated in international television markets cable systems have been well established in some countries the netherlands , for example , has five million cable homes , 80 percent of the country s households with television but more often , cable s reach is limited britain has only 480 , 000 cable homes just 2 percent of televisionowning households in such countries , american cable programming is transmitted through other means , either on satellite dishes or over the air through what is known as a multichannel , multipoint distribution service some of the major cable operators , including telecommunications , are also investing in cable systems in overseas markets cnn , of course , is the most international of all cable channels it reaches more than 140 countries but sara levinson , the executive vice president of mtv , said that cnn had a unique approach cnn is essentially a us service provided in english for broadcast around the world , she said what we have done is customize the mtv service for each market we have definitely blazed that path mtv s customized marketing mtv has customized its channel by using for the most part the local language and using local performers as video jockeys in brazil , for example , many locally produced music videos are used and the channel expects its latin american version will eventually include many videos produced in central and south america hbo , too , has customized its movieoriented programming to individual markets by dubbing films into local language but mr rosenberg argued that not all american cable programming is exportable howto shows and situation comedies , for example , might not travel well movies , sports , news and music that s it , he said those are the franchises you build a franchise and look to expand that franchise hbo has sought local partnerships for its international versions the international versions of mtv each have been set up according to the ownership regulations in each country , mr levinson said where it can , mtv owns the channel outright , as it does in europe and several latin america countries where a nation s restrictions prevent that , it finds a partner and licenses the mtv name , as it has done in japan and brazil 'there s no time to do a study' mr granath said the cable companies looking to overseas markets are taking the kind of bold action that other american companies have failed to take in recent years ibm and sears now say things happened while they were studying what to do , he said in the television markets in europe and the pacific rim , there s no time to do a study none of the cable executives would disclose how much money they have invested in their international operations but mr granath said we 're spending an enormous amount of time , energy and money it s not for the faint of heart the europeans tend to think these investments should turn a profit after one year but there s going to be a lot of money lost on these deals it s a three to fiveyear investment curve nor would any of the cable executives predict that revenues from international operations might ever rival revenues attained in the united states there s never going to be another us market , with 90 million tv households , mr rosenberg said the rate of growth internationally is dramatic , but not the dollar growth mr granath added , i think it will always be thought of as ancillary business that assessment could change if the full potential of the international television market could ever be tapped mr granath said that in the european community alone there are more television households than in the us and there is a long history of advertisers spending most of their money in print he added , speaking of europe we 're not forecasting that this will ever be a huge business , but it could surprise me
i remember standing in front of a painting of two spanish children in oldfashioned costumes they are in front of a background of flowers in a field that has a rousseaulike primitive quality about it , but also something else , more subtle and haunting although the colors in the flesh of the children are distinctly painted , i have the eerie impression that they have faded , even as the time of childhood and of that particular past seems to fade right before my eyes i do not know why i am so moved by this particular painting i move on and i find myself before another similar , very large canvas , only now it is a man and a woman who are grown still that quality of a very old photograph persists and then there are dancers who kick up their legs in stylized , stopped joy , again both ecstatic and static , but static with a stasis that is meant to preserve and george washington upon his stopped horse as i wander among the marble benches of this east hampton gallery , house of objects , i am not sure what is being done to my imagination , my mind i am definitely in some part of the past that is deeply familiar , and yes even familial , a past that tempts the assignment of meaning , of narrative story , as it were , even as it simultaneously defies it and then i think of the artist , francisco sainz , whom many know primarily as a maker of spirited masks , or brightly colored , often objectshaped paintings through this show of paintings of the 60 s , a past looking back on its own past , is he wearing a new mask \? it was a strange and rather moving decision on the part of morgan rank to show this segment of sainz s work at a moment in which his recent work , decidedly more playful and less nostalgic , is rapidly coming into its own , having been featured in shows by renee fotouhi and the odeon gallery of sag harbor during the last two years in a corner , francisco sainz \( or paco as he is more often affectionately known \) is standing , he who , like one of his masked faces , can be turned in two ways , so that what is hidden and inside conveys a wholly different color and mood scheme from the outside , so that even the particular creatureness of the being portrayed is often altered unrecognizably , horns growing out of a forehead which in its reversal has no horns , large eyes where before there were only the most rudimentary paint dots or holes his rosy santa clausstyle face is familiar to many , as is his white hair , which a christmas ago he decked in garlands playing in a pageant at odd fellows playhouse in east hampton , a combination of a golden bough sort of rendition of old father time , and a somewhat saddened spanish poet reclaiming his roots he turns up at odd moments , whether in paintstained pants sneaking into a posh library benefit , for the sheer pleasure , i think , of being slightly naughty , but also for peoplewatching , one of his favorite occupations the next moment rather modestly coming into his own as a developing writer , reading aloud from his evolving memoir revealing his spanish civil war coming of age , which in places reads almost like a poem he was born in 1923 in santander , not far from the prehistoric altamira cave paintings , the child of a school teacher and a miner but soon the family was forced to move to burgos , a city whose brothels and gloomy cathedrals made a lasting impression on the boy as he wandered the streets , tried to learn about death by visiting the morgue near his home he found ways to be driven to places that would have been out of his reach by offering , for pennies , to show tourists the sights presence of an adventurer from the onset of the memoir we feel we are in the presence of an adventurer , whether the child is learning to be a bullfighter , taught by an older failed dreamer , or experimenting with his father s wineskin in the shape and the actual body of an entire pig but already the rumblings of the spanish civil war have begun the struggle that was to have a profound influence on his life and work his involvement with the underground began very early , as he joined other young people in their work against the dictatorship , holding many odd jobs and wearing many disguises , even becoming , for a time , the professional bullfighter he dreamed he would be when he was discovered he fled to portugal , hoping eventually to join other spaniards fighting with the british eighth army in north africa arrested in lisbon , he was taken to the infamous caxias prison , held there for a while and then put on a train bound for spain , where he was to be delivered over to the fascists but before reaching the spanish city of badajoz , he jumped out of the speeding train and was able to elude both the portuguese and spanish police he went underground again and surfaced with a new name and identity in barcelona , where no one knew him it was during this period that he got interested in painting , becoming an apprentice to francisco sainz de la maza , a fashionable academic painter , brother of the great guitarist and composer regino sainz de la maza
the third attempted launching of the roundtheworld earthwinds hilton balloon in two years was canceled yesterday , this time because of an accident that could have had serious consequences for two men aboard the craft an earthwinds spokesman said the men were not injured , but several vital components of the complicated balloon assembly were damaged project officials could not immediately estimate how long it would take to rebuild the system , assuming that its sponsors decided to try again to get the 5 million craft into the air although a handful of balloonists have tried over the years to circumnavigate the earth , none has ever succeeded , and some have died trying the accident yesterday happened as the upper balloon of the twoballoon earthwinds was being filled with helium at its pad at reno stead airfield in nevada without warning , the upper balloon , which is 140 feet in diameter , tore loose from its mooring , yanking the crew capsule 20 feet into the air inspection crew endangered the balloon s ascent was checked by cables connecting the crew capsule to the craft s anchor balloon , filled with compressed air to be used as ballast but there were fears that the mooring system would give way completely , allowing the craft to go aloft with an inadequate supply of helium and two men who were aboard inspecting the balloon the two were making final inspections and adjustments before the regular crew went aboard one man trapped in the dangling crew capsule , tim lachenmeier of raven industries inc in sioux falls , sd , is the chief designer and builder of earthwinds he immediately recognized the danger that he and dave melton , an alternate flight crew member , faced as the giant balloon tugged against its remaining tether they quickly activated a safety mechanism that ripped the helium balloon apart , spilling its load of helium and dropping the capsule to the ground various instruments and mechanical components outside the capsule were badly damaged , and both the helium balloon and the heavy anchor balloon , which together cost roughly 250 , 000 , were destroyed richard abruzzo , who was to have been one of the three crew members , had arrived at the pad about 5 am in preparation for the launching , a few minutes before the accident the other crew members were to be the captain of the flight , larry newman , and maj gen vladimir a dzhanibekov of the russian air force the helium loading was going smoothly , mr abruzzo said in an interview we just do n't know yet what happened , whether the mooring bolts broke , or pulled loose from the concrete tarmac , or what the first attempted launching from akron , ohio , in 1992 , was canceled when high winds forced the crew to destroy the gossamerthin plastic helium balloon a second attempt , from reno last january , ended when the overweight balloon grazed a mountain ridge five miles from the launching pad , and crashed photo the earthwinds hilton balloon is prepared for launching at the reno stead airfield in nevada moments before an accident aborted the flight \( associated press \)
you do n't listen , a sometimes catatonic girl reiterates , with varying degrees of resignation and anger , in one of the two singleact plays that make up the second offering of the signature theater company s season , which is devoted to the works of edward albee it is an accusation that mr albee himself might address to the new york audiences who have largely abandoned him in recent years when listening and counting the ways were first presented in the states , at the hartford theater company in 1977 \( they are only now receiving their new york premiere \) , fashionable theatergoers were growing tired of dutifully furrowing their brows over mr albee s increasingly opaque plays and by the mid1980 s , after several broadway disasters , mr albee s work had been largely consigned , in this country at least , to academia now the signature theater , with its program of mostly lesserknown albee works , is making the case that mr albee remains very much worth listening to and although there may be people for whom the playwright s vintage absurdism now seems close to camp , the signature theater is unquestionably right while much of broadway theater oozes with a formulaic glibness just this side of standardissue television , mr albee s continuing suspicion of all forms of communication offers a bracing counterpoint the ways in which he conveys this , particularly in works as abstract as those now being performed at signature , can still seem annoyingly murky and singleminded but the very fierceness of mr albee s struggle remains compelling and oddly touching it mirrors , in fact , his characters' bewildered , verbally selfsabotaging wrestling matches with the fallibility of words and memory both counting the ways and listening are essentially linguistic chamber works \( listening was initially produced as a radio play in england \) though they are radically different in tone , their preoccupation with the slipperiness of language and perception and with the opacity of what truly lies behind it is much the same the questions posed reverberate without answers and are often as unapologetically naked as who am i \? who are you \? and do you love me \? the last forms the basis of counting the ways , a twocharacter series of vignettes that suggests a r gurney s love letters set in an empirical limbo directed by albee himself , the play is surprisingly lighthearted , almost selfparodying , with a selfconscious , selfinterrupting structure that effectively invites the audience to join the game with chipper befuddlement , the husband and the wife \( everyone , of course , has only generic names \) , genially played by baxter harris and patricia kilgarriff , anatomize their relationship , or try to much of this takes the form of deadend rounds of antics with semantics , which include plucking the petals of a rose \( and then reassembling it \) to the refrain of she loves me , she loves me not \( and its inversion me loves he , not me loves he \) and pondering , with comic earnestness , the real meaning of the movie title love in the afternoon none of this is very helpful , of course , for the spouses , who at one point discover their double bed has divided into single ones and who are largely isolated from each other in droll , selfcontained monologues about loss , grief , dances and dinner parties in which social triviality and mortality disconcertingly rub elbows the play s actual dialogue by no means represents communication \( her best effort is to rush in and chirp at her husband , in a rush of words , walnut , parsley , bone marrow , celery root , creme brulee \) but the playwright and his characters seem rather cheerfully accepting of this state of things the performance is perhaps a little too cute , but to see mr albee being blithe is , well , kind of heartening , and the presentation is not without charm listening , directed by paul weidner , takes up the same concerns in a more somber and sinister key inattentiveness and misunderstanding here can slice like a razor , though the issue of individual intention remains doggedly ambiguous set in a park where an empty fountain and a carpet of dead leaves exude a sense of the moribund , the play brings together three characters with , of course , uncertain identity the man \( joe ponazecki \) may or may not be a cook and may or may not have been the lover of the woman \( jacqueline brookes \) , who has arrived with a feral , psychologically crippled girl \( francie swift \) for whom she seems to be a sort of therapist and caretaker there is also an anonymous voice that intermittently interrupts the action to call out numbers , perhaps to remind us that we should distrust even the play itself ambiguity multiplies as each character retreats to vivid accounts of shifting memories of events that may or may not have happened and that may have the power to wound if overheard the girl , who must ultimately become yet another of mr albee s christlike victims , periodically emerges from catatonia to tell the woman , you do n't listen well , answers the woman wearily , that may be does she or does n't she \? mr albee lets the point ride all of this will be familiar to those who know mr albee s work , and he has made similar points more beguilingly before but though listening tests its listeners' concentration , the play is an often searing exercise in frustration , as the characters present , dissect and dismiss chains of words that , however lyric and evocative they may be , are ultimately as disabled as the girl herself it is ms brookes , in a centered , rivetingly taut performance , who holds the play together like mr albee himself , her character seems to exist in a perpetual state of testy philosophical exasperation this is probably also the way you 'll feel when you leave the theater but that may be a healthy thing photo jacqueline brookes , left , and francie swift in the signature theater company s production of listening \( susan johann listening \)
croton falls in the last scene of lanford wilson s burn this , two opposite people make a commitment it is a wildly romantic notion , a dreamy resolution to a story of disconnection , deception and freefloating panic only a pushover for fairy tale endings could have written this one and only a lyric playwright of mr wilson s artistry could make it work but it s only a scene the play that leads up to it is the improbable thing mr wilson has a proven flair for creating hope and illumination amid dross but this time , he appears to present an outsider s view of a world that eludes him failing to invent wholly drawn characters to inhabit that inauthentic world , mr wilson lets his play depend on commanding performances and surpassing direction obviously , a misguided choice for a modest company like wordplay ii , whose actors do n't have the showiness to deal with their exceedingly tiresome roles or the power to transcend the flaws of the play the lovers , who had sex just hours after meeting , are anna , a modern dancer turned choreographer , and pale , a maitre d' and a very wild man the play s other two characters are burton , a screenwriter in love with anna , and larry , a gay stereotype who works in advertising anna may well be the play s most incomplete character ever at the effect of a society in chaos , she is further weakened by the playwright s shallow vision of a contemporary creative woman in distress that the role can be filled in with an actress s wit and presence was proved conclusively by joan allen , who won the 1988 tony award for best leading actress in a play in the beginning , robin gorn as anna whines about the death of her roommate near the end , she whines about the perils of life in the city and that appears to take in the vocal and emotional range of her performance anna serves as a cipher to pale , the eruptive character , a contemporary urban stanley kowalski who is , believe it , tamed by art in the first place , pale was a showcase for the excesses of john malkovich in the second , for his replacement , eric roberts to talk of robert p king s underplaying as an attempt to find a new dimension for pale is to be gratuitously indulgent to not talk of it at all is more sensible charlie banks seems overcome by larry , a smug , annoying character who subsists on wisecracks , when he is n't relegated to the sidelines as the resident eavesdropper or voyeur as if in redemption , charlie winds up as a benevolent matchmaker best is steve jones \( burton \) , who can get by with a straightforward account of an undemanding role against frank norwood watson s peculiar setting , an outofsync view from the window of a misconceived loft , cara caldwellwatson s rhythmless staging makes a long , tedious play seem sadly longer and more tedious than it has a right to be the absence of a scenebyscene synopsis in the program does not let audiences in on the time span of a play that is meant to encompass three and a half months not an eternity while the playwright gets in a few tirades about the mindlessness of movies , the concealment of homosexuality none have real sting , though , given his title , one should say , fire besides , much of mr wilson s material , lacking perspective , sounds dated and hollow almost six years after the broadway premiere of burn this his images of incendiarism are consistently forced , from references to burnout and burning up , to pale s normal temperature , about 110 degrees the true significance of the title , which means a writer s defensive inclination after setting down an intensely private impulse , presumably remains private for the playwright with all that , the last scene glows burn this by lanford wilson presented by wordplay ii at the schoolhouse , owens road in croton falls remaining performances today and next sunday at 4 pm friday and saturday at 8 pm box office 2778477
basement leaks occur most often in the spring , when melting snow , thawing ground and frequent rains saturate the soil and raise water tables taking precautions can prevent leaks and sometimes even stop those in progress the most important steps are making sure that gutters and downspouts work without leaking or overflowing and that splash blocks or drain hoses direct water from the gutters at least six feet away from the foundation keep window wells free of leaves and other debris that can block drains or cover gravel at their bases installing bubbleshape plastic covers over the wells provides further protection avoid heaping shoveled snow against the foundation or in places where meltwater may flow toward the building also , caulk seams where foundation masonry meets other building components like window and door frames and where a foundation meets a sidewalk , concrete patio or other poorly drained surface water flowing through holes or cracks in a foundation can be repaired with hydraulic cement , a powdered cement that can harden despite the presence of excess water and water pressure to apply such cement , widen and undercut the sides of the damaged area with a hammer and cold chisel , so that the opening is wider inside the masonry than at the surface that is important , because the cement expands as it hardens , and the sloping sides of the opening help lock the cement in place use a ball peen hammer or small sledge instead of a carpenter s hammer , as the carpenter s hammer can splinter when struck against the chisel , and wear safety goggles after chiseling , scrub loose material from the area with a wire brush then mix the cement powder in a container with clean water to the consistency of soft modeling clay to fill a hole , don rubber gloves , as cement is mildly caustic , and form a ball of cement into a cone two to four inches long whose base is about an inch wider than the hole hold the cone until it begins to feel warm , a sign of hardening that usually takes about three minutes force the cone , point first , into the hole and press it for three to five minutes , until the cement hardens the surface can be smoothed with a putty knife before hardening is complete to fill cracks , wait for the cement to warm in the container and apply it with a mason s trowel or putty knife press the tool or scrape it repeatedly against the cement until hardening fill deep cracks and holes only to within a halfinch of the surface press against the cement with a stick or gloved finger if there is no room for a putty knife when the cement hardens , add a second layer an independent building inspector , structural engineer or concrete specialist should analyze leaks that return despite patching the repairs include unblocking the footing drains , surrounding the base of the foundation underground and storm drains landscaping can improve drainage , and excavating can be done to accomplish repairs and install footing drains or drainage materials where none exist excavating and installing drainage materials always have to be outside a foundation , but footing drains can sometimes be installed from inside by breaking through the edge of the basement floor with a jackhammer because less digging is required than with exterior excavation , interior excavation can be up to 60 percent cheaper after eliminating the causes of returning leaks , the cracked or damaged concrete may be suitable for repair by injecting epoxy or polyurethane foam kits often contain the materials and tools for such repairs but because the materials cannot be removed by practical means repairs are often best carried out by professionals for information about repairing concrete with epoxy and polyurethane , write to or call the international concrete

engineers and product manufacturers dampness on basement walls , in contrast to individual leaks , can sometimes be eliminated by applying cementitous waterproofing paint drylok masonry waterproofer , manufactured by united gilsonite laboratories of scranton , pa , is one brand success with such paint depends on first cleaning the wall thoroughly instructions for preparing walls come with the paint before buying waterproofing paint , make sure that the dampness is not indoor condensation , which can be eliminated by increasing ventilation or reducing sources of indoor moisture tape one or more 12inch squares of aluminum foil to the wall or walls with heavy utility tape , sealing the edges of the foil after about five days , remove the foil if the side of the foil touching the walls is dry , indoor condensation is the cause , and waterproofing paint will do nothing to eliminate the problem if the side of the foil next to the wall is wet , the cause is most likely moisture seeping through the foundation , which can be cured by painting diagrams use chalked string to mark layout lines separating sheetmounted and individual field tiles from trim tiles align tiles by using the side of a trowel after filling seams with grout , remove excess by scraping tiles diagonally with grout float \( edward lipinski \)
san diego , may 3 the computations remain very viable for the mets an eightandahalfgame deficit in may is n't statistical death but for all the optimistic equations the mets can draw up , they have no option every night but to write the names murray , bonilla and johnson into the lineup card s no 3 , 4 and 5 spots the names and their numbers have n't added up to much for the mets in 1992 , and so far in 1993 are they a hopelessly inadequate fit \? there is plenty of reason to suspect so , and there is doubt about whether the mets can ever generate the kind of offense needed to establish themselves as a contender this season for this club to be successful , we 're going to have to be a much better offensive club , said general manager al harazin we absolutely have to score runs at a much greater pace gwynn outhits all three the analysis was painfully obvious after the events of the last week first the giants and then the padres put on clinics of run production against the mets , who mounted no sustained response tony gwynn s 11 hits in the threegame weekend series in san diego surpassed the total fivegame roadtrip production of eddie murray , bobby bonilla and howard johnson despite a determination to prove 1992 a fluke , murray , bonilla and johnson have again looked like a terribly flawed heart of the order murray , after a torrid start , has gone stone cold , with one hit in his last 19 times at bat bonilla , the cleanup man who by his own admission lacks the homerun menace others who fill that role possess , had to get hot sunday to get his average to an anemic 235 johnson , who appears sounder at the plate than he did last year , still has only five extrabase hits , and his average stands at 218 the group has hit a combined 246 is it merely a slow start \? or is it an inherent weakness in the lineup s construction \? none of the three seem capable of hitting for average , and in a telling statistic , there have been only nine times all season in which the three have produced more than one hit in an inning only once have the three amassed three straight hits the central problem is clear the mets lack a classic no 3 man that slot usually demands someone who can hit for average as well as extra bases the giants have will clark in the spot , the padres place gary sheffield there , and the phillies boast john kruk \( 342 , 5 homers , 16 rbi \) the mets thought bonilla was the right fit but changed before the start of the season to murray but the first baseman lacks speed , is on a pace to strike out 100 times and has given no real reason to believe he 'll hit much higher than the 260 average he has registered in each of the last two seasons the club has begun to at least informally consider trying johnson in the no 3 hole if his stroke continues to improve you hit 229 as a club , and it s tough to be too innovative , or on the flip side , to ever get too set , said barry foote , the firstbase coach and one of manager jeff torborg s top theoreticians it s obvious the inherent problem we have , but we are limited in what we can do the answer is for all of them to hit better it s hard to envision a scenario in which the mets could hit worse bonilla , who hit 31 points below his career average in 1992 , is stuck at the moment nearly 50 points below it the right fielder , too , demonstrated a tendency last year to pile up runs batted in in blowouts or lost causes and to go for significant stretches where he hardly drove in any runs at all he could easily get his 90 rbi and 20 homers and have them not account for much johnson has dismissed april as a typical stagger at the start and has produced an encouraging assortment of singles lately but he clearly is not feared the way he once was as a man who can grab a game by the throat the heart of the order s ability to be a force has been undermined , as well , by the deadening effect of the final third of the order \( jeff kent 206 , ryan thompson 125 \) and the lack of dynamism at the top the leadoff man , vince coleman , went into sunday s game with a 284 onbase percentage and no 2 man tony fernandez has hit 197 there could be some constructive changes coming , with joe orsulak and dave gallagher taking over for thompson , who is now back in the minors , and fernandez s various ailments getting better will it be enough \? can they help what looks like an illconceived , underachieving lineup \? we do have the problem of the club with the best record in baseball being in our division , said harazin , referring to the phillies that sounds alarm bells photo mets' tony fernandez throwing to first as san diego s jeff gardner breaks up a double play on ball hit by kurt stillwell on sunday \( associated press \)
in an advance along the demanding road to development of an aids vaccine , researchers have shown that a vaccine derived from an aidslike monkey virus can prevent vaginal infection in the animals , as might occur in human heterosexual sex while experimental vaccines had previously been shown to give protection to monkeys , none had worked for heterosexual transmission experts praised the new study , which is being published today in the journal science but they warned that it would take years of more research to develop a human aids vaccine , if one can be devised what makes this important is that it addresses the primary mode of hiv transmission , said dr shiulok hu , a virologist at the university of washington and at bristolmyers squibb in seattle although hiv , the virus that causes human aids , is commonly transmitted in the united states and europe through homosexual contact and through intravenous drug use , heterosexual transmission is the most common way it is spread in other parts of the world , especially africa and asia in the new study , scientists from new mexico , alabama and georgia used new technology and strategy to immunize monkeys against the simian immunodeficiency virus , the aidslike virus in monkeys they found that a vaccine consisting of chemically killed virus , followed by a booster , prevented transmission of the virus when it was introduced into the animals' vaginas other experimental vaccines have protected animals against this monkey aids virus , and against hiv in humans , when these viruses were injected into the veins of the immunized animals such experiments offer valuable evidence for protection of intravenous drug users previously just theory but because scientists know that antibodies and other factors that are produced in different areas of the body are important in immunological defenses , the evidence from previous intravenous experiments offers only theoretical reasons for believing that such vaccines would protect against heterosexual transmission in the new study , five of six monkeys were protected against vaginal transmission when the doses of chemically killed simian virus were injected into the muscles and then a booster was given orally or in the lungs oral immunization alone did not protect them the booster vaccine was made by using a new microsphere technique developing microscopicsize beads less than a thousandth of an inch in diameter that contain a highly diluted , inactive form of simian virus the beads are designed to allow slow release of the vaccine dr preston a marx of the new mexico regional primate laboratory , the senior author of the study , and experts elsewhere expressed cautious optimism about the feasibility of developing a human aids vaccine dr dani bolognesi , an aids vaccine expert at duke university , said that dr marx s team had come up with a novel approach dr marx , dr hu , dr bolognesi and dr murray gardner of the university of california at davis all said there was reason to believe that a similar vaccine could be developed to protect men however , such experiments have yet to be carried out dr marx said he began the experiments in july 1990 at the california primate center in davis by giving the first of a series of injections of simianvirus vaccine he took the monkeys with him to the primate center that he now heads at hollomon air force base in new mexico at first the experiments seemed headed for a dead end , but one of his collaborators , dr john h eldridge at the university of alabama in birmingham , came across a new method that led to success , dr marx said a year after injections of the simian vaccine , none of the monkeys had developed high levels of antibodies in the vagina so dr marx said he tried the new approach dr eldridge had learned from other experiments that when microspheres were introduced into the lungs , this significantly augmented the vaginal immune system the researchers tested the encapsulated simian vaccine on 14 monkeys , divided into four groups as a scientific control , the scientists applied the vaccine to four nonvaccinated animals three became infected after one application to the vagina the fourth become infected after a second application a second group of four monkeys was given five doses of the microencapsulated simian vaccine in the stomach only small traces of antibodies were detected in blood , and no sign of immunity was found in the vagina all four became infected within two weeks after a single application to the vagina the two other groups received boosters of encapsulated siv in january 1992 , about a year after receiving the last of three injections of the vaccine in thigh muscles one group , which was given boosters in the lungs , showed the strongest immunity in blood and vaginal fluids two of three animals were protected from vaginal transmission the three monkeys in the last group were given booster doses in the stomach , and all three animals resisted two vaginal exposures to the virus limited group of animals the experiments were limited to a small number of animals because of the high costs and a desire to use the smallest number of monkeys tests of experimental vaccines are intended to give live virus to immunized animals at a time when the scientists believe this might achieve the best results in the new mexico experiments , dr marx said his team applied simian virus to the vaginas of the immunized animals at times of peak immunity , two weeks after the last booster doses the researchers used a complex test known as polymerase chain reaction to show that the immunized monkeys challenged with the virus have remained free of infection for more than a year and a half after the challenge dr marx said he had failed in previous efforts with a different vaccine to protect against vaginal challenge with the siminan virus and that others had failed with still other vaccines he said he did not know the immunological mechanism that allowed the encapsulated vaccine to work and that his team has found no satisfactory explanation for the failure in one monkey dr marx said his team did not test rectal immunity because the study was intended to explore the feasibility of a vaccine against heterosexual transmission an earlier study of animals in britain has shown that another vaccine has given partial protection against rectal transmission dr marx and others said that the success of the new mexico study leaves a number of questions that need to be answered in future tests , such as how long does immunity last \? if it is not lifelong , how many boosters will be needed \? will the vaccine protect if the virus is given weeks or months after peak immunity \? will such a vaccine protect against strains of virus that are different from the ones used to make the vaccine \? can a recombinant vaccine be made from a fragment of hiv \? if so , which component is the critical fragment \? dr gardner , the expert from the university of california at davis , said the new study is meaningful , promising , and points us in a new direction that we will have to follow until we understand how the vaccine works or we come to a dead end in this line of work , any step forward is welcome
san francisco , may 28 the jury trial scheduled for june 28 in the longrunning copyright infringement suit by apple computer inc against the microsoft corporation and the hewlettpackard company has been removed from the court calendar with the approval of the three companies a pretrial hearing scheduled for tuesday by federal district judge vaughn walker will still take place , and the case could still proceed to an appeal after the judge s has ruled we 're confident that we could have prevailed in a jury trial , said andrew ould , a hewlettpackard spokesman the courts are overcrowded these days this is the reasonable thing to do because the parties wo n't tie up the court s time with a trial the agreement comes after judge walker essentially narrowed the case to one issue whether microsoft s windows program s appearance is virtually identical to that of the apple lisa , a predecessor to the macintosh microsoft filed a motion monday saying this was not the case hewlettpackard filed a similar motion regarding its new wave program , which runs with windows , and apple filed a motion of nonopposition to those motions last week , judge walker further narrowed the scope of the fiveyearold apple suit against microsoft and hewlettpackard his ruling meant that a jury would consider only 4 of the 147 software features that apple originally contended had been copied by hewlettpackard , and none of the 189 specific microsoft features that apple had originally challenged
st charles , mo , july 15 living as she does at the confluence of the missouri and the mississippi , yvonne kinnard has always kept a wary eye on the two rivers , knowing , assuming , that periodically they will break free of their banks and levees and come licking at her front door seven times in the last 20 years they have rampaged across their flood plains , including the great watery disaster of 1973 , when they combined forces and crept into her threebedroom ranch house in west alton , ruining the rugs and some appliances but she never expected anything like the assault last friday that sent a threefoot wall of water crashing through the front door , forcing her family to retreat without so much as a change of clothes so thursday morning mrs kinnard found herself , along with a hundredequally stunned flood victims , standing in line at a federal disaster center hastily set up in a school hall in this suburb on the western edge of st louis i need help , she told an aid worker , a hint of embarrassment in her plea a lot of help is available for the victims of what may turn out to be the worst flood in american history cash grants , lowcost rebuilding loans , tax relief , temporary housing , food stamps , crisis counseling all over the region , aid centers like the one here are opening as the federal government begins to respond to the flooding when it comes to disasters , particularly floods , the government is both generous and forgiving disaster officials say it would be cruel and inhumane to be otherwise but some critics of the nation s flood control policies , including a growing number of lawmakers on capitol hill , contend that the programs are too generous and forgiving they say the aid often ends up encouraging people to remain in floodprone areas and not take adequate precautions in fact , president clinton warned today in washington that the federal government could not be responsible for all the losses incurred in this year s disaster , which by his administration s own estimates has swelled to 8 billion page b6 whatever the case , to hear flood victims like yvonne kinnard talk , it is evident that for many there is something seductive about rivers and living near them it is a seduction that disarms that second sense in otherwise reasonable people that is supposed to sniff unacceptable risk and warn that there is really nothing to keep the next flood from being the worst of all you just ca n't believe how nice and pretty it is living down there in west alton , mrs kinnard said as she worked her way down the disaster center processing line , starting with the registrar , maria kimes ms kimes , a disaster worker who , like most of the workers in the st charles center , normally is based in boston , nodded and smiled i certainly never thought in all my days i 'd end up here , said mrs kinnard , who is 45 we got aid back in '73 but everybody said after that , 'no way it 'll ever be that bad again' now there s water three feet deep in my house , a foot above a mark i made on the wall after '73 , and i have to take a fourmile boat ride through the fields to get to the place every single thing is ruined ms kimes made a check on the form where it referred to access to damaged property how big is your family \? she asked me , my husband , jimmy , and my two boys , andy and dale , mrs kinnard replied do you have any clothing \? i borrowed some do you have shelter \? i 've rented a house over in illinois from a friend so you 're getting by \? yes i guess but i'm worried that we wo n't have enough money for all the repairs ms kimes reviewed mrs kinnard s form and then sent her to talk with the next official down the line , jerry mccrea , a loan officer for the small business administration if you qualify , mr mccrea told her , we can loan you up to 100 , 000 for repairs for as little as 4 percent interest and if you 'd like , we can increase the loan by 20 percent so that you can make improvements on your house that will help protect it from future flood damage you could maybe build a high room where you could store vulnerable things like appliances mrs kinnard said she did n't know how much damage had been done and probably would n't know until the waters receded she noted that , unlike a lot of people who live in floodprone areas , she and her husband have federal flood insurance their house is valued at 75 , 000 , she said , and the insurance premiums are about 350 a year would that cover the damage and any rebuilding and improvements \? mr mccrea replied that only her insurance agent could answer that question , and that she should contact him as soon as she could in the interim , he said , it might be possible to get a repair loan from the smallbusiness agency , and the loan could then be repaid by the insurance payment if you can get them , we need to see your tax returns , your deed , all papers like that , he continued here are some more forms to fill out just make estimates , if you have to we understand get them back to us , and we 'll get right back to you mrs kinnard , already carrying an armful of forms , reached for the batch proffered by mr mccrea and shook her head slowly i do n't know , just do n't know , she murmured mr mccrea reached out and touched her arm it s going to work out , he said i promise mrs kinnard s next stop was at a desk labled hazard mitigation welcome ! said the mitigation official , grace walker i 've got something serious i want to talk to you about mrs kinnard sat down , and ms walker launched into an enthusiastic pitch , one that many flood experts say is the ultimate answer to flood disasters
government needs to promote greater diversity in the financing and delivery of health services regulation can strengthen private insurance markets by improving incentives for wide coverage and cost control spending on health should be redirected to more costeffective programs that do more to help the poor the message sounds familiar the medium , however , is not hillary rodham clinton but the world bank s latest world development report , published this week and the subject is not the 800 billion lavished on the care of 250 million americans , but the frugal 170 billion worth of services doled out to the 41 billion citizens of the globe s low and middleincome countries the world bank s focus is necessarily on who gets access to penicillin and clean drinking water rather than who is eligible for the fruits of modern medical technology like mri scans and bone marrow transplants yet the core economic problems in rationing health services efficiently without much help from free markets \( or moral philosophers \) seem remarkably similar while very little is spent on health in the poorest twothirds of the world , the report suggests that a little goes a long way child mortality has plummeted and life expectancy risen sharply over the last two decades , even in places that are testing humans' lower limits of subsistence this is modest comfort , however the probability of a child dying before the age of 5 is still 30 times higher in mozambique than in singapore by the world bank s broadest measure of health the portion of the average life lost to disabling illness or premature death the rich industrial economies are five times healthier than subsaharan africa and three times healthier than india economic growth and education remain the fixes of choice , the main chance for people who are weakened by malnutrition and lacking knowledge of the rules of survival in a world seething with disease but the bank s economists also point to the failure of poor countries to squeeze the biggest possible bang from a buck spent on health for example , basic treatment of leukemia typically adds just onetenth of a year to an adult s life at a cost of about 5 , 000 shifting the 5 , 000 to the provision of vitamin a supplements for children could generate 10 , 000 additional years of healthy life or it could mean an extra 1 , 500 to 5 , 000 years of life if invested in measles immunization by the same token , the payoff from relatively cheap improvements in the environment could be awesome keeping human and animal waste out of drinking water would reduce the total burden of disease in poor countries by 10 percent more surprising , eliminating the smoke inside dwellings from cooking and heating could cut childhood pneumonia by half and reduce the burden of disease by 5 percent the world bank staff estimates that a barebones package of public health services plus clinical care might cost as little as 12 a person in the neediest countries , yet reduce the burden of disease by 25 percent total cost an extra 15 billion a year , a barely noticeable sum in a global economy with purchasing power that exceeds 20 trillion all this may seem frustrating , like one of those public service ads that promise to transform your pocket change into enough powdered milk to nourish a thousand starving infants for a year if lifesaving is so cheap , what are governments doing with the billions from charity and foreign aid \? an easy answer is that a good chunk of the money sent to poor countries is spent on toys for the ruling classes , weapons in particular the answer emphasized in the world bank report , one that links the healthcare problems of the richest countries to the poorest , is that it is very hard to deliver any service efficiently without a lot of help from free markets third parties that only incidentally benefit from costeffective outcomes insurance companies , governments , health delivery bureaucrats are not likely to make the right decisions for example , poor countries generally spend far too much of their healthcare budgets on urban hospitals that offer sophisticated services to a tiny fraction of the population by no coincidence , much of the subsidies for medical care go to middle and upperincome families who have the least moral claim to public resources a part of the solution , the world bank report argues , is to decentralize delivery and force deliverers to compete on cost and health outcomes in a phrase , to manage competition but just as there is no panacea for healthcare reform in america , there is none for the third world someone has to make basic choices about who gets what quality of medical care , and that someone is probably government efficient healthcare systems , it seems , may not be able to live with big government but as a practical matter , they probably cannot live without it drawing

moscow , sept 22 president boris n yeltsin received crucial pledges of support today from leaders of russia s military and police forces , while opposition members of parliament issued a stream of defiant resolutions against them there was no change in the basic situation since the startling developments of tuesday , when mr yeltsin ordered the disbanding of the supreme soviet , or parliament , which includes many communists and nationalists opposed to mr yeltsin s policies in response , the parliamentary leaders selected vice president aleksandr v rutskoi , who long ago broke with mr yeltsin , as acting president this created a country with two presidents , both seeking public support there were no signs of an imminent solution to the standstill demonstrating their confidence in mr yeltsin , the ministers of defense and the interior , gen pavel s grachev and viktor f yerin , joined mr yeltsin in a breezy stroll in pushkin square , each declaring that his forces were squarely behind the government television also showed the two ministers and the new minister of security , nikolai m golushko , bantering casually with mr yeltsin earlier mr golushko held a separate news conference to pledge the support of his ministry , the successor to the kgb these ministers command most of russia s farflung security forces , and their public demonstrations of fealty answered a major question hanging over the showdown triggered by mr yeltsin s announcement tuesday that he was dissolving parliament to break the political deadlock that has paralyzed russian reforms a possible prearrangement the show of support suggested that mr yeltsin had prepared the ground by lining up the backing of the defense and police leaders the yeltsin government also controlled the television reporting of the crisis , which did not ignore the opposition but gave overwhelmingly positive coverage to mr yeltsin for the moment , the members of the supreme soviet , the standing parliament that over the past two years has evolved into an archenemy of mr yeltsin s government and policies , remained clustered in their headquarters , known as the white house several thousand diehard communists and nationalists bellowed outside mr rutskoi and many deputies spent the night at the white house , and today they resumed issuing resolutions and decrees calling for resistance to mr yeltsin , naming their own ministers of security and defense fearing forced eviction , parliament voted to summon several military units to protect the white house none came , through a number of men with automatic weapons arrived in camouflage fatigues large numbers of uniformed police officers surrounded the building , but to avoid provocation they did not carry sidearms or nightsticks government telephone communications in the white house were cut , leaving deputies with only regular moscow city phones mr yeltsin also canceled the regular parliamentary radio and television programs , denying the deputies their major means of communicating with the public ruslan i khasbulatov , chairman of parliament and the real leader of the opposition , emerged at one point on a balcony and spoke to the demonstrators he thanked the crowd for coming to protect democracy and declared we had no other choice but to stop a man who has chosen the path of crime opponents lack a quorum the major efforts of the legislature seemed to be focused on convening the congress of people s deputies , the 1 , 033member assembly that under the sovietera constitution wields the ultimate legislative authority mr yeltsin also dissolved the congress television news said 400 deputies had registered at the congress 689 are required for a quorum there were no reports of efforts to block the deputies , but the momentum seemed to be with mr yeltsin mr yeltsin also received a pledge of loyalty from another critical quarter , the central bank and its chairman , viktor v gerashchenko under russian law , the senior ministries and the central bank are subordinate to the supreme soviet , and their decision to side with mr yeltsin stripped the deputies of a major potential source of resistance these announcements were accompanied by a steady stream of upbeat statements from mr yeltsin s ministers and lieutenants , all duly reported by a state television network the ready support of critical officials and the pace of mr yeltsin s actions suggested that his team was following a careful plan to give a sense of confidence and calm yegor t gaidar , the architect of mr yeltsin s economic reforms , who was restored to the government last week after an exile of eight months , outlined economic priorities in his new capacity as first deputy prime minister pressed by reporters about the defiant deputies , he feigned a lack of interest and said that after several days , they would tire of sitting around and will return to their duties mr yeltsin himself issued decrees nullifying mr rutskoi s decrees the central image shown repeatedly on television was mr yeltsin , smiling and at ease , first bantering with the heads of the army and security services , then mingling with people on his impromptu stroll through central moscow
houston , jan 2 the role of kingmaker is not what it used to be in texas politics in fact , it has become a major headache for gov ann w richards , who has repeatedly put off naming someone to replace senator lloyd bentsen when he becomes treasury secretary in the clinton cabinet for almost a month now , ms richards has been interviewing prospective candidates to fill the senate seat until a special election , likely to be called for may 1 but , instead of having her pick among political heavyweights , she has been left to choose among several candidates with only modest followings because so many obvious contenders have pulled out of the running the stakes are especially high for the democrats because this is a seat they have held since the reconstruction era and because the election will come just as the first 100 days of the clinton administration are ending even so , some senior democrats have opted to pursue their careers in austin rather than washington , reflecting the diminished luster of service in congress another discouraging factor is that replacing mr bentsen would be a very short free ride followed by a long rocky road ms richards s choice will face the prospect of as many as four expensive statewide races in just 22 months , a special election and runoff in the spring , then a primary and general election in 1994 , when mr bentsen s term ends a lot of fundraising it is no wonder that several of the likeliest candidates have turned it down because whoever gets the seat from richards will have to battle for it this year and then be busy raising money , campaigning and doing business in washington to fight for it all over again , said richard murray , a professor of political science at the university of houston ms richards herself is among those who has snubbed the idea of joining the senate even so , many democrats are pressing her to run rather than put up a weak candidate the situation is only slightly better for the texas republicans , who at least have one strong candidate , state treasurer kay bailey hutchison but mrs hutchison , who takes a moderate abortion rights position , has been attacked by ardent antiabortion republicans in past races and is virtually certain to face criticism on this issue again from at least one other likely candidate , representative joe barton of ennis ideologically fractured in addition , the republican party has many other interested candidates , leaving it the prospect of having so many people in the race that republican votes will be fractured both geographically and ideologically and , a potential wild card in the race could be introduced by richard w fisher , a wealthy dallas investor and longtime democrat who worked as a policy adviser and occasional spokesman for ross perot s presidential campaign a selfmade millionaire with extensive political connections , mr fisher is on the board of advisers of the democratic leadership council , the organization of moderate democrats that served as an important springboard for bill clinton mr fisher says he is considering running as a democrat but with an independent agenda if i decide to run , it will be to carry forward the message of the perot campaign , and if i have to spend my own money to do that , so be it , he said in an interview given that it is such a weak and divided field , the assumption that i would start out at a disadvantage is bogus no one has a tremendous advantage freeforall ballot under texas law mr bentsen s replacement will be selected in an open election with all candidates , regardless of party affiliation , appearing on the same ballot if no candidate gets more than 50 percent of the vote , a runoff would be held for the top two since such elections usually draw a very voter low turnout , interest groups like labor unions and women s organizations , play an important role because they can mobilize constituencies henry g cisneros was the one potential candidate considered most likely to form such a consensus , but the former mayor of san antonio pulled himself out of contention early on and was named by mr clinton to be secretary of housing and urban development former lieut gov bill hobby appeared a front runner for a few days , but then dropped out of contention subsequently , two democrats who won statewide offices in 1990 , state comptroller john sharp and attorney general dan morales , withdrew amid indications that they lacked support from important interest groups democratic officials say the governor s short list now includes three congressmen , mike andrews of houston , jim chapman of sulphur springs and john bryant of dallas , as well as bob krueger , who twice failed in bids for the senate and now sits on the texas railroad commission , the elected body that regulates the oil industry that list delights fred meyer , the texas republican chairman nobody is saying anyone of them is a shooin , he said none of the congressmen is well known outside their district and each of them has vulnerabilities we 'll be happy to raise with the electorate further complicating the democratic scene is the potential candidacy of jim mattox , the former state attorney general who ran a hardhitting campaign against ms richards in the 1990 primary for governor a political maverick who is well known statewide , mr mattox says he may run regardless of whether there is an anointed democratic candidate and , if ms richards names someone perceived as a weak candidate , other democrats , including one or more of those passed over , are expected to jump in on the chance that they could make the runoff with a small fraction of the vote faced with a potential fracas , a number of prominent democrats are now publicly pleading with ms richards to enter the race democrats' best shot bill white , a houston lawyer who is an important democratic fundraiser , said , she is the one democrat with the best chance of keeping other democrats off the field and of thus giving the party the best chance to win this key race mr white and others who have made the pleas say ms richards has given them no encouragement in private and concede that she has virtually ruled out a race in her public statements still , the most commonly discussed scenario would have her remain as governor and name a caretaker to the senate , someone like onetime representative barbara jordan , to hold the post until the special election whether she is badgering legislators or throwing birthday parties for her grandchildren at the governor s mansion , ms richards genuinely seems to be enjoying her first term as governor in addition , several friends and advisers who said they have discussed the matter with ms richards said she was concerned about her own personal finances because she has no means of support other than her salary one friend who would not speak for attribution said , ann knows she would be giving up the mansion and a staff that looks after her for life in an efficiency apartment on capitol hill photo gov ann w richards of texas \( paul conklin for the new york times \)
to the editor peter wyden is to be congratulated for having written stella \( review , nov 1 \) , the biography of stella goldschlag , the infamous gestapo informer a jew herself , she was responsible for the arrest and subsequent murder of several hundred jews who lived in hiding in berlin to save their lives \( possibly even more than 2 , 000 , according to mr wyden s carefully researched book \) i myself lived underground in berlin during the last two and a half years of the war and was acquainted with stella from an earlier time i still felt a chill coming down my spine \( almost 50 years after the fact \) when i read the description in the book of an arrest by stella of a jewish friend of hers at a berlin subway station that i occasionally used for those of us who lived underground in berlin and who were known to stella from earlier times , she was a source of constant terror all of our activities were governed by the need to evade her stella went into hiding in february 1943 but within four months was discovered by a jewish catcher for the gestapo according to mr wyden , her subsequent beating by the gestapo was exclusively directed toward extorting information from her about the young jewish man who had forged many id s , including stella s , but fortunately she did not know his hideout her boyfriend and later husband , rolf isaaksohn , offered his services as a catcher by bragging that he could assemble an entire train of deportees soon the two of them worked as a pair on their catching excursions having lived in hiding themselves , they knew exactly where to look for underground jews in fact , they were much more effective than any gestapo official would have been on the hunt primo levi , frequently quoted by mr wyden , introduced the category of gray \( or ambiguous \) people in his thoughtful book the drowned and the saved by that he meant collaborators under duress whose quota of guilt grows apace with their freedom of choice how can we , with our incomplete knowledge of the circumstances , assess the extent of stella s freedom of choice when she agreed to become a catcher \? there are many examples of jews who turned down the offer to save their own lives in return for delivering others mr wyden mentions a few such cases apparently none of the other prisoners caught with id s from the same source as that of stella became a catcher even if we give her the benefit of the doubt and assume that her decision to become a catcher was not entirely of her own free will , we then have to raise the question of how she exercised whatever freedom of choice she had while working as a catcher it is here that the overwhelming evidence is against her stella carried out her job as a catcher with tremendous enthusiasm and inventiveness according to mr wyden , she participated in the beating of prisoners whenever she arrested a woman , she would immediately search her purse for an address book with addresses of additional hidden jews , which frequently resulted in an avalanche of even more arrests \( ie , murders \) in the summer of 1944 \( ! \) stella obtained the promise by a high gestapo official to be declared aryan after a german victory she would definitely not have acted the way she did had she been forced against her will to carry out her odious tasks in fact , she bet on a german victory stella caused the murder of hundreds \( possibly thousands \) of jews she was by all accounts the most successful of the catchers operating in berlin all of these facts , plus the testimony of eyewitnesses , indicate that stella s main motive in working for the gestapo was to save her own life and liberty by delivering as many jews as possible to the murderers stella was tried and convicted by a west german court in berlin in 1972 and received a 10year sentence , but was then immediately set free because by law she received credit for the 10 years she had served earlier in soviet prisons for the same crimes it is hard to believe that the 10year sentence given to her by the german court was an accident the judges must have intended to set her free the only just sentence for her would have been imprisonment for life with no possibility of parole , thus making it impossible for her to benefit from her crimes when mr wyden visited stella for his interviews a few years ago , he located her in a charming town in southwestern germany , which he describes as fitting for a tourist poster the hills , with their sunflooded , terraced vineyards , nearly touched the little river flowing placidly past the park benches one of the choice residential neighborhoods this was beethoven country , not hitler country in contrast to the place where her victims ended after having been deported , gassed and forgotten pure hitler country ! mr wyden never seems to recognize the farce of stella s sentence , which made her a free person at the expense of those she delivered to be murdered to be sure , he strongly condemns stella and even pronounces her guilty , but he feels compelled always to balance such statements with exonerating opinions he writes that he was n't entirely comfortable with the guilty verdicts , and therefore decided to talk to some survivors who had known stella but had not been witnesses at her trial two of them had actually run into stella in the street while they were underground , and in a rare mood of magnanimity stella declined to arrest them none of them pronounced stella guilty but mr wyden neglected to listen to the voices of those who can no longer be heard , like edith ziegler , arrested by stella at the uhlandstrasse subway station frau steiner and her four children and frau katz with her two children , all arrested by stella in their hideout apartment on lothringer strasse and hundreds of others who were murdered because of stella does mr wyden really believe that they would have absolved stella \? who should listen to them if not the author of this book \? justice has not been done in this case , just as with too many other holocaustrelated crimes , and therefore a dangerous precedent has been set ernest gunter fontheim ann arbor , mich
bischofferode , germany , july 20 a mine that nobody seems to want but the men and women who work in it has become a symbol of the bitter mood of betrayal that has soured the joy of german reunification , three years after capitalism came here to the eastern part of the country a collection of weatherbeaten brick buildings clustered at the foot of a mountain of red tailings that dwarfs the halftimbered houses of the town below , the thomas munzer mine is now occupied by its 700 employees only that many remain of the 1 , 900 who had worked here until communism collapsed today 40 of them vowed to continue a threeweekold hunger strike to protest the planned shutdown of the mine at the end of this year the government liquidators of formerly stateowned communist enterprises sold it to the giant western german chemical conglomerate basf , which plans to close it in a consolidation of the lossmaking potash mining industry in both eastern and western germany we 've lost 25 , 000 jobs in this area just in the last three years , said walter ertmer , a 39yearold member of the mine employees' factory council the people of eastern germany have made tremendous sacrifices for unification , but the politicians in bonn are just letting basf wipe out the competition and establish a monopoly for itself sellout is seen for mr ertmer and millions of other eastern germans , reunification was a vast sellout that made the 62 million people of the capitalist west richer and the 16 million of the nearly bankrupt east poorer the people here do n't want communism back , he said they feel let down by all the political parties by and large , western german wessis , who feel that eastern german ossis want a quick free ride to the prosperity it took them 40 years to achieve , seem to have little sympathy , though the miners' leaders said they had received letters of support and contributions in bonn , chancellor helmut kohl personally guaranteed a government offer of employment at other jobs for the 700 miners here until the end of 1995 if they would stop their hunger strike but the strikers seemed unimpressed how do we know he 'll still be in a position to keep his promise in 1995 \? asked gerhard juttermann , deputy head of the factory council mr kohl rode unification euphoria to his last national election victory in 1990 and will have to face the voters again at the end of next year still has customers few would argue that the communist potash industry , which employed 32 , 000 workers , could survive as it was under market conditions but the miners here said they still had customers for their product , buyers in france , the netherlands and scandinavia who used it to make chemical fertilizer easterners are not the only ones who say that what followed the end of communism has been a raw deal for many of the ordinary people who suffered under it the biggest scandal of reunification is that by and large it s not the east but the west that got richer because of it , said karl otto pohl , a financier in frankfurt when he was head of the german central bank in 1989 , he warned mr kohl that converting east german marks to west german ones at a rate of 1 to 1 would bankrupt industry in the east overnight , by making their wage costs much higher than they had been the chancellor did so anyway , because east german savers and wage earners wanted it then , and it was a disaster just under two million people were out of jobs in the eastern part of the country at the end of june , with 862 , 017 more on governmentsupported work or retraining programs in effect , an unemployment rate of well over 20 percent investing in service industry much private investment has come to eastern germany , even from abroad , but most of it is going to the small eastern german service industry , not to rebuild antiquated and inefficient steel , chemical , mining and machinemanufacturing industries that just duplicate what giant western german companies do better already the eastern german agricultural sector , with vast fields that were assembled by collectivization , used to produce wheat and other grains on an almost american scale , but much of it now lies dormant mr pohl said that on his way home from his office in frankfurt , in western germany , he passes countless tiny fields planted with wheat subsidized by european community policies that favor small farmers we do n't need any of the industries that east germany has , ulrich pfeiffer , an opposition social democratic public sector expert in bonn , said when unification began we should just close them all down and pay the east germans not to produce anything he was joking , but that , in effect , is what the government did but the miners here are not resigned to collecting unemployment for the rest of their lives thomas munzer , whose name stands over the entrance gate , led the peasants' revolt here in 1525 , and the strike leaders have now staked their hopes on the possibility that the european community s executive commission in brussels , now investigating the fusion plans , might rule that they violate antitrust regulations two mines in west affected the potash subsidy of basf , kali und salz ag in kassel , strenuously denied any designs on monopoly but insisted that keeping the bischofferode works was economically unfeasible , and the national mine workers' union agreed the company also said that in the consolidation , about 1 , 700 miners in two of its mines in western germany will also have to find other work we completely reject the charge that a west german concern is trying to rationalize at the expense of east german workers , the company s top officials said in a letter to all employees this month the management promised to use the 600 million being contributed by the government liquidation agency to modernize the mines that will remain in this part of the country after the shakeout the last two of the hunger strikers who had been without food since the action began on july 1 broke off the action today and were taken in weakened condition to a hospital we do n't want anybody to carry things too far , said erich heberstreit , a 37yearold father of two who joined the hunger strike monday we 'll carry on until we get a good and convincing written explanation from somebody of why the mine ca n't be kept operating , and then we 'll see asked what future he saw for himself or his sons here , he said probably none if the mine closes , i 'd have to tell them we 'll have to move to the west , because that s where the jobs are photo about 40 employees of the thomas munzer mine in bischofferode , germany , vowed yesterday to continue a threeweekold hunger strike to protest the shutdown of the mine at the end of this year gisela bernd , right , and three other workers started their hunger strike last weekend \( jens meyer for the new york times \) map of germany shows location of bischofferode
washington , aug 5 if politics is theater , as the skeptics say , tonight was classic hitchcock , with a very large dose of frank capra there on the house floor , bill clinton s budget package and his presidency clung to credibility every bit like eva marie saint in north by northwest , clinging to the face of mount rushmore mr clinton s democratic supporters held a 216to214 margin four democrats still had not voted two of them , representatives david minge of minnesota and ray thornton of arkansas , had been considered likely to vote against the measure , bringing the nays equal to the 216 yeas the third , representative pat williams of montana , was sure to support it , giving the yeas a onevote edge again that seemed to leave mr clinton s fate up to representative marjorie margoliesmezvinsky , a firstterm pennsylvania democrat who had voted against the package in may , when it first came before the house in the pandemonium , she stood at the front of the house chamber representative sander m levin of michigan , a supporter of the measure , was grasping her by the shoulders , his face inches from hers , struggling to be heard above the roar of the 432 other lawmakers on the floor house speaker thomas s foley of washington , jaw tight , stood nearby republicans were flooding the chamber with photocopies of a recent article from the philadelphia inquirer and chanting , goodbye , marjorie it was headlined , margoliesmezvinsky will again cast vote against democrats then the house lawmakers , aides , packed gallery , press fell utterly silent finally , ms margoliesmezvinsky and mr williams approached the speaker s dais , filled out green cards signifying yea , and presented them to the clerk mr minge and mr thornton abruptly turned in their nays , and mr clinton s budget proposal was pulled , abruptly and at the last second , back from the precipice ms margoliesmezvinsky , who comes from a conservative district , had cast a potentially careerwrecking vote did the democrats have some votes in reserve \? probably , but that is part of the theater , too representative dan rostenkowski of chicago , who negotiated the budget package with the senate , stood outside the big door of his office just off the house floor , tears welling up in his eyes and trickling down his face i guess they focused on what was important for the country , he said kerrey agonizes meanwhile , in the senate , senator bob kerrey of nebraska , for a while last year a rival for the presidential nomination and now the last democrat that mr clinton needs to guarantee the passage of the budget package in that chamber , was having trouble making up his mind mr kerrey is legendary for his sincere , if prolonged , public anguish over matters of state , so much so that he gained the nickname cosmic bob during his brief run for the presidency last year most everyone else among the 100 elders made up their minds about mr clinton s budget package days ago mr kerrey s indecision is driving the administration a little nuts our next trouble spot , one senior administration official matteroffactly calls him pursuing the strays not long after dawn broke , the democratic whips in the house went to the lash at 9 am , the entire pack met to prepare a list of wavering democrats and decide which of them would birddog which undecideds at 10 30 am , a group of about 15 whips and other lawmakers met for a progress report they met again and again and again at 1 30 , at 4 , at 6 , and just before the breathlessly close vote at the end of a draining day sometimes the targets actually want to be lobbied today , it was more of a varmint hunt the undecideds wanted pressure to vote for a tax increase about as much as iowa wants more rain , and so they tended to vanish that forced the democratic leaders to stage meaningless votes and quorum calls to flush them out of hiding and onto the house floor there , like big , expensively dressed and coiffed raccoons caught in car headlights , they were pounced on by the whips and relentlessly blandished with promises of favors and political support if that did n't work , they were hauled before speaker foley or called in for sessions with administration heavies or with himself representative bill sarpalius of texas talked by phone with mr clinton four times today before deciding , about an hour before the vote , to switch from foe to friend the president hit him with right and left hooks a pledge to schedule a vote in congress on a balanced budget amendment , and the news , at 8 pm , that 62 , 219 lowincome taxpayers in his district would receive an extra 109 million in tax credits next year should the package pass that s pretty impressive , mr sarpalius said representative norman mineta of california , as loyal a democrat as exists , was also rumbling about voting no until mr clinton called mr mineta , a transportation subcommittee chairman , was angry because revenues from the 43centagallon gasoline tax were destined for new deficitreduction trust fund instead of the highway trust fund , where they are reserved for roadbuilding and mass transit
washington , oct 11 it is a quintessential sam nunn moment a difficult question on the use of american force , a restive congress , a president struggling for consensus the senior senator from georgia , chairman of the armed services committee , is careful others on capitol hill are calling for deadlines and a rapid withdrawal from somalia , but not mr nunn , much to the relief of the administration still , he is raising questions about american strategy and troop deployment , not only in somalia but also in haiti and , potentially , bosnia it s time for us to be fully briefed , he says of haiti congress needs to be brought in on the action here this is mr nunn s view of his role and his politics substantive , steeped in expertise and senatorial prerogative , as one who advises and consents \( or not \) outside the rough partisan fray this is the role he devoutly desires again he acknowledges that the longrunning battle over homosexuals in the military has hurt his political image although , he says , not in georgia he is still angry over the endless scrutiny of his motives , the accusation that his opposition to president clinton s proposal to lift the ban on gay troops was motivated by everything from prejudice against homosexuals to thwarted ambitions for a cabinet post to jealousy that it was another southern democrat , and not he , who ended up in the white house irresistible to pundits the 55yearold georgian , a model of conservative southern rectitude , bristles at what he describes as a lie down on the couch , we are going to psychoanalyze you kind of attention from the news media but he has become an irresistible analysand for the pundits his relationships with presidents especially this one , a fellow democrat , fellow southerner and fellow leader of the democratic leadership council are too interesting his influence , despite the enemies created by the searing battle over the ban on gay troops , is too strong , particularly at moments like this it matters when he appears on nbc news' meet the press , as he did on sunday , and says the united states needs to more narrowly define its mission in somalia and think again about the deployment of troops in the very hostile environment of haiti as congress escalates its debate on somalia this week , administration officials are respectful , even a trace deferential , toward mr nunn despite the trouble mr nunn has caused this white house , his power is recognized i think no democratic foreign policy is going to get very far , particularly one with a military aspect to it , unless it s blessed by sam nunn , an administration official said last weekend a white house official , who also spoke on condition he not be identified , even though his comments were laudatory , said , he s doing his job , being supportive so far , asking the right questions often backs president those who inhabit both sides of this relationship are careful to present any strains as highminded disagreements over issues clinton political advisers , in fact , point to statistics showing that mr nunn has voted the president s way with respectable frequency according to congressional quarterly , as of oct 4 mr nunn had voted with the administration 72 percent of the time by contrast , the unapologetic democratic renegade , senator richard c shelby of alabama , had voted with the president 41 percent of the time still , mr nunn bucked mr clinton on two of the biggest fights of the year the president s deficit reduction plan , and , most significantly , the proposal to lift the military s ban on homosexuals none of it , mr nunn says , was personal he says he told mr clinton in august 1992 , at a gathering at the home of pamela harriman , the democratic fund raiser now serving as ambassador to france , that the promise to lift the ban was a real mistake could i have avoided all of this \? he said in an interview maybe , if i had said in august of 1992 , 'either you reverse your position or i am going to lead a crusade against your candidacy' i was n't prepared to do that , and i'm glad i did n't do that still , neither was he prepared to back down when mr clinton was in office mr nunn maintained that lifting the ban , and thus letting homosexuals serve openly , would endanger unit cohesion and combat readiness and for that , which helped lead to the eventual policy of do n't ask , do n't tell , he acquired the enduring enmity of gay rights advocates 'a jesse helms democrat' he held hearings that made a mockery of the term 'fairness , ' and generally distorted the issue with great skill , said gregory king , a spokesman for the human rights campaign fund , a lobbying group for gay and lesbian rights he s a jesse helms democrat looking back on the controversy , mr nunn said i think to those who read the new york times editorial page and take it seriously , it has been very damaging thankfully , that does n't include the majority of people in georgia there has certainly been damage to me in intellectual circles and among the people who follow editorial policy , he added , because clearly the editorial part of the news media has been very much in the mode of equating anybody who has my view on the subject , who believes the military is unique , as being the equivalent of racist
the bus stops there q why are bus stops in manhattan almost always placed beyond traffic lights rather than at the lights \? it seems to be a waste of passenger time as well as fuel since the bus must usually stop twice once at the light and again at the bus stop can this actually be deliberate \? a it is n't a conspiracy to make you miss your bus , said lisa daglian , the woman who knows it all at the department of transportation , the agency that decides where bus stops go we do it for safety reasons if buses stopped at the lights , she explained , people crossing the street in front of or behind a bus could enter a blind spot of the bus driver or of other drivers , and might be hit as a result you might not agree with this theory , but the department plans to relocate any bus stops that are in fact placed at traffic lights one ringydingy q when you call information now , your call is answered by a recorded voice \( always the same chirpy woman \) who says new york telephone it is very peculiar because then someone else gets on the phone who has a totally different voice this has been going on for about six months i asked an operator about it and she said it was to save their voices a consider it akin to station identifications that television stations make at programming intervals this is how we brand our company , said john bonomo , a spokesman for nynex , the parent company of new york telephone some people may not realize who they are reaching and who provides this service nynex recently decided that it wanted to make its customers aware of the parent company rather than the subsidiary , so beginning on jan 1 , the recorded message will say , thank you for calling nynex did you also know , you who seem not to own a phone book , that right before the 411 operator picks up , there is sometimes a recorded message hello , this is \( operator s name \) what borough please \? the operators record this at the beginning of their shifts and use it all day to save their voices , as you were told gratitude for an s' turn q the flushing no 7 line seems to run from grand central to times square along 42d street , yet at some point near fifth avenue it makes a sharp s turn what is it avoiding \?

a in the july 1950 issue of library journal , i g grimshaw wrote that when one leg of the horse is raised , it means its rider suffered a wound in battle in the book other statues of boston , alan forbes said that a horse reared up on two legs indicates that the rider was killed in battle , and that a horse with four legs on the ground carries a rider who died of natural causes in the cupping room q what is the origin of the name of the delightful restaurant on west broadway called the cupping room \? none of the waiters seem sure of the answer a cupping is a britishism that was once used to describe the act of drinking liquor or having a drinking bout around 1616 , a cupping house was referred to as a place to drink the folks at the cupping room have creatively reinterpreted that description to fit these somewhat soberer times a manager said that cupping meant the mixing of various types of coffee the restaurant , once just a coffee shop , serves all three meals so perhaps a cupping room is now a place to mix coffee , arugula and a budweiser yes , a water statue q there is a statue partly submerged in the water off the southern tip of manhattan what s it all about \?

merengue plays continuously over the speakers at the gelines grocery in the western bronx every so often santos montilla , the proprietor , gets caught up in the music and , while talking to a customer , drums out the beat with his hands on cartons of canned food and soft drinks stacked in the narrow aisles it is a nervous gesture mr montilla , only 20 , was thrown prematurely into running the family bodega by the death of his father , damaso , who was shot on aug 5 the shooting was one of numerous acts of violence that mar the lives of thousands of immigrants who , by opening small food stores , try to get a foothold in the new york economy right now , the foothold is tenuous , not only at gelines grocery but at many small food stores owned by immigrant families , whether they are koreans , chinese or , like the montillas , dominican the weak economy has made sales fall and well before damaso montilla was killed as he returned home from the store by unknown assailants perhaps bent on robbery the family s takehome income had dropped from more than 600 a week in better times to nearly nothing we do n't make anything , the son said , explaining in spanish that sales had shrunk to 17 , 000 a week a barely breakeven level from more than 20 , 000 in the 1980 s i have to squeeze out money from store funds for my car and for the family s expenses , but even this is hard for many new yorkers , korean greengrocers are the most familiar examples of immigrant entrepreneurs their stores are everywhere , while hispanic bodegas stay mostly within latin neighborhoods but dominicans have come in huge numbers in recent years and now operate more small stores in new york city than any other ethnic group over 6 , 000 , according to the dominican association of merchants and professionals despite the hard times , mr montilla and his stepmother , altagracia montilla , talk of selling out at a handsome profit someday mr montilla would then be free , he says , to get a highschool equivalency diploma and go to college for computer engineering or he might skip college and buy a mcdonald s franchise , if i can find the right location even as he talks hopefully of the future , mr montilla admits he might never make it beyond the bodega at 179th street and university avenue but surely , he says , his two younger stepbrothers and his stepsister will they are in high school and are kept away from the store one stepbrother , albin , is a star high school baseball player and once traveled to japan for a championship little league playoff , mr montilla says proudly although he is tied to the store for 12 and 14hour days , mr montilla dresses more like a college student than a bodega owner , appearing on a recent day in a blueandredstriped rugby shirt , brown khaki pants and thin , oval glasses he joined his father in the united states six years ago like most owners , he speaks little english and relies on a bilingual accountant to deal with the city an outgoing , goodnatured man , mr montilla often greets his dominican customers by name but he keeps a revolver in the store for protection in a neighborhood where blacks , dominicans and puerto ricans live uneasily together and he and his halfdozen employees \( none earns above the minimum wage \) patrol the aisles for shoplifters adding to the pressure , mr montilla has borrowed 20 , 000 from a loan company at a rate of 30 percent a year his father , in addition , left him years' worth of unpaid water bills , amounting to 38 , 000 the landlord took me to court and i have paid some of it , and i have planned to pay the rest , at 1 , 000 a month , mr montilla said the pinched times are evident in the store s pricing strategy the bestselling items are drinks beer , bottled water , sodas and every flavor of fruit juice these fill the refrigerated , selfservice cases along one side of the store and as mr montilla and an employee , manuel badia , unpacked newly delivered cases , they stuck prices on each bottle that included a 40percent markup packaged food , household items and dairy products are different like many bodegas , the gelines grocery resembles a miniature supermarket in the variety of merchandise it carries but it must compete with a supermarket three blocks away , and price markups are generally kept low the bodega client , coming in here from the neighborhood or from the buses that stop outside the store , buys the items that he needs or wants right away , while the supermarket customer does a big shopping , said mr badia , a former bodega owner whose own store failed dairy products , the worst sellers at gelines grocery , return only 7 percent more than their cost , and many food or kitchen items ca n't be marked up more than 15 percent , which is very little in a business where larger markups are the norm to cover expenses and leave a profit snacks like potato chips , on the other hand , sell well , and they are displayed on shelves near the front of the store mr montilla has to purchase them for cash other suppliers give him credit , but rarely for more than 30 days to help make ends meet , mr montilla , and many other owners , have allowed pinball machines into the store gelines has two but the worst problem for the city s small groceries may be the landlord commercial properties are free of rent control a bodega owner can spend a halfdozen years furnishing a store and building up a business , then , at the end of the lease , face not only a sharply higher rent but also a fee for a new lease this has already happened once to the montillas , and they expect it will happen again when their lease expires in 1996 a few months before damaso montilla s death , the landlord advised the montillas that he would sign a 15year lease with them at a rent of 3 , 500 , a 500 increase but the montillas would have to pay the landlord 55 , 000 protesting such treatment , the dominican merchants association is urging the city council to enact a bill , already before the council , that would provide for arbitration in rent disputes but mr montilla and his stepmother say they will pay the 55 , 000 , and when times improve , they will sell the store , and the remaining years on the lease what are you going to do \? mr montilla said this is a valuable store on a good corner , near colleges , and people come here from other areas sales at least have not fallen below 17 , 000 a week , and when they pick up again , we 'll be all right photo santos montilla runs celines grocery , his family s bodega in the

washington , feb 6 during a meeting of the president s top economic advisers last week , the deputy budget director , alice m rivlin , was describing areas of the country that would be affected by the withdrawal of a federal timber subsidy when she found herself being corrected by president clinton over which trees were found where a short time later , mr clinton s top foreign policy advisers were gathered in the roosevelt room poring over a map of bosnia , in a nearly fourhour session intended to establish the administration s policy for the balkans , its first major foreignpolicy initiative the president did not correct anyone about details on bosnia he did not attend while bill clinton is being accused of stepping back from some campaign promises , there is one promise that for now he appears to be holding firm to spending less time than his predecessor enmeshed in the nitty gritty of foreign policy when mr clinton gathered his cabinet and other top advisers at camp david last weekend , some in the room were struck by what was missing when he ticked off what he viewed as the goals of his administration for the first 100 days no mention of foreign policy the list went like this economic recovery plan , health care plan , welfare reform , political reform , national service there was not a single mention of a foreignpolicy objective no wonder some lowerranking members of mr clinton s foreign policy team have confided to their colleagues working on economic and health policy about how jealous they are at the quality time the numbercrunchers get to spend with the president , as compared with those dealing with foreign affairs the president has basically told us all , if he can get an economic package through congress and a health package through congress , everything will be all right , said one senior administration official if he ca n't , it wo n't be all right i'm sure he s interested in foreign policy , but right now it s just not where he is focused it s not where he is emersing himself in the details none of us would accuse him of micromanaging it it is not that mr clinton is ignoring the myriad problems that confront the united states abroad , say aides , but rather that he has essentially delegated foreignpolicy formulation to secretary of state warren christopher , defense secretary les aspin , the national security adviser , w anthony lake and mr lake s deputy , samuel r berger on domestic policy issues , mr clinton is personally absorbed in the give and take but on foreign policy he has basically asked these aides to work out solutions and then submit them to him to be approved or rejected policies and briefings under broad guidelines set by mr clinton , they worked out the policy on how to limit the influx of haitian refugees and then briefed him about it they worked out the compromise on the deportees in lebanon and then briefed him about it , and they are working up the new policy for bosnia and briefing him about it they were also the architects of a more integrated approach to coordinating policy toward russia and the other former soviet republics obviously , say aides , the president is kept abreast of all the internal discussions and weighs in when he wants which can be fairly frequently but foreign affairs is clearly not his passion , or his preoccupation he is there to do things when asked , said one foreignpolicy official but that is the extent of it some top clinton aides make no apologies for his priorities that is why he is president and george bush is n't , remarked one when asked why the president did not seem very deeply involved in foreign affairs since coming to office mr clinton has had phone conversations with president boris n yeltsin of russia , president leonid m kravchuk of ukraine and prime minister yitzhak rabin of israel he has had brief meetings with prime minister brian mulroney of canada and the german foreign minister , klaus kinkel mr bush did more in an average day mr clinton still has not held a meeting of his national security council at least some who know the president well suggest that he still may be just a little intimidated by foreign matters some even go so far as to suggest that one of the reasons mr clinton chose the 67yearold mr christopher to run his state department is because he sees him as an elder statesman who can take care of the thorny foreignpolicy matters that mr clinton simply does not want to be troubled with now and is still unsure about i think that the most interesting thing is that mr clinton has not been present for a lot of the discussions , said one lowerranking adviser my sense of it is that he does not like this stuff because he is not the master of it he is not familiar with the details and he is not familiar with the people giving him the advice he does not have that same well of knowledge to draw on that he does in domestic policy do n't underestimate how raw he is mr clinton , like his predecessors , begins his day with a briefing from a representative of the central intelligence agency on developments overnight in world affairs , with mr lake , mr berger and vice president al gore also present the white house chief of staff , thomas mclarty , also attends occasionally marching orders

tawashigad , india , oct 3 a pile of rocks and thatch are all that remain of krishna bai mani s home but she and her family survived india s worst earthquake in 50 years and , amid the devastation , have even had enough to eat yes , she smiled , they gave me something they gave me milk they gave me bread , plantains , rice they gave me as much as i wanted , enough to fill my stomach but for mrs mani , and the tens of thousands of people made homeless when the earth shuddered last thursday morning , it is not the government that has come to their aid , but dozens of private relief organizations in this village , and in the 40 or so others destroyed by the earthquake , field kitchens , medical clinics and counseling were made available by hundreds of social workers and volunteers who came here because they felt it was their responsibility to do so , not because the government told them to we got reports that this village had no relief work , said dwarkanath lele , a retired newspaper editor who , at 62 , has joined the social relief organization of his former newspaper , sakal we brought two vehicles with bread and curry it took eight hours to reach here from pune we even brought gas cylinders because we did n't know if we would find anything to cook with just hillocks of rubble this village , now no more than hillocks of rubble punctuated by upright door frames , lies far down a muddy track that skewers fields of blooming mustard flowers outside the village , up a rise near an undamaged temple , sheets of corrugated tin have been fashioned into leanto shelters some people , like mrs mani , simply squatted in front of their former homes below , along the streets of the village , 100 soldiers in camouflage fatigues helped villagers dig through rubble for household supplies to salvage we have found all the bodies , we think , said an army major , who asked that his name not be used because he was not supposed to give interviews altogether about 500 people died here there were about 500 houses here now there are none indian officials said today that about 22 , 000 people died in the earthquake and that 150 , 000 were homeless they also said a united states transport plane carrying tents and shelter material had arrived in bombay what we 're doing now is helping people find their stuff , cooking utensils , beds , the army major said if they want to work , we will help them makeshift camps spring up work is what the survivors are doing throughout this region of eastern maharashtra , ox carts filled with the remains of people s lives moved toward makeshift encampments in freshly plowed fields , men propped up tree limbs to form the frames for leantos and women resumed daily chores as dawn s light took hold today outside the village of narangwadi , a makeshift camp of survivors came to life like any village in india tendrils of smoke from earthen stoves trickled into the orangepurple sky water buffaloes and oxen tied outside tin leantos lowed gently , their cowbells clinking as they flicked their heads my house was totally destroyed , said mana bai , a woman in a worn pink sari who guessed her age at about 40 luckily all of us are alive 50 shelters on farmer s field around her , children scampered about bits and pieces of her home , a few cooking pots , a bundle of clothing , a charpoy the traditional indian cot cluttered her leanto i brought this here with my relatives , she said , on my head whatever was left i took about 50 other shelters were scattered about hers , spread over a farmer s field this place was neat and clean , so we settled here , she said there is a well nearby , so that is good until now , we have food , some grain , from our house on the nearby main road , army vehicles rumbled by , transporting soldiers to more distant villages flatbed trucks lugged bulldozers to shattered settlements to clear rubble but nowhere was there any sign of government relief here in tawashigad , mr lele , the retired editor , said no one expected the government to provide aid it is better not to speak about the government , he said we are doing it only our newspaper set up a relief fund in 1944 when there was a drought in bengal our founder said why should we depend on the government we should be doing it ourselves from then on , we have been doing this work in the village , a new group of volunteers arrived , sturdy young men from tata engineering and locomotive company , armed with sticks and shovels they headed into the rubble to help survivors recover some of their possessions i have never seen something like this , mr lele said actually i wept such an atmosphere smoke was coming up from the funeral pyres 'you help them' at the primary school , its courtyard taken up by mr lele s relief team , the village leader , chandra harsha grotala , stood before the men of his village , his eyes wet with tears , his voice breaking nobody is going to take things not required by him , he said if someone comes with clothes , take one or two that is sufficient there is no use fighting for a loaf or two of bread if you have a loaf , give half to the one next to you if someone needs

chicago , april 9 stay tuned for the next sneaker commercial what happened here today must be a commercial where else but in a 30second television spot could bo jackson amble to the plate for the first time in 18 months in a major league game , with 42 , 775 fans curious about the condition of his artificial hip and awaiting his first swing \? where else could jackson rock a pinchhit home run on the second pitch \? only between cheers and seinfeld but what jackson did was real , not fantasy on the mound , neal heaton simply gazed in amazement as jackson trotted around the bases to his second standing ovation in 30 seconds those sights would fit neatly into a commercial , but other aspects of today s game would have to be edited out because the yankees survived jackson s successful return from hipreplacement surgery and emerged with an 116 victory over the white sox at comiskey park heaton is amazed i'm not amazed that he hit the home run , said heaton i'm amazed that he s even in a major league uniform people do n't realize how hard it is to play this game when you 're healthy i tried my best to get him out , but i hung a pitch and he ripped it the yankees spoiled jackson s dramatic return and chicago s home opener with snazzy hitting of their own jim leyritz ripped his first career grand slam , a 426foot shot off bobby thigpen in the eighth that turned a tworun game into a rout danny tartabull clobbered his second homer of the season to give the yankees a 54 lead they never relinquished randy velarde added his first homer , mike stanley had four hits and spike owen contributed three hits it may not have been sexy enough to sell sneakers , but it was enough to even new york s record at 22 bo had a super hit , but the yankees won the ball game , tartabull said let s get to the relevant point we won wickman struggles in addition to surviving jackson s 400foot homer to right field , the yankees survived on a day when bob wickman struggled and when their bullpen experienced more trouble less than 24 hours after taking a 155 pasting from the indians in cleveland last night wickman was handed a 40 lead after three innings , but he fumbled it back in the fourth and left after five innings with the yankees leading , 74 he was blitzed for five hits , and also walked five against the team that traded him last year and is the only one to defeat him in his brief career artistic , he was not but wickman improved his record to 71 in nine major league outings before wickman could savor the victory , yankee relievers had to notch the last 12 chicago outs , a task that has already proved to be a sticky proposition this year the offense seemed to have made it easy by snapping a 44 tie with three runs in the fifth , and piling on four more with leyritz s grand slam in the eighth to inflate the yankee lead to 115 jackson becomes human but it was touch and go in the bottom of the eighth , when the white sox scored once and had the bases loaded with none out but heaton struck out ozzie guillen and the righthanded john habyan then replaced him to face jackson , who had stayed in the game as the left fielder this time , jackson proved human by striking out habyan then induced craig grebeck to smack into a force play for the third out and pitched a scoreless ninth i never doubted myself , said jackson , whose degenerative hip condition had apparently ended his baseball and football careers it was something special inside pitch outfielder tim raines of the white sox tore a ligament in his right thumb with a headfirst slide in the first inning he will have surgery saturday and is expected to miss six weeks because jim valvano , a former north carolina state basketball coach , is ailing with cancer and unable to attend the season opener at yankee stadium on monday , north carolina s basketball coach , dean smith , will represent him and toss out the first ball umpire al clark obviously did not appreciate steve howe s antics on the mound during cleveland s ninerun seventh inning in the 155 victory over new york yesterday the yankee reliever thought that clark missed the call on a 22 slider to carlos baerga that would have struck out the indian second baseman instead , baerga hit the next pitch for a homer and howe became enraged at the umpire when asked about the borderline pitch afterward , clark was quoted as saying i wonder if he s ever made a mistake or used questionable judgment howe has been suspended from the majors seven times for alcohol and substance abuse violations the yankees were so upset by clark s apparent reference to howe s past that they have contacted the american league about the matter and may ask for the umpire to be reprimanded photo chicago s bo jackson tipping his hat to the comiskey park crowd after his pinch hit home run yesterday afternoon against the yankees \( associated press \) \( pg 29 \)
backstage at the st james theater , the director des mcanuff was summoned to the phone just after the audience had finally stopped cheering for tommy and gone home that was sort of the love call , he explained a few moments later , referring to his conversation with pete townshend , on whose celebrated rock opera the show is based twentyfour hours earlier , mr townshend had been at the st james on a triumphant opening night , after which tommy set a dayafteropening record of nearly 500 , 000 for ticket sales now , back in london , he was maintaining enough of a spiritual presence in new york to time his good wishes precisely to the final curtain no wonder when he wrote the crowd went crazy as tommy hit the stage 24 years ago \( in the lyrics to sally simpson \) , mr townshend nicely anticipated the effect his work would one day have on broadway audiences but it took mr mcanuff , the artistic director of the la jolla playhouse in california and the tonywinning director of big river , to collaborate with the who s mastermind in finding the theatrical heart of tommy together , they have dusted off this rockandroll chestnut and coaxed forth a daring broadway musical the changes overseen by mr mcanuff are so farreaching that it feels as if tommy has been reinvented , though this is still the basic tale of a boy turned by childhood trauma into a deaf , dumb and blind kid , only to emerge from his silence as a charismatic , pinballplaying star musical solos have been broadened into duets or choral numbers a new interplay between adult and boyish tommys strengthens the central character the storytelling has become swift and linear the minimal props whirl across the stage in exuberant motion with a fluid visual backdrop for its story , this sophisticated 6 million production employs 54 projectors for 18 panels at the rear of the stage , images projected onto a gauzy front curtain , television monitors , smoke , mirrors , major mechanical devices beneath the stage floor , and pinball machines that go up in flames or blaze with light all without losing its streamlined nature or precision mr mcanuff had to be persuaded to allow a lighting effect that turns the whole theater into a huge pinball machine to last 11 seconds instead of 7 this was not the work of a pair of fantasists returning to the late 60 s , said the 40yearold mr mcanuff of his collaboration with the 47yearold mr townshend we wanted to do a dramatic version of this piece finished saying goodnight to the cast and crew , mr mcanuff had been surprised by an autograph seeker at the stage door as he headed for a restaurant near the theater now , settled down to dissect tommy over a latenight chicken sandwich , he worked a scene from henry iv into a long explanation of his own acid queen sequence \( one of several in which little tommy is exposed to strong stimuli in this case , a drugaddicted prostitute who may have magical powers that could break his silence \) you 've got to turn to the great teacher when you dramatize something , he said jokingly i do n't mean to be pretentious , but i just ca n't help it he looked pleasantly tired , having almost outlasted john entwistle \( the who s bassist \) during openingnight festivities at an irish bar the night before he would also have looked inconspicuous without the appliqued leather jacket in a bold zebralike pattern , a garment he took off instantly when asked about its origins the producers gave it to me , he said diplomatically i think it , um , evokes the show s logo the jacket was indeed evocative , though not nearly as much as tommy is itself the who s rock opera is so firmly rooted in memories of its era that any broadway modifications were bound to provoke complaints some have suggested that this 90 s tommy , with its gentler , familyminded ending , betrays the toughness of both the 60 s and the who that s the typical selfdestructive side of the intellectual left , replied mr mcanuff to that criticism often , we 've allowed the right wing to abscond with basic notions like family or patriotism we just sit back and allow them to do it , accepting that it must be correct i 've never met anybody who did n't consider families important just on that level alone i reject it he went on to note we were well aware there would be audience members who felt that they kind of own this piece but he emphasized how elliptical the original album actually is about family values and many other things the 1969 tommy is a series of songs , packaged in an order mr townshend never considered sacred and several of them are sung by characters whose identity is never made clear some are performed in a manner that would not work in any other format it was mr townshend himself , after all , who first sang the part of the acid queen mr mcanuff said he approached tommy without preconceptions and without borrowing from ken russell s delirious \( and now dated \) 1975 film he was aware , however , of the extent to which the film had been dominated by nonetoomusical stars singing cameo turns and was glad to escape such limitations in adapting tommy for the stage \( his first version had its premiere last july at the la jolla playhouse \) , he and mr townshend concentrated on character development , dramatic momentum and creating a song order that made more sense
holmdel , nj may 26 in the last statewide forum before new jersey s primary election in two weeks , the three major candidates for the republican gubernatorial nomination met in a televised debate tonight , jousting over policy , campaign bickering and who is best qualified to defeat gov jim florio in november the tone of the townhall style debate members of the audience put questions to the candidates , christine todd whitman , cary edwards and james l wallwork was a marked departure from the previous rancorfilled meetings involving the three republicans business people made up a majority of the audience , and that was reflected in a string of questions on automobile insurance reform , managed health care , unemployment , pollution legislation and sports betting mr edwards , mr wallwork and mrs whitman tended to agree on many issues on the question of restructuring the automobile insurance system , for example , each candidate favored changing the laws to reduce the number of lawsuits from vehicle accidents , offering more insurance options to reduce rates for some drivers , and easing regulations to encourage more companies to write automobile insurance in new jersey the candidates still found the opportunity to lash out at one another a question about new jersey s bleak unemployment rate , from a young woman who said she had recently lost her job , set up the most heated exchange of the evening mrs whitman was giving her response to the question when mr edwards cut her off christie , you do n't understand , the girl does n't have a job today , mr edwards said can you offer her one \? mrs whitman said at least i have had a job in my life , replied mr edwards , who has tried to paint mrs whitman as a wealthy elitist who would be out of touch with the people as governor 'you owe an apology' mrs whitman said in response , i would ask for an apology for that , cary , but i think that you owe an apology to every woman for saying last weekend that you resent having to run against a woman mr edwards said he owed no apology to mrs whitman after the debate mr edwards accused ms whitman of setting him up over the issue , saying that she had misrepresented his comments from a weekend debate that involved only him and mr wallwork as in a televised debate two weeks ago , the clash ended when mr wallwork intervened , telling his rivals to calm down the debate was cosponsored by chapters of the new jersey association of women business owners and by new jersey network , the stateowned broadcasting system it was broadcast live over the network s four televison channels and new jersey cable systems , and over njn radio , which serves central and southern new jersey most important faceoff the sponsors said 500 people paid 10 apiece to be part of the live audience at the gov robert b meyner reception center on the grounds of the garden state arts center the questioners were selected in advance , based on questions they submitted along with their requests for tickets michael aron , a senior political correspondent for new jersey network , moderated the 90minute debate over the last four months , mrs whitman , mr edwards and mr wallwork have engaged in at least half a dozen debates , but none more important than tonight s faceoff it was the last of two mandatory debates for candidates who have qualified for public campaign financing in the primary the first was held on may 11 in whippany but more important , it was the last chance for voters to make a sidebyside comparison of the three candidates before primary day , june 8 crowd seems uncommitted each candidate had a contingent of supporters in the audience , but except for a consensus in favor of lower taxes , a majority of the crowd appeared to be uncommitted sidney israel , a rumson , nj , engineeer who attended the debate with his wife , rhoda , said what we got from the florio administration was a tremendous loss of jobs out of state and a huge increase in the cost of living if i had a question for the candidates , it would be about improving the economy enough to level these things out rhoda israel was more pointed my concern is about programs to give tax money to private schools , she said i do n't think we should cross that line mrs whitman , the leading republican candidate , repeated her support for for taxfinanced school vouchers payable to private schools , although with a test program first mr wallwork , a former state senator , said the voucher quesiton should be settled in a public referendum , while mr edwards , a former state attorney general , held to his oppostion to voucher programs according to the state election law enforcement commission , mr florio , mrs whitman and mr edwards each have qualified for the maximum 16 million in matching funds mr wallwork has qualified for 800 , 000 in matching funds , according to his campaign media push beginning mr florio is running unopposed in the primary and has not participated in any primary debates the televised njn debates and very expensive broadcast advertisements on television and radio stations in new jersey , new york city and philadelphia are important parts of the strategy for each campaign in the final days before the june 8 primary elections
a new chapter is being written in the longrunning border war between new york and new jersey angered by a recently enacted new york state law that requires new jersey limousine operators to license their vehicles and drivers in new york city if they want to pick up passengers there , new jersey officials are preparing to impose similar regulations on new york limousines that venture into new jersey leaders of new jersey s limousine industry which includes about 1 , 200 companies and more than 14 , 000 drivers say a significant portion of their business involves round trips in which the second half is technically a new york pickup the fees for registering car and driver in new york under the new law would be about 300 a year in february , the bergen county board of chosen freeholders passed an ordinance that subjects all new york limousines that pick up passengers in bergen county to similar registration requirements and similar costs and now state senator john p scott , republican of lyndhurst , is preparing legislation that would impose similar licensing requirements statewide support from 2 counties the essex county and hudson county boards of chosen freeholders have both passed resolutions in support of the bergen ordinance new york and bergen county have not started enforcing the new laws thus far , though new york city officials say they intend to do so within the next 30 days but new jersey officials say they hope their tough reaction will inspire new york city officials to change their minds new york city is trying to stick its hand in our pocket to raise revenue , and that s wrong , said bergen county freeholder anthony cassano , who sponsored the limousine ordinance mr scott said they 're forcing us to do this we ca n't undo their tax , so we 're going to tax them you can call it retaliatory , but i consider it an equity tax this is mr scott s second move in the border wars he is the cosponsor of a measure now before the legislature that imposes a socalled commuter tax on outofstate workers whose jobs are in new jersey the measure allows new jersey to tax outofstate workers at the same rate that new york taxes new jersey residents who work there new york city officials say the limousine law is intended to cut down on the number of illegal , unregistered car services operating in the city representatives of the new jersey limousine industry say the law is unnecessary because the state s limousines and drivers are already licensed by new jersey they add that it would lead to increased fares for interstate riders al serafin , president of the new jersey limousine association , said the law would probably make it necessary for many limousine companies to license all their cars and drivers in new york city if they enforce this law , we would have to see a 4 to 6 percent increase in our prices , mr serafin said he was present at a meeting of the new york city taxi and limousine commission last november , he said , and right there they stated that they 're trying to raise an additional 20 million for their budget charge called 'rubbish' fidel f del valle , chairman of the city s taxi and limousine commission , called that charge pure , unadulterated rubbish he said the city expected to register a total of 1 , 800 vehicles , which , he added , are not going to make or break the bank he said that outoftown cars that register under the law would become exempt from new york city s 400 roaduse tax , which is already supposed to be paid by every limousine that comes into the city more than 30 times in a year as to the suggestion that new jersey limousine operators will have to register all their cars and drivers , he said if you 've got two neurons to rub together , you should be able to organize your dispatching in such a way that you should n't have to get all your cars licensed the genesis of the limousine controversy goes back to 1987 , when new york city passed an ordinance requiring the registration of all limousines and drivers operating in the city tourists from japan were coming in and getting hustled at the airports for a trip to manhattan for 500 bucks , mr del valle said the ordinance originally required only operators based in the city to register their vehicles and drivers but then , mr del valle said , some operators tried to be cute by registering their cars in yonkers or poughkeepsie as a result , he said , the ordinance was changed in 1988 to extend the licensing requirements to limousine operators outside new york city then all hell broke loose with operators from long island , westchester and northern new jersey , mr del valle said attempts at negotiation after five years of unsuccessful attempts at negotiation between the operators and the taxi and limousine commission , the new york legislature passed the law requiring all outoftown operators making pickups in new york city to register with the city the law requires those operators to pay a 200 registration fee for every vehicle after 1993 , the fee increases to 250
toronto there was a findesiecle gloom hanging over the 1993 world series last year the barbarians ransacked the commissioner s office this year the vandals besieged the ancient baseball tradition of championsonlyneedapply revolution by ownership and next year , who knows \? next year , you get a fivegame series , ruminated an uneasy pat gillick , the architect of the toronto blue jays , still reeking of champagne , only minutes after becoming world champions for the second straight year late saturday night next year , you could get one hot pitcher in the first round , gillick brooded he could knock you out uneasy rests the head the blue jays are champions , but next year baseball lets in wildcard teams , eight teams in all , in a playoff system for the masses next year , it all changes goodness gracious , we could have had wildcard don mattingly as world series most valuable player instead of paul molitor we could have had wildcard danny tartabull blasting the serieswinning homer in the bottom of the ninth instead of joe carter that part would have been acceptable on a human level , but think of it this way wildcard george steinbrenner could have been oozing charm from every pore for this we must be grateful , that baseball did not go ape this year knowing that the owners will cheapen their championship with a first round of obscure , quickie , regionally televised skirmishes next year , we had to work hard this year to appreciate what we had and we had some good things four champions who prevailed during the regular season how nice it was to be reminded that ozzie guillen and frank thomas are not only excellent players but also decent and talkative how come the mets get fireworkstossers and bleachsprayers and trashtalkers \? the atlanta braves went down in the national league but lost none of their appeal , with those four magnetic starters then there was the world series no wild cards allowed and discovering that the phillies , for all their grunge and bluster , reminded me of the old cardinals , the old orioles maybe because i'm an old appalachia hand , i figured out quickly that beneath the gruff west virginia pose , john kruk was a friendly bloke who never blew anybody away , even when they were asking him why he was a slob and lenny , that talented lout straight out of thurber or lardner the mets somehow overlooked dykstra s zest for smacking big hits in the 1986 postseason , and made a bizarre judgment based on character , always a risky thing in baseball three years later they traded the hardliving fireball to philly for a mope named juan samuel , and they have n't won anything since dykstra found kindred souls in philadelphia , people who do n't talk or dress or act too suavely , and he muscled a threerun homer saturday that nearly put blue jays fans in a foul anarchistic mood for elections today and finally , there are the champions gillick and his organization proved you can do it mostly right , although the jays have a huge publicrelations gaffe to repair the word escaped that cito gaston was prepared to scuttle his highly respected batting coach , larry hisle , and now the jays are in full panicretreat if they go about it right , they probably can induce hisle to stay on , which is a comment on his graciousness , not theirs otherwise , the blue jays presented an image that was an antidote for the steinbrenners and the strawberrys molitor was one of those delightful stars like brooks robinson or kirby puckett who are suddenly discovered during the world series molitor came over from milwaukee , which felt it could n't afford him , and had what even he agreed was a career year 332 in the season , 391 in the league series , 500 in the world series asked to describe his new team , molitor said genteel , which is not a word you hear much around baseball these days , but could describe paul molitor perfectly and all of north america saw his 12 postseason games , got to follow the story line then there was the man who had the last word on the 1993 season a guy named joe , who normally gets lost among the stars , just like the guy named bill who settled the 1960 series with a home run joe carter is a college man , wichita state , and a family man , with three children , whose wife , diana , stayed by his side all during the clubhouse interviews carter is such a professional that he would not let his big turn at bat be obstructed he could not see mitch williams s first pitch , coming between the second baseman and the umpire , so he asked paul runge to move slightly to his right now carter saw the lefthanded slant , and he put one over the fence , and he started jumping for joy this moment was heightened because it happened between legitimate champions who had survived long division races no wild cards among them no lucky losers we will never be able to say that again paul molitor and joe carter won the last true world series do you think the owners and the television barons understand any of this \?

the contemporary vampire has a certain charm , a je ne sais quoi that comes only from being undead think of the irresistible passion of gary oldman in francis ford coppola s recent bram stoker s 'dracula , ' or the smoothtalking manner of frank langella in the stage and screen versions of dracula from the late 1970 s even bela lugosi s classic count looked like nothing more than a 1930 s latin lover shipped to transylvania they are suave seducers , able to steal a woman s soul and body with a neat prick to the neck \( female vampires have not been so successful on screen innocent blood , with anne parillaud as the vampire who seduced pittsburgh , and buffy the vampire slayer were among last year s conspicuous flops \) vampires have not always been so appealing the first major movie dracula , and still the one most capable of producing nightmares , appears in f w murnau s 1922 silent film , nosferatu a symphony of horror as nosferatu \( or the undead \) , max schreck looks positively ratlike he has a bald head , pointy ears , elongated hands with clawlike nails and two conspicuous fangs where his front teeth should be his pastywhite coffin pallor hints at too many days out of the sun , and he walks stiffarmed and hunched over , like an animal not quite used to standing on his hind legs this guy is no cutie face he is , however , the last of the great victorian vampires and the father of all horror films nosferatu will be shown , with piano accompaniment and newly translated intertitles , today through thursday at the joseph papp public theater in one of the rarest prints available every scene of this version is tinted either sepia or blue , following murnau s instructions and the fashion of the day this early form of coloring does not improve the atmosphere \( a blue vampire is not as macabre as a blackandwhite one \) , but it has the advantage of helping us see a classic with fresh eyes the enduring power of nosferatu is more than a testament to murnau it also suggests the depth and complexity of the vampire myth , which adapts to every era and genre the diseasecarrying hero can refer to the bubonic plague or to aids his state of eternal unrest holds meaning for the religious and the godless he is often alluring and repulsive at once vampires are shape shifters , in the symbolic as well as the physical sense the myth we know so well comes from bram stoker , whose 1897 novel , dracula , was about those inexhaustible subjects , sex and death his latevictorian vampire paid for the sin of uncontrollable passion by being doomed to a state in which no peaceful afterlife was possible barely under the surface of stoker s novel is all the repressed victorian sexuality about to break free at the turn of the century and the power of science \( embodied by professor van helsing \) ready to push aside religious faith when these undercurrents are brought to the surface , they shape the sexual , faithless vampires of contemporary culture everything from the soap opera dark shadows to anne rice s bestselling series of vampire novels , to werner herzog s 1979 nosferatu the vampyre , a brilliantly updated version of the murnau film murnau s nosferatu followed bram stoker so closely that stoker s widow sued for copyright infringement murnau s screenwriter , henrik galeen , had the sense to change the names count dracula becomes count orlok jonathan harker , the clerk who is sent to transylvania to rent the count a house , is called thomas hutter his wife , mina , becomes ellen , who gives herself to the vampire one night so that he will be with her when the sun rises and so will be destroyed none of this fooled the german courts , which ruled in favor of mrs stoker , stopped screenings of the film and ordered that all prints and negatives be destroyed of course they were n't , but what remained were pirated and reedited prints there are probably as many bastardized versions of nosferatu as there are of james joyce s ulysses the nosferatu at the public is 84 minutes long \( a blip by today s movie standards \) , but even so it takes quite a while for hutter to make his way from his blissful honeymoon

only days after the bonn parliament yielded to pressure from the right by scrapping germany s liberal asylum laws , extremists stepped up their campaign against foreigners five turkish women and children died in a firebombing ascribed to neonazi skinheads the solingen tragedy , the worst of its kind since unification in 1990 , ignited violent demonstrations by turkish immigrants yet chancellor helmut kohl s generalized condemnation of all violence does not begin to deal with the valid grievances of a vulnerable minority germany s 15 million or so turkish inhabitants are not asylumseekers fleeing persecution at home nearly all are guest workers , or the offspring of guest workers , whose toil has been an essential element in germany s economic miracle however , few are citizens , hardly any are civil servants and none sit in the national parliament this is due to germany s highly restrictive naturalization laws , based on a principle of ethnicity adopted long ago when the kaisers reigned any migrant who can prove ethnic german ancestry can be readily granted citizenship but a permanent turkish resident , though born in germany and fluent in its language , can be refused citizenship unless he or she renounces turkish nationality as a result , only 13 , 000 turks met citizenship requirements between 1977 and 1990 the simplest relief would be to permit dual citizenship , as other countries do some members of chancellor kohl s centerright coalition seem ready to follow this course , but officials fear doing anything that might reward rampaging turkish demonstrators that objection rings hollow , since germany has already rewarded the incomparably more savage violence of neonazis by scrapping europe s most liberal asylum laws meanwhile , turkey s president and prime minister have appeared daily on german television , urging turkish citizens in germany to abjure violence this contrasts with chancellor kohl s conspicuous absence at a memorial service in cologne for the five turkish women and children president richard von weizsacker did better the terror attacks , he told a grieving audience there , are not unrelated or isolated atrocities but results of a climate created by the extreme right that mr kohl failed to reinforce the president s condemnation only underscores a plaintive reality germany s turks ca n't vote their tormentors can
the mergers and acquisitions business is booming again , with a flurry of recent deals whose size recalls the heady days of the 1980 s more than 142 billion worth of deals has been announced thus far this year , and while that is far short of the record 264 billion of 1988 , the pace is picking up in the last week alone , at least eight deals of more than 100 million were announced in addition to a proposed whopping 82 billion merger of viacom and paramount because many wall street professionals are also helping companies spin off unwanted businesses to shareholders , and are handling the record number of new stock offerings , many financiers say they are as busy as they were in the 1980 s ah , but there is a twist unlike the 1980 s , when corporate predators were lionized and the dealmaking frenzy caught the eye of hollywood filmmakers , today s m a business is more staid and some would say more sensible that is precisely why so many wall street professionals expect the activity begun of late to last if the grand strategies outlined in such recently proposed mergers as at t s 126 billion agreement with mccaw cellular communications , merck s 6 billion merger plan with medco and the 8 billion agreement between viacom and paramount are realized , wall street s financiers can claim to be doing well , not just doing deals the deals now are much more likely to be motivated by strategic reasons rather than just finance , said jeffrey r sechrest , the managing director for mergers and acquisitions at lehman brothers with little growth in the economy , he added , companies that have already cut costs dramatically and improved their profitability are looking for new ways to grow , and deciding that the best approach is to acquire other companies in the same line of business peter j solomon , head of an invsetment banking firm of the same name , noted that in many cases the strategy is being driven by goals loftier than simply trying to boost next quarter s earnings a marriage of at t and mccaw , for instance , would create a communications powerhouse that should be better able to adapt to whatever technologies win the slugfest in the communications business industry in the healthcare field , mr solomon said , mergers like that of merck , a drug maker , with medco , a wholesale drug distributor , will do more to reduce expenses and make that industry more efficient than anything that congress could ever do by legislation he said he expects that the consolidation in the pharmaceutical business will , in turn , be matched by mergers of hospitals and other health care providers besides craving the economic power that comes with size , companies are realizing that they are free to pursue ambitious deals now that they have swept away the debt that once cluttered their balance sheets companies see their stock price is relatively high , their balance sheet is cleaned up and cash flow is good , said jack levy , cohead of the mergers and acquisitions group at merrill lynch and it makes them feel confident and ready to reach for more there is a desire to focus on core businesses and achieve scale it s not just big for bigness' sake , he added they want to get more leverage out of a distribution system , spread their fixed costs over a larger revenue base , or increase market share thus far , none of the recent megamergers has been stopped cold by the antitrust cops in washington but there are lingering concerns about some deals , including the proposed merger of at t , which dominates longdistance phone service , with mccaw , the largest company in the cellular phone business mccaw provides local phone service of the kind at t was forced to leave a decade ago on another front , the federal trade commission asked merck and medco to provide more information about their proposed merger last week for companies willing and able to take the plunge , the environment could not be more friendly whatever means of financing acquirers are hoping to use , john zacamy , a managing director at bankers trust , said , there is right now a high degree of certainty that deals will be successful with the stock market near a record high , sellers command high prices , but buyers can pay by issuing new , highly priced shares and to the limited extent that debt is used , interest rates are lower than they ever were in the 1980 s although lenders' credit standards remain tougher than in the 1980 s , banks are currently more willing to lend than they have been in recent years , and investors are absorbing record amounts of junk bonds even though the debt is cheap , companies are still doing their best to avoid accumulating such a burden in contrast , in the 1980 s many deals were mere financial exercises acquirers borrowed vast sums to buy companies , which were then dismembered or flogged to death to repay their debt for example , viacom s 81 billion merger agreement with paramount calls for just 109 billion of cash for paramount shareholders , a far cry from 1989 , when paramount unsuccessfully tried to scuttle the time warner merger by dangling a 12 billion allcash counteroffer in front of time inc s investors while the 1980 s taught many corporations to do more with less , wall street has not been lax in learning the same lesson even though merger and acquisition activity is increasing , the number of professionals devoted to the activity remains as much as 50 percent below the peak levels of the late 1980 s at many brokerage firms , banks and law firms some firms , such as bankers trust , have folded their m a group into their corporate finance department , and those that have n't say their m a staff is expected to be much more involved in other financial transactions than they were before at merrill lynch , for instance , the 80person m a group is about half its former size , mr levy said , and it has changed the way it operates no longer seen as specialists who leave the scene the moment a deal is consummated , his group now makes an effort to hold its client s hand as long as necessary relationships now are generating transactions , mr levy said fear , of course , still plays an important role in motivating mergers and acquisitions , but for different reasons than in the 1980 s the raiders who once began hostile takeover bids against a management s wishes are gone , but now the fear is of dissatisfied shareholders and that is keeping corporate managers alert and looking harder at opportunities to improve their company , mr zacamy of bankers trust said even the ambiance in the meeting rooms where merger details are hammered out has undergone a profound change we used to have a litigator attached to virtually every m a team and always in cases of hostile deals , said benjamin stapleton , a partner at sullivan cromwell , the new york law firm now , with so many deals occurring between consenting partners , there is little need to call in highpriced litigators to disrupt opponents' plans there is also more time to investigate the business being acquired , paying particular attention to potential liability for environmental damages or faulty products the hostile takeovers of the 1980 s were tailormade for images of warfare , something that everybody understands , said arthur fleischer , a partner at the law firm fried , frank , harris , shriver jacobson in his view , bidding wars , poison pills and white knights could all make a comeback someday he said that for now , however , things are being done in a much less dramatic way photo

johannesburg maybe one day hollywood will make a movie set in south africa that features some of the following an afrikaner leader who repudiates apartheid an upwardly mobile black entrepreneur the tinpot dictator of a designated black homeland a migrant worker torn between his tribal upbringing and the citified ways of the township the powerhungry wife of a black liberation leader maybe , that is , hollywood will make a movie populated with characters and textured with dilemmas south africans themselves , black and white , would recognize but for hollywood , and perhaps for most americans , south africa is not a real place it is a parable , in which ruthless white evil battles unmitigated black decency adolf hitler versus the cosby family is the way peter wilhelm , a critic for the weekly financial mail , sums up hollywood s portrayal of his country in a half dozen films that have appeared since mainstream directors discovered the dramatic potential of apartheid the mid1980 s bopha ! , the directorial debut of the actor morgan freeman , is the latest hollywood reflection on apartheid , and it pushes earnestly at the boundaries of south african stereotypes in the film , based on percy mtwa s 1984 play about a black policeman and his rebellious son , the cosby family is now dysfunctional there is also a benign afrikaner cop , though he knuckles under to the nazi caricatures among his colleagues but like most of its predecessors , bopha ! is set on the barricades between good and evil whatever its merits may be as film \( american reviewers have generally praised it since its opening late last month , while south africans will not see it until next year \) , its south africa is still more metaphor than country south africa is hardly the only victim of hollywood s tendency to see life in one easy dimension , but many south africans say apartheid seems to satisfy a particular moral hunger among americans a yearning for those clear choices on issues of race that america itself has not offered since the height of the civil rights movement the complaint is not that hollywood exaggerates the cruelty and humiliation of apartheid , which would be difficult to do , but that the movies are filled with glib judgments and the political statement usually overwhelms the story and the characters blacks in these films , many south africans complain , are as much cliches as whites either the black protagonist is an activist devoted to the struggle or a goalonggetalong fellow who , before the film is over , will discover the error of his indifference often blacks are relegated to bit parts in their own struggle richard attenborough s 1987 movie cry freedom is an example much maligned here the movie starred denzel washington as steve biko , the black nationalist leader battered to death in police custody , and kevin kline as donald woods , the white journalist who befriended mr biko and investigated his death cry freedom was faulted by south africans because mr biko is killed off in midmovie , whereupon it becomes a conventional escape melodrama starring the white reporter \( denzel washington s oscar nomination was for best supporting actor \) there s got to be a white savior in the film , said jerry mofokeng , a theater director and drama teacher at the university of the witswatersrand steven biko cannot be seen in his own light mr mofokeng said it was symptomatic of foreign film makers' attitudes that an american star was cast in the biko role rather than one of this country s accomplished black actors our struggle is good business , but we cannot get bread out of it , he said we are only the symbols another objection to cry freedom was that it homogenized black resistance into a single movement by having mr biko pay homage to nelson mandela mr biko did admire mr mandela , but mr biko s black consciousness movement represented a sharp break from the nonracial doctrine of mr mandela s african national congress , and these starkly different philosophies divide blacks to this day to many south africans , fuzzing over the distinction was like equating martin luther king and malcolm x a more egregious example of the whitecentered south africa movie was the power of one , a 1992 film about a white boy who endures the pain of discrimination because he speaks english rather than afrikaans stirred by his own experience , the blond boy takes up boxing and becomes the symbolic avenger , battling the evil afrikaners while helpless , worshipful blacks look on it s a celebration of colonialism , said william pretorius , who writes for the weekly mail and guardian under the pseudonym fabius burger the whole idea is that the black does n't think for himself , that it takes a white boy to teach him to think the one american movie many south africans point to as accurately capturing their experiences is a world apart , the 1987 film based on the experiences of shawn slovo , the daughter of prominent communists consumed by the antiapartheid movement although the film focuses on a white family , it is filled with robust characters of both races and authentic relationships , including the anguished one between the teenage daughter \( jodhi may \) and the mother \( barbara hershey \) who puts struggle before family
east rutherford , nj , dec 12 if the giants players have learned anything from their coach , dan reeves and they appear to have learned plenty it is that professionalism counts coats and ties over flash and dash so it was no surprise that in the locker room after the giants dominated indianapolis today there was no celebrating when the team learned it had made the playoffs just a calm group looking forward to the next opponent no champagne no hugs this afternoon s 206 victory over the colts before 70 , 411 at giants stadium did n't just give the giants a 103 record and a playoff spot it ended a twoyear drought of inept football and reestablished the team as one of the better organizations in the sport it also firmly established reeves as the main reason for the turnaround we all knew that if we won today , we 'd have a chance to get in the playoffs , said quarterback phil simms it has been a couple of years and i'm excited about it and i know everyone else is we 've got so many young guys who have never been in it and we 're all looking forward to that they 're excited , but not joyous confident , but not bigheaded no one seems to be satisfied with just making the playoffs for the first time since the 1990 super bowl season homefield advantage is next goal the giants , thanks in part to good , solid play all year , thanks in part to so many of their competitors falling apart and clearing a path for them , control their own destiny in the national football conference their record is the best in the nfc if they win their remaining three games , at new orleans , at phoenix and at home against dallas , they will insure themselves the homefield advantage throughout the playoffs you 've got to get there first , said reeves of the playoffs now , we 're trying to fight for home field this is an awfully good place to play this time of year he says good , because when it s cold and the wind is swarming the way it does this time of year , giants stadium is not kind to quarterbacks , especially opposing ones passing teams , like the colts , have a tougher time at giants stadium than running teams , like the giants and boy , are the giants a running team running back rodney hampton rushed for a careerhigh 173 yards on 33 attempts and scored one touchdown , from a yard out the touchdown concluded a gameopening , 70yard , nineplay drive in which hampton carried the ball five times basically , the giants , who rushed for 205 yards today , manhandled the colts from the start ranked 28th in the league against the run , the colts tried to recover from the giants' opening drive , but never really did we like to run the ball , no question , hampton said of a team that is ranked first in the league in rushing if we go out and run , good things can happen in fact , the giants are 91 when hampton rushes for more than 100 yards simms threw just 15 passes for 85 yards \( his lowest completegame total since 1986 \) and one touchdown , but the giants did n't need him to throw very much all the giants did was hitch their caboose to hampton and let him pull them all the way home none of his carries were long runs \( his longest was 18 yards \) , but when 230plus pounds is coming at you fast , 18 yards begins to look like 1 , 000 just ask safety ray buchanan , who hampton flatout ran over in the first quarter and as soon as the colts began trying to cope with hampton , they became vulnerable to mediumrange , crisp passes from simms one of those passes went for 17 yards to chris calloway for a touchdown that put the giants up , 130 \( the extra point was botched \) the colts , who knocked off the jets in giants stadium a week ago , did put up a fight today quarterback jeff george has one of the strongest arms in the league , but his maturity still has a way to go his teammates still do n't respect him as a result of his long holdout earlier in the season alone and losing one time i looked to the sidelines and he was standing there by himself , said giants cornerback mark collins , who missed several plays because of an eye injury , but later returned you ca n't have team unity when your franchise quarterback is a loner george had a good game , completing 22 of 38 passes for 254 yards but the key statistic was zero touchdowns , making it 17 quarters since the last time indianapolis scored one in all , the colts managed just two field goals , of 21 and 26 yards the giants' defense played well despite the absence of its star linebacker , michael brooks , who is out with a severely sprained foot andre powell took his place , but he suffered a separated right shoulder and had to leave the game in the first half but the way things have been going this year , whoever the giants plug in manages to work out when powell left the game , outside linebacker marcus buckley moved inside and had three tackles the game was put out of reach early in the fourth quarter when fullback jarrod bunch , who played a big part in opening up those huge holes for hampton , scored a 2yard touchdown to give the giants a 206 lead that stood up as the final score now , the giants will continue their quest for a division title and respect respect has now become the rallying cry for the team whether it is a real or imagined phenomenon the wedo n'tgetrespect theme is working no one gave us credit in 1990 and the same thing is happening now , said collins there are some similarities it s kind of spooky but i like it extra points injured giants receiver mike sherrard was on the sideline during the game , as he has been games only this time was different he was off crutches sherrard seems to be recovering well from his fractured hip andre powell said xrays showed no severe damage in the shoulder he injured sunday and he thinks he could be ready by next week more on injuries offensive guard william roberts sprained his left knee and left the game for several plays before returning while he was out , clarence jones went in at tackle and eric moore , in for the injured jumbo elliott , went to guard after the game , roberts said he was fine players from the memorable 1958 championship game between the giants and colts were

phnom penh , cambodia , may 23 more than 15 million cambodians defied khmer rouge threats of violence today to vote in this nation s first multiparty election in two decades , a vote that many cambodians hope will end a generation of tyranny and unrelenting carnage united nations peacekeepers , who had predicted that the khmer rouge rebels would try to sabotage the sixday election by attacking polling stations , were relieved to report that there had been only a few instances of violence on the first day of voting , none of them resulting in deaths it is a lucky time for the people of cambodia , said 70yearold pot pon , a revered senior buddhist monk in the northwestern province of siem reap , where the maoist guerrillas of the khmer rouge have a large and often violent presence monk is first to vote a crowd of more than 500 eager voters who had jammed a polling station in the provincial capital made way early this morning for the aging saffronrobed monk to grant him the honor of being the first to vote today it is a time for the people of cambodia to have their human rights , he said the united nations peacekeeping force in cambodia said its preliminary tallies showed that at least 15 million , or about onethird of the 47 million registered voters , had turned out to cast ballots in the central province of kompong cham , a khmer rouge stronghold where two chinese peacekeeping soldiers were killed in a rocket attack saturday for which the guerrillas were blamed , voters crowded into united nationssupervised polling sites so insistent were they on having their chance to vote that peacekeepers had to use all their strength to hold back the surging crowd it does n't ease up they keep pushing the door , said elaine douglasnoel , a united nations electoral monitor from jamaica , who accepted the assignment in kompong cham despite warnings of its danger we had to post a police officer to hold them back this is how much they want democracy final results from the election are not expected to be announced until the first week of june united nations officials and many cambodians say it it is likely to come down to a race between the governing cambodian people s party and the royalist opposition party founded by the nation s former monarch , prince norodom sihanouk turnout 'very gratifying' the khmer rouge , who were responsible for the deaths of more than one million cambodians when they controlled the central government in the 1970 s , had threatened to use violence to disrupt the elections they fear a decisive victory by the cambodian people s party , the political wing of the current , vietnamesebacked government , which they have been fighting since 1979 if the ruling party wins , the government is expected to expand the war against the khmer rouge to try to destroy the rebel group once and for all yasushi akashi , the japanese diplomat who leads the 22 , 000member united nations peacekeeping force , said today that throughout the countryside the turnout has been very , very gratifying he said that the attacks reported on polling stations were nothing very serious in one attack , scores of uniformed gunmen identified as khmer rouge soldiers were reported to have surrounded a polling site in the southern province of kampot before voting began several united nations peacekeepers and cambodian electoral workers were held for nearly an hour before they were released unharmed in the western border city of poipet , three mortar rounds landed near the city s only polling station one hour after it opened today , slightly wounding two cambodians 'khmer rouge have failed' the senior american diplomat in cambodia , charles twining , said that the generally peaceful voting proved that the khmer rouge have failed i'm absolutely convinced that technically , this election is being conducted in a manner that is free and fair , mr twining said as he watched voters line up in the morning drizzle to cast ballots in a polling station in the central sports stadium in phnom penh , known grandly as the olympic stadium this leaves the khmer rouge in the forest and i hope they like it there along the stadium s dank halls and on its central basketball court , cambodian electoral workers set up dozens of white cardboard voting booths and long wooden tables voters stopped at the tables to have their laminated voter registration cards checked , and each dipped a finger in a cup of invisible ink , a precaution against cheating the ink shows up under the ultraviolet flashlights that have been distributed to the nearly 1 , 400 united nations polling stations across cambodia the stadium was ringed by heavily armed united nations peacekeeping troops , including sikhs from india who wore blue turbans in place of the traditional united nations blue berets i thought that the voting would be much more violent , a senior asian diplomat said in phnom penh the khmer rouge may have felt they were simply outgunned at present by the un forces and the cambodian army or perhaps they felt that funcinpec will win the election , and that they have a chance of obtaining power in the new government funcinpec is the french acronym for the national united front for an independent , neutral , peaceful and cooperative cambodia the party created by prince sihanouk and now led by his eldest son , prince norodom ranariddh prince sihanouk has said he is neutral on the elections , in which voters are selecting a 120member constitutional convention party officials say that if funcinpec wins , prince ranariddh will ask his father to form a coalition government that might include the khmer rouge despite the rebels' brutal past , the party officials say , the khmer rouge might be offered a role in the government if they agreed to put down their arms and end cambodia s 14yearold civil war united nations election officials stationed throughout cambodia said today that they had been heartened by the eagerness of cambodians to vote , despite the threat of guerrilla violence and the long distances that voters had to travel for the chance to cast a ballot long wait disregarded we had people wait for three , four hours this morning to vote , and no one complained , said janarhan baral , a 29yearold election worker from bangladesh who supervised a polling station in the tiny village of rolous , about 45 miles southwest of phnom penh in the province of kompong speu i know these people they want to vote they feel they need to vote hundreds of cambodians made their way to rolous today from the town of new oaral , several miles south , where voting became impossible after the khmer rouge used grenades to destroy the local united nations peacekeeping office this month when the khmer rouge were attacking , i was so frightened that i was shaking , said theuk pha , 70 , a widowed farmer from new oaral , who voted today for the first time in her life when the khmer rouge marched down the street , i had to implore them not to burn down my house , she said i am still frightened now sometimes i was even frightened today when i went to vote but after i voted , it felt very good i felt powerful photo threats of violence by the khmer rouge failed to deter thousands of cambodians from flocking to polling stations yesterday at the start of their country s first elections in over 20 years at a major station in phnom penh , the capital , voters waved their united nations registration cards \( reuters \) \( pg a6 \) map of cambodia showing location of kompong

dr bruce h yaffe relishes his life in new york and delights in being a doctor he regularly treats patients to evenings of offbroadway theater and holds monthly discussion groups at his home to debate politics and art but dr yaffe , who practices internal medicine and gastroenterology in manhattan , is ever more worried that the type of medicine he loves is slipping away everything s changing , he said , during a long afternoon talk about the future of medicine i think of myself as a forwardthinking person , but i'm worried that some things are changing not for the better but just for the sake of change fear and betrayal dr yaffe is not the only new york city doctor who fears the future and feels betrayed by a profession that has changed since he dedicated his life to it as the clinton administration finalizes its proposals for overhauling the healthcare system , doctors across the country are waiting anxiously to learn how the changes will alter their lives the tension is particularly high in new york while the details are not yet clear , the clinton plan will almost certainly accelerate an existing trend toward more health maintenance organizations , in which patients receive all care from a group of physicians for a preset fee , or looser managedcare networks in which patients select doctors from an insurance company list for their part , involved doctors usually either work on salary or for negotiated fees dr yaffe has experienced some of the facets of managed care and already they are beginning to have an impact on his practice while he normally charges 90 for an office visit , he said , managedcare plans seldom provide more than 50 and , he said , if all of his patients were in managed care , his income would fall dramatically less autonomy but some of his concerns are less concrete he worries about intrusions into his professional autonomy , including restrictions on which specialists he can refer his patients to , and he wonders whether in the emerging medical system , he can preserve the close relationships with patients that he finds so satisfying in many parts of the country , healthcare networks have been common for years in san francisco , 42 percent of the people who have health insurance belong to an hmo but new york doctors and consumers have been particularly reluctant to join the trend only 11 percent of insured new yorkers belong to hmo s , and , to an unusual degree , doctors in new york have been able to preserve oldfashioned independent practices as a result , doctors' fears about the future about their professional autonomy , their ability to build lasting ties with patients and their potential incomes may run deeper here than in much of the country years of training in many ways dr yaffe is a very unusual doctor even for new york a point made just by walking into his eclectically cluttered office , where lifesized , foamstuffed people sit on the couches in the waiting room but in his anxiety over the future and his nostalgia for the past , dr yaffe is typical of the city in which he lives when dr yaffe graduated from george washington university school of medicine in 1976 , competition for admission was fierce fewer than one student in three was accepted to an american medical school many of those who were rejected chose to go to foreign schools instead after medical school , dr yaffe completed a threeyear residency in internal medicine at the mount sinai medical center he stayed on for a oneyear fellowship in liver disease , then moved to lenox hill hospital for a twoyear fellowship in gastroenterology , or problems of the digestive tract during those years he earned an average of 25 , 000 a year the extra years of training meant that dr yaffe , as is true of most

account for the fact that their peers in other professions have been in the workplace for a decade before most doctors even get to the starting block it s a big burden to face at age 32 , said dr

westhampton beach , li , feb 25 warning that long island s fragile ecology and touristdependent economy are at risk , political and business leaders called today for a joint federal and state effort to help repair the coastal damage from this winter s stormy weather staging a media blitz to draw attention to the devastation , the nassau and suffolk county executives , thomas s gulotta and robert j gaffney , led reporters and photographers on a twoandahalfhour helicopter tour of the south shore from jones beach , where sand was being trucked in to rebuild the dunes , to westhampton beach , where a new inlet , created by a northeaster in december , is now nearly half a mile wide and growing we are concerned that what has happened since december has brought the island s ecosystem and economy into genuine crisis , said james l larocca , president of the long island association , the region s largest business and civic group he said federal and state help were essential to help preserve the entire island s 1 , 180 miles of coastline we need all levels of government working together on this , said mr larocca , who arranged the aerial news conference some things unmentioned none of the officials on this morning s tour would hazard a guess as to how much beach repairs would cost or who would pay they all acknowledged , however , that budgets were tight from the federal government all the way down to the village level this cost factor has added to growing pressure from many environmentalists to let nature take its course and swallow beaches and summer homes and even though it may involve losing some of the most expensive real estate in the world , as is the case in the hamptons , many argue that the expense of fighting the effects of storms and a rising sea level is far too great they also argue that it would be unfair to taxpayers to spend so much to benefit so few mr gulotta appeared to take a middle road in the debate mother nature has blessed us with some of the most precious natural resources in the world , he said and it s our responsibility as a society to insure that we preserve her gifts but we must not fight mother nature in doing so , but work with her one thing was indisputable the damage done by the storms scores of homes that only three months ago sat safely behind dunes at westhampton beach , hundreds of feet from the water s edge , now teeter atop pilings in the surf , slowly breaking apart scores of other homes have already been washed into the sea the top half of one home sat in shallow water just inside moriches bay , waves washing though the open windows and out the back door at the widening inlet at westhampton beach , more than 30 homes have disappeared along with dune road , which linked the rest of the narrow barrier beach with its nearly 300 homes to the mainland mr gaffney said it may take the army corps of engineers until may to decide whether it will reclose the inlet local town officials have already said they ca n't afford to do it alone the atlantic now flows heavily through the inlet into moriches bay , threatening to change the salinity of the bay and expose its prized shellfish beds to an invasion of starfish from the ocean , mr gaffney said nature , and dredges , at work while the natural rebuilding of the beaches has begun from coney island to montauk , the gradual effort will take decades to replace what was lost in december however , dredging equipment was at work today at gilgo beach and jones beach , where the helicopter was set down some 400 , 000 cubic yards of sand deposited on the north shore of the island during the last ice age has been trucked from a quarry in broad hollow and dumped to form dunes at jones beach , whose reserves were depleted by the december storm airborne in a bright morning sun , the helicopter s shadow traced the receding shoreline of fire island , where more beach houses have been claimed by the sea where jetties had been built to slow the natural drift of sand from east to west , the beach extended briefly outward but then receded sharply immediately to the west of the last jetty such was the case at westhampton beach , where environmentalists argue that a scouring action created by the jetties bore through the barrier beach , helping to create the inlet if we 're going to build jetties and i'm not suggesting that s the solution , we 'll have to start at coney island and work east all the way to montauk , said mr larocca you have to think of how each action at any one location effects the entire island , and that includes the north shore as well the effort to save the island s beaches is to be discussed at the long island coastal conference june 16 and 17 in uniondale and at jones beach it is sponsored by the long island association with the support of both nassau and suffolk counties and the state office of parks , recreation and historic preservation photo concerned about long island s ecosystem as well as its economy , political and business leaders sent out a call yesterday for help in repairing its embattled coastline on westhampton beach , a recent storm has carved out an inlet that is continuing to grow as the beach recedes \( vic delucia the new york times \)
cortlandt , ny the hills around here are the backwoods of westchester county , a place where the trim suburban streets seem to thin out and a terrain emerges that is closer to the rawness of the adirondacks it is here that the county government 31 years ago chose to locate a public firing range that defies the genteel golf and tennis image the nation has of westchester over the years , hunters and shooting enthusiasts have pierced countless bull seyes and shattered innumerable clay pigeons , and their spent ammunition has dropped a mother lode of lead in the moist black soil of the range that lead 500 tons by some estimates has now been called a danger to the health of children and wildlife by federal and state authorities , and it has become the center of a local dispute that is echoed in many of the 8 , 000 recreational ranges elsewhere in the nation not so far from cortlandt , the rodman s neck range in the bronx and the former remington arms range in stratford , conn , have also come under official or judicial scrutiny because of the lead that shooting enthusiasts leave behind tradition of shooting here , in this town near peekskill , the debate has pitted parents with no particular affection for the sport , including many of the newer commuting families , against the older rural families who have a tradition of hunting and shooting and it has pitted environmentalists , who look out for the hudson river s nurturing wetlands , against the government officials in the county seat 15 miles to the south in white plains the environmentalists contend that the lead is seeping into the groundwater , ponds and marshes that feed the animal life of the blue mountain reservation , a 1 , 500acre county preserve of hardwoods and hemlocks that encloses the 300acre range , known officially as the sportsman center more ominously , they say , substantial quantities of lead have been found in the sediment of a stream a halfmile from the range and next to an elementary school schoolchildren sometimes play in the stream , hunting for tadpoles i find it appalling that the enjoyment of sportsmen outweighs the health of young children , joan ann mazza , the president of the furnace woods school parents association , said in a letter to andrew p o'rourke , the county executive damage from lead a suit brought by sean heverin , a onetime shooting enthusiast who is in a custody fight with his wife , lisa , the range s cashier , contends that his two daughters now have double the normal levels of lead in their bloodstreams because they lived for a time in an apartment used by range employees lead causes brain and other neurological damage and can diminish iq s but county officials maintain that the children acquired the lead from toy animals and while the county has not conducted testing , no student at the school has been found to have elevated levels of lead by a personal pediatrician the county s parks and health commissioners also argue that the perils have been exaggerated , and that none of the lead poses an imminent danger to either wildlife or human beings still , the county was ordered in december by the federal environmental protection agency to come up with a plan to remove the lead , and it hired a consultant to recommend ways to do so without further disturbing the area s ecology last week the consultant confirmed that there were high levels of lead on the site the consultant said removing the lead would probably cost taxpayers more than 2 million there is a potential problem and the county recognizes that and is moving forward to remove the lead , said dr mark s rapoport , the county s health commissioner the question is whether there is an imminent danger concerns about cost in an area with a deep fondness for guns and hunting , no one is calling for the range to be shut down but one unspoken concern is that the eventual cost of removing lead on a systematic basis will make the price of sustaining the range prohibitive operating the range now costs the county 125 , 000 a year if we close that center , people will be hunting in the reservation , warned clare palermo flower , mr o'rourke s spokeswoman the dispute has been given added luster by the presence of robert f kennedy jr , the nephew of the late president and a professor at pace university in white plains who specializes in environmental law he represents cortlandt watch , an association of homeowners , and the hudson riverkeeper s fund , an environmental group , in a suit against the county filed last july in federal district court that contends that the lead violates the clean water act and other federal statutes you do n't leave this stuff on the ground for 50 years , mr kennedy said we now know that even infinitesimal levels of lead exposure cause permanent retardation in children the dispute also threatens to become a local campaign issue since mr o'rourke , the county executive , is expected to run for reelection and one challenger is likely to be assemblyman richard l brodsky , the new head of the assembly environmental committee the county has been dragging its feet for years , mr brodsky said of the lead on the range they know this may set a national precedent for handling this kind of place pellets on the ground the range , hidden in dense woods , opened in 1962 and draws more than 200 shooters on a weekend day it is actually several ranges for largebore rifles , smallbore rifles , pistols , and trap and skeet the ground of the trap and skeet range , where the frisbeelike orange clay pigeons are catapulted into the air as a speeding target for shotgun shooters , is covered with lead pellets that look like caviar over time , the lead crumbles in contact with the soil an investigation by the state s department of environmental conservation last spring concluded that the level of lead in some of the soil was extremely high and posed a threat to humans or wildlife the federal environmental protection agency also directed the county to warn parents of the presence of lead near the school , which the county did by letter on jan 25 mr rapoport says that since the lead is confined to the muddy bed of the stream , the danger to schoolchildren is , for the moment , remote if a child were to crawl into the stream and take a handful of sediment and put it into his mouth , that would be a problem , he said but parents say that scenario may not be so farfetched how many kids do you know of that play in the water before lunch and then wash their hands before they eat \? said mrs mazza , the mother of three photo a firing range in cortlandt , ny , has left , by some estimates , 500 tons of lead federal and state authorities say it is a danger to health of children and wildlife assemblyman richard l brodsky , head of the assembly environmental committee , looked through the skeet range for lead pellets \( dan cronin for the new york times \) map shows the location

phoenix , may 23 a 50inch television set that is more rectangular than charles barkley is the centerpiece of the phoenix suns clubhouse it has a satellite feed , capacity for 500 channels , speakers that rattle the room and is intermittently tuned in to the knicks players pass the basketball more than they pass the remote control , and early last week , guard negele knight was flipping channels furiously with two thumbs suddenly , upon seeing the knick city dancers on mtv , he slammed on its brakes you might see them in person in a couple weeks , a lockerroom visitor advised knight , who was fixed in a trance i better turn this off , knight said no flipping ahead the suns do not want to get ahead of themselves they have been on collision course with the knicks ever since greg anthony did his pro wrestling imitation on kevin johnson in march , but the seattle supersonics are tall , longarmed , hotheaded and next in line for phoenix , beginning monday night in the western conference finals i 'd rather play the mavericks , barkley said today the sonics have also been on a collision course with themselves they are eight interchangeable , streakshooting parts , except only five of them can play at a time coach george karl has had bimonthly arguments with guard gary payton and forwards derrick mckey and shawn kemp , all of whom tap him on the shoulder for more playing time but the team ultimately vents its frustration on opponents ah , i think this is stuff that goes on with every team the difference is we talk about it , karl said tonight everybody else keeps it quiet no , we do n't hang together off the floor , but we hang together on the floor a roar among the trees barkley makes sure all the suns like one another or else he screams at them a 6foot4 1 2inch heman , he entered the playoffs with nervous energy and tried too hard for his own good in the first round , the lakers surrounded him with all the 611 trees they could find and pushed the suns to five perilous games since then , barkley has decided to return to his regularseason routine , 18 daily holes of golf , which has loosened him up again in the second round , he won the series with a jump shot over one of the league s ultimate redwoods , david robinson i like golf because i can get away by myself for once , barkley said seattle , on the other hand , has more tall , angular players than either the spurs or lakers and they even have jerry west , the lakers' general manager , to thank for sam perkins the february trade of perkins to seattle for rookie doug christie and nonfactor benoit benjamin gave the sonics more headiness , more rebounding , more serenity and someone to guard barkley perkins , acclaimed for his rubberband arms , likely will start monday s game on barkley and will attempt to push him outside kemp , who might be able to beat barkley in armwrestling , would normally be the perfect one to handle barkley s roughhousing , but karl wants to save kemp from foul trouble and will start him on phoenix s centers eventually , though , perkins , kemp and mckey will all take turns with phoenix s wide one we 've got to keep them off the offensive boards , barkley said anything else will be bogus ricky pierce takes most of the heartstopping shots , and , for instance , forced saturday s overtime with houston but eddie johnson , a 10year veteran , is a former sun who used to calm the locker room in phoenix and now patrols seattle s pins and points the suns \? barkley s the man , said johnson , who hinted the sonics might not want to run with the suns but the key to that team is dan majerle he s the one with pins in his ankles and hurting all the time , but they feed off of him it was majerle s outside shooting that pained the suns in the first two playoff series , a cool 38 percent instead , their savior was none other than rookie oliver miller , who rejuvenated himself with a midseason diet and is phoenix s answer to perkins miller also keeps them jovial before a recent playoff game , an arizona donut shop delivered six dozen cream donuts to the team , and cedric ceballos stuck them all in miller s locker as a joke so , every day , the team is either glued to that 50inch television or picking on miller on saturday , in fact , they all watched seattle s seventhgame overtime victory with the sound turned up , all the while hoping that the overtime would wear the sonics out listen , barkley said i do n't think i 'll let my team lose this year
at 10 30 one recent morning , after a 40minute drive from her family farm in hunterdon county , christine todd whitman called a meeting of her campaign staff in the people for whitman headquarters in a modern office building in clark this is clearly a wonderful story , ms whitman said , holding up a newspaper article in which a public opinion poll had been interpreted as showing tepid support for the reelection of gov jim florio we can use it to feel good , get excited , and to confirm what we 've been hearing out on the street but we ca n't let it go to our heads things have n't gotten nearly as hot as they 're going to get the campaign workers , a relaxed group of freshfaced 20somethings , many in denim jeans and sweaters , nodded their agreement and sipped their diet cokes ms whitman formal and aristocratic , wearing a cobalt blue suit proceeded to the next item on her agenda so began another day in the campaign of the 46yearold woman who , some political experts say , represents the republican party s best hope for unseating mr florio in this november s gubernatorial election her first political hurdle , though , is the june 8 primary , which pits her against three fellow republicans patrick gilligan , a morris county businessman james wallwork , a former state senator , and cary edwards , the state s former attorney general in the course of a ninehour working day , ms whitman spoke to meetings of republican women , teachers , business people and a newspaper editorial board and referred to her republican rivals hardly at all her time was spent attacking the policies and political philosophy of governor florio in an interview during the day , ms whitman returned to her theme that a november campaign would be hardfought , particularly since the democratic state committee has hired james carville , president clinton s chief campaign strategist last year , as a campaign consultant mr carville and mr florio are street fighters , she said , and james carville s mo is to put the opponent on the defensive early on after an 11 o'clock session in her private office with state senator c louis bassano , the union republican who is chairman of the senate health and human services committee and who briefed her on a variety of healthrelated issues , ms whitman set out for her first appearance of the day , a luncheon of the essex county republican women in west orange along the way , seated in her leased 1992 mercury sable , ms whitman said that on a typical day she traveled about 200 miles she recalled her losing 1990 race against united states senator bill bradley , her first statewide campaign we would have to drum up events , she said nobody really cared that we were out there if i saw two people on the street corner , i would stop to talk now , she said , we are in a position of constantly turning down events though born into a prominent republican family both parents served the party in various state and county positions ms whitman herself has held just one elected office , that of a somerset county freeholder from 1983 to 1988 she then spent two years as president of the state board of public utilities it was the campaign against senator bradley that catapulted her into her present prominence though he was widely considered unbeatable and outspent ms whitman by a ratio of 12 to 1 , she received 49 percent of the vote some political experts say that ms whitman s surprising showing was attributable to voter backlash against governor florio and mr bradley s refusal to talk about the governor s unpopular tax increases nevertheless , it gave her instant name recognition among voters she nearly knocked off new jersey s premier political icon , said ross baker , professor of political science at rutgers university in new brunswick that clearly gives her a lot of credibility at the manor in west orange , 150 republican women were waiting to hear what ms whitman had to say for herself before her formal speech , she worked the room her style bore little resemblance to the way most politicians , including governor florio , perform that task ms whitman moved tentatively from one person to another , smiling and gently shaking hands , maintaining a measured distance there were no shouts of recognition , no hearty laughs , no arms flung over shoulders in her speech , ms whitman concentrated on what she would not do as governor she would not do what mr florio has done i do n't like what i 've seen happen in the state of new jersey in the last three years , she said it s common sense not to spend more than you take in , and it s common sense to know where you want to go before you try to get there we 've given him over 7 billion in new money over the last three years , she continued , referring to revenue raised by taxes mr florio has imposed since taking office in 1990 the question that has to be answered is , 'what happened to it \? ' for a 'business friendly' state ms whitman also criticized what she called mr florio s reluctance to bring people into the process of government decisions that adversely affected business like the increase in the sales tax and the stiffening of regulatory policies had not been discussed with business leaders , she said , adding we 've got to make this state business friendly we need jobs , and we ca n't have jobs without businesses
credit the many people involved in turning cyrano de bergerac from a lyrical , swashbuckling french play into a dutch musical into a 7 million englishlanguage musical with at least one success its plot is as easy to follow as a synopsis laid out in cliffs notes indeed , for all its technologically sophisticated sets and elaborately orchestrated score , cyrano the musical , which opened last night at the neil simon theater , comes across as a lavishly illustrated study guide , with many helpful , cipherlike characters in sumptuous historical costumes taking pains to explain who they are and what they 're doing it is not unusual for songs to include phrases like but let me tell you what happened yesterday or roxane , so you 're still here it must be seven years now such clarity of exposition may be a virtue but it does n't leave much room for the rhapsodic infatuation with words that was at the heart of edmond rostand s 1898 masterpiece of theatrical hokum and was the very lifeblood of its title character , the longbeaked , poeticsouled chevalier of 17thcentury paris even though the lines are almost entirely sung \( this cyrano is more a popoperetta than a conventional musical \) , so many of them are devoted to expositional recitative that the entire work feels closer to textbook prose than poetry as directed by eddy habbema \( who also staged the production in amsterdam , to great success \) , it is a fairly efficient piece of storytelling but it seldom gets much closer to rostand s heady flights of rodomontade and romanticism , or truly felt emotions , than an entry in a reader s encyclopedia do n't put too much blame on bill van dijk , the dutch actor who created the title part in the original version and stars again here he is a likable and charming performer , who sings in english with a clarion voice and unselfconscious fluency but he lacks the titanic presence of a character who has created , through flamboyantly heroic words and gestures , an outsized aura commensurate to the size of his legendary nose in his dueling scenes , mr van dijk is scrappy but curiously inept and , urging his fellow soldiers on to glory through death in the play s climactic battle scenes , he seems more like a spunky mascot than a charismatic leader the biggest problem , however , in raising this cyrano into the theatrical empyrean where he belongs lies not with mr van dijk but with the show s lyricists koen van dijk , who wrote the original book and score in dutch peter reeves , its english lyricist , and the broadway veteran sheldon harnick , who is credited with additional lyrics \( just to get this out of the way , the show s composer is ad van dijk , and none of these van dijks are related \) the writers have been unable to find a way of translating the bravura linguistic arias rostand gave his title hero with any comparable flair the most famous of them , in which cyrano offers 19 stylistic variations on ways to make fun of his nose here shrivels into a limp succession of rhymes a snorer or a borer or an odor explorer , for example that are hardly the stuff of verbal pyrotechnics most of the lyrics , actually , are simply functional and as unquotable as recipes most of cyrano s grand gestures , both physical and verbal , tend to get lost amid the truly spectacular multiple changes of baroqueflavored scenery by paul gallis \( often achieved with the gaspinducing use of hydraulic lifts \) and the successive ensemble scenes of crowds in opulent period costumes by yan tax these grandiose set pieces keep coming at us so rapidly and dazzlingly that they do n't really have a chance to establish their reason to be and some of them , like an unbearably cute dancingnun sequence in the convent to which roxane has retired at the play s end , should have been scrapped long ago ad van dijk s music , which recalls the mechanically propulsive score of les miserables , keeps the plot marching , marching , marching along at a military clip , with suspenseful shadings of orchestral dissonance in the background for the scenes involving the triangular love story between cyrano , his beautiful cousin roxane \( anne runolfsson \) and the handsome but inarticulate christian \( paul anthony stewart \) , for whom cyrano provides the words to court the woman both men love , the music shifts into a romantic pop tunefulness that suggests the ballads from the disney cartoon fantasies beauty and the beast and aladdin the famous balcony scene , in which cyrano plays eloquent promptmaster to the tonguetied christian , still retains vestiges of its comic poignancy but , for the most part , the characters have all the individualized vividness of figures in a history pageant the principals generally sing pleasantly and cleanly , although the amplification system sometimes makes it difficult to tell who is singing what ms runolfsson has a flexible voice that shifts , with crowdpleasing virtuosity , between ethereal melodiousness and piercing bigmoment resonance she is a curiously stalwart roxane , more at home visiting the lines of battle than in the misty tableaux that place her on a platform against a full moon , where she looks like glenda the good witch in the wizard of oz that round , melancholy moon hovers symbolically over much of the evening in one of the more memorable scenes from the original , cyrano actually pretends to be a visitor from the moon , who expatiates whimsically on his travels through the stars in a way , of course , cyrano is from the moon , from a realm of vaulting fancy that disdains the paltriness and mediocrity of the society in which he finds himself in this new version , that kinship is absent cyrano sees the moon as a distant , omniscient watcher who looks down on him with a cold objective eye he actually tells it , yes , i know you perceive the reason why i can never tell roxane what she means to me clearly , this cyrano and its title character will always be grounded on the earth cyrano the musical book and lyrics by koen van dijk , based on the play by edmond rostand music by ad van dijk english lyrics by peter reeves additional

you did a good job , he would say voting and electing people who formerly were not electable because of the color of their skin you have more political power and that is good you did a good job , he would say , letting people who have the ability to do so , live wherever they want to live , go wherever they want to go in this great country you did a good job , he would say , elevating people of color into the ranks of the united states armed forces to the very top or into the very top of our government you did a very good job , he would say he would say , did a good job creating a black middle class of people who really are doing well , and the middle class is growing more among african americans than among nonafrican americans you did a good job you did a good job in opening opportunity but he would say , i did not live and die to see the american family destroyed i did not live and die to see 13yearold boys get automatic weapons and gun down 9yearolds just for the kick of it i did not live and die to see young people destroy their own lives with drugs and then build fortunes destroying the lives of others that is not what i came here to do i fought for freedom , he would say , but not for the freedom of people to kill each other with reckless abandonment , not for the freedom of children to have children and the fathers of the children to walk away from them and abandon them , as if they do n't amount to anything i fought for people to have the right to work , but not to have whole communities and people abandoned this is not what i lived and died for , my fellow americans , he would say i fought to stop white people from being so filled with hate that they would wreak violence on black people i did not fight for the right of black people to murder other black people with reckless abandonment death on a dare the other day , the mayor of baltimore , a dear friend of mine , told me a story of visiting the family of a young man who had been killed 18 years old on halloween he always went out with littlebitty kids so they could trick or treat safely and across the street from where they were walking on halloween , a 14yearold boy gave a 13yearold boy a gun and dared him to shoot the 18yearold boy and he shot him dead and the mayor had to visit the family in washington , dc , where i live your nation s capital , the symbol of freedom throughout the world look how that freedom is being exercised the other night , a man came along the street and grabbed a 1yearold child and put the child in his car the child may have been the child of the man and two people were after him and they chased him in the car and they just kept shooting with reckless abandonment , knowing that baby was in the car and they shot the man dead , and a bullet went through his body into the baby s body and blew the little bootee off the child s foot the other day on the front page of our paper , the nation s capital are we talking about world peace or world conflict \? you know , a big article on the front page of the washington post about an 11yearold child planning her funeral these are the hymns i want sung this is the dress i want to wear i know i'm not going to live very long that is not the freedom the freedom to die before you 're a teenager is not what martin luther king lived and died for more than 37 , 000 people die from gunshot wounds in this country every year gunfire is the leading cause of death in young men and now that we 've all gotten so cool that everybody can get a semiautomatic weapon , a person shot now is three times more likely to die than 15 years ago , because they 're likely to have three bullets in them a hundredandsixtythousand children stay home from school every day because they are scared they will be hurt in their school the other day , i was in california at a town meeting , and a handsome young man stood up and said , mr president , my brother and i , we do n't belong to gangs we do n't have guns we do n't do drugs we want to go to school we want to be professionals we want to work hard we want to do well we want to have families and we changed our school , because the school we were in was so dangerous so , when we showed up to the new school to register , my brother and i were standing in line , and somebody ran in the school and started shooting a gun , and my brother was shot down standing right in front of me at the safer school
paris , june 11 richard serra was in his element partly , that meant he was in europe , which he believes has always supported his work more loyally and intelligently than the united states unfortunately , it also meant reykjavik , iceland , and a rain driven nearly horizontal to the grasstufted volcanic rock and mixed with pinpricks of hail i love this light , he said , squinting up at the implacable , slategray sky and i love the look of the piece when it s wet he had a point afangar the name was taken from an icelandic epic and means something like wandering about in a contemplative mood consists of nine pairs of hexagonal stone pillars , natural crystalline formations hacked from a quarry in the middle of iceland and transported to the site the pairs outline the small island on which the piece stands , like viking totems when the weather is dry , the stones look light gray and are flecked with bird droppings wet , they 're shiny and black , nordic cousins of the jupiterian sentinels in the film 2001 a couple of days later , on a lovely spring afternoon on the grounds of an elegant baroque chateau an hour s drive from paris , mr serra was in a very different element it s always like this , he chuckled , strolling across an expanse of manicured lawn after a sumptuous luncheon in the chateau dining room the occasion was the mockingup of a sculptural project commissioned by the chateau s owner , francois pinault the grounds are dotted with giant sculptures by the likes of picasso , moore and mondrian assuming final contractual details are ironed out soon , mr pinault by this fall will also possess a richard serra sculpture 10 rectangular pieces of corten steel deployed in asymmetrical formality in an allee defined by rows of ancient trees intense and a little nervous , mr serra supervised the positioning of the wooden boxes , painted a deep red rust color , on the lawn the models are good , he muttered to himself let s hope the piece is good the 'tilted arc' matter these very different works give an idea of the contrasting reception mr serra has received in his native united states and in europe in america , several of his public installations have provoked angry controversy , the most notorious incident occurring in 1989 when his tilted arc , was removed from its site in lower manhattan and destroyed , as he still puts it bitterly his sensuous curving abstractions , charged with industrial might , strike some as inherently hostile , as does the artist s confrontational , aggressively selfrighteous style mr serra is convinced that europeans simply have more taste than americans be that as it may , a closer look suggests other reasons for his european success as well in europe , he said , there is a longstanding commitment to art for its social function , not predicated on a secondary sale overall , he estimated , 75 percent of his work over the last 20 years has been commissioned and built in europe mr serra believes he has been stigmatized in the united states you 're given a characterization that becomes an imprint in people s minds , he worried i would come back to america and there was such a level of rejection for years i was glad to get back to europe certainly the europeans have generally accorded him a reception worthy of a modern master afangar is on an island called videy in the reykjavik harbor to the south lies the capital itself , home to threefifths of the country s 250 , 000 inhabitants to the north are spectacular , snowstreaked mountains and the blueblack atlantic ocean the island is sacred to the icelanders as the site of the first viking landing 1 , 100 years ago festive opening the piece , a joint commission by the municipal and national governments , was installed three years ago , with an opening ceremony featuring recitations of epic poetry , a huge beach bonfire , trumpets from the surrounding rocks and much champagne since then it has occasioned little or no public opposition partly that is because for most of the year its public consists of a couple of caretakers and a great many birds , several of which can be found perching on the pillars at any given time but during the summer , when ferries bring visitors over from reykjavik , it has proved a popular attraction , so much so that a stone path has been laid to link the pillars on the south side of the island mr serra himself revisits it every so often , just to see iceland again and to sketch in paris , a similar interest in mr serra s work can be found , combined with a willingness to preserve it for posterity mr pinault seems ready to sign a contract that will insure the eventual donation of mr serra s new piece and the land on which it will stand to the french state the city of paris already boasts four serra sculptures aside from his sometimes abrasive personality , part of mr serra s problems in the united states come from his outspoken leftism , which did n't sit well in the reaganbush years his heman minimalism , as his art was once called , seemed incongruously moralistic amid the 1980 s rage for pop and graffiti art and the 90 s climate of hypersensitivity and political correctness finds him again at odds with prevailing mores two accidents in the installation of his multiton steel sculptures one worker lost his life in 1971 , and another a leg in 1988 further fueled an image of callousness
washington , nov 1 accepting a state tax case with important implications for international tax policy , the supreme court agreed today to decide whether the constitution limits the ability of states to tax multinational corporations on a portion of their earnings beyond the state s borders the court s action surprised nearly everyone who has followed the case , and handed the clinton administration a political predicament as unwelcome as it was unexpected at issue is a method that california applied until last month to tax the income of both foreign and domestic multinational corporations the 'unitary' approach the method , known as worldwide combined reporting , made no distinction between subsidiaries doing business in california and those operating elsewhere the entire business was instead treated as unitary and subject to california tax on a portion of its worldwide income reflecting california s share of its overall property , payroll and sales the california approach has long angered the united states' trading partners the federal government , as well as most states and foreign countries , uses an arm slength accounting method under which each affiliated corporation is treated as a separate entity , subject to tax only in the jurisdiction in which it operates and for the income it realizes on its own books the california law was challenged by the londonbased barclays bank in a taxrefund suit that had the support not only of the british government , but also of the bush administration when the case first reached the court in early 1992 at that time , the court declined for procedural reasons to hear the case candidate clinton s stance campaigning then in california as a presidential candidate , bill clinton promised california tax officials that in contrast to the bush white house , a clinton administration will be procalifornia in this litigation barclays , which lost its case before the california court of appeal , appealed again to the supreme court earlier this year , and the justices asked the clinton administration for its views faced with balancing longstanding federal tax policy against the president s campaign promise , the administration held off until last month , acting a day after the california legislature repealed the disputed tax policy amid increasing pressure from the state s corporate taxpayers skirting the legal merits of the case , the administration s brief said there was now no need to consider barclays s appeal the court today , however , granted review not only in barclays case , barclays v franchise tax board , no 921384 , but also agreed to hear another challenge to the california law brought by the colgatepalmolive company like barclays , colgate is a multinational , but unlike barclays , it is based in the united states ten years ago , in a landmark tax case , container corporation v franchise tax board , the supreme court upheld the application of california s unitary tax to a domestic multinational , so the court s action today was especially surprising by granting review in colgatepalmolive v franchise tax board , no 921839 , the court is at least implying that this entire approach to taxation is under review and that the container case could be overruled in the 1983 container decision , the court did not address the application of the california tax to foreign multinationals , saying only that the outcome would be governed by the constitution s foreign commerce clause , which gives congress the power to regulate commerce with foreign nations in light of today s action , the question now seems to be whether the foreign commerce clause really makes a difference in the court s analysis , or whether the two situations should be treated similarly several other states have laws like california s former law , but none of those states come close to having an economy the size of california s california says it faces a potential refund liability of 4 billion if its former tax is found to be unconstitutional i 'd be concerned if i were california , mark l evans , a tax lawyer here who has followed the cases , said today cigarette tax case from new york in another taxrelated case , the court accepted an appeal from the new york state department of taxation and agreed to decide whether the state can regulate the sale of cigarettes on indian reservations sales made on reservations to indian purchasers cannot be taxed , under a doctrine known as tribal sovereign immunity sales made on reservations to nonindians are subject to tax , but states have typically had difficulty enforcing the law because many nonindians visit reservations to buy untaxed merchandise the new york court of appeals ruled in the summer , in a suit brought by a nonindian wholesaler , that new york s latest effort , a coupon system intended to limit a tribe s acquisition of untaxed cigarettes to the amount that tribal members will actually consume , was preempted by federal law the state s appeal is new york v milhelm attea bros , no 93377
frederic v salerno , vice chairman of the nynex corporation , has spent the last 18 months gearing up for the fight of his career shuttling between his office in white plains and his investment bankers at morgan stanley , he has been poring over maps , studying demographics and using computer models to size up the competition in nynex s new york and new england markets his conclusions have been sobering if we do nothing , we can expect an erosion in our residential telephone market share of 40 percent over the next decade , he said that translates to a loss of 16 billion in annual revenue alternatively , if nynex spends billions a year on fiber optics and video technology , it will lose only 10 percent of the telephone market but may make back the difference in cable television who could possibly grab more than 1 billion in annual sales from one of the seven regional bell companies \? answer another bell company , or several of them , in league with cable television operators in manhattan and queens , u s west of englewood , colo , has hooked up with time warner to upgrade cable tv lines for telephones and a host of futuristic services to the east , on long island , u s west and southwestern bell of san antonio are vying to buy the cablevision systems corporation , which serves about two million customers in nynex s market finally , bell atlantic of philadelphia is buying telecommunications inc , the country s biggest cable company , which has systems sprinkled across new york and massachusetts ten years after the breakup of the old bell system , the seven baby bells are rapidly dividing into hunters and prey led by bell atlantic and u s west , the hunters are using their alliances with cable television systems to raid their siblings' territories while most publicity about the recent mergers has focused on the offering of futuristic services , it is the huge 100 billion market for basic phone service that is most ripe for plundering as a result , industry analysts say , many local telephone companies are in for a competitive shock that could rival what the american telephone and telegraph company endured in the longdistance market a decade ago indeed , mr salerno s worstcase scenario for nynex closely matches at t s loss of market share from nearly 100 percent in the late 1970 s to just over 60 percent today goliath vs goliath for the baby bells , the world is evolving into one divided between the haves and the havenots , said daniel p reingold , a communications analyst at merrill lynch it is now crystal clear that the haves are going to be attacking the havenots , and that investors will have to value these two types of companies very differently the transformation of a sibling rivalry into outright warfare pitting goliath against goliath has profound implications not just for the baby bells , but for consumers as well within five years , consumers in big cities may have a choice between two companies offering local telephone service , and the competition may lead to better prices and enhanced features but it is also possible that residents in relatively unprofitable inner city markets or rural areas could see their service get worse , as telephone companies devote money and people to shoring up their most profitable lines of business with corporations and affluent residential customers the risks for the baby bells are enormous those that are uncertain of their strategy or that do n't line up big cable partners notably nynex , ameritech inc of chicago and the pacific telesis group in san francisco risk becoming secondtier players with a shrinking revenue base or even disappearing as independent companies but such aggressive players as bell atlantic and u s west are taking chances too , by spending billions on cable companies and on constructing new kinds of networks that may not click with consumers until we 've got some certainty or some reasonable feel for demand , we 're not going to go overboard deploying technology , said robert t burns , head of strategic planning at the bellsouth corporation in atlanta bellsouth has been concentrating less on cable deals and more on wireless services , as well as on modernizing its network for traditional phone service to business customers for now , at least , wall street is rewarding the aggressive companies with higher stock prices bell atlantic stock is up 154 percent this year , closing friday at 59125 u s west has jumped 209 percent , to 46375 in contrast , nynex climbed just 22 percent , to 42875 and those telephone company executives who have been waiting to make a big move in cable may find it is getting to be too late because the cable industry is dominated by a handful of big companies , just a few strategically significant players remain up for grabs these include cablevision systems bostonbased continental cablevision , with 29 million subscribers and cox cable , owned by cox enterprises of atlanta , with 15 million subscribers other permutations

two weeks ago , earn j lloyd of the bronx staggered into the emergency room at montefiore medical center nearly comatose , nearly blind and barely able to walk doctors discovered he had severe diabetes , which kept him in the hospital for the next 10 days but mr lloyd s more serious medical problem was the lack of a decent general doctor , which for him and hundreds of thousands of others in new york s poorer neighborhoods , turns treatable outpatient diseases like diabetes into lifethreatening conditions in vast stretches of inner city new york from harlem to crown heights to morris heights , where mr lloyd lives there are only a handful of doctors and virtually none who offer patients a reasonable standard of primary care this severe deficit of doctors in poor urban neighborhoods will make president clinton s health care plan , or any alternative , difficult to carry out in the areas that most need the help the president proposes to guarantee coverage for all , and plans to enroll the poorest in healthmaintenance organizations but unless there is a dramatic improvement in the quantity and quality of inner city doctors , policy experts say , many patients will still head to the emergency room for their care i do n't care what kind of health care card you 're carrying , it wo n't help you if the doctors and facilities are n't there , said ronda kotelchuck , executive director of the new york state primary care development corporation , a new organization to finance the building of clinics in underserved areas the number of doctors willing and eager to practice in the poorest neighborhoods , always inadequate , has dwindled to practically none in recent years because of low medicaid reimbursement rates , the threat of violence and the shifting focus of medical education away from general doctoring and toward specialty training as a result , people in these areas go without personal doctors or are forced to rely on practitioners who are doctors in name only , providing little in the way of useful care a 1990 survey by the community service society of new york found only 28 properly qualified doctors to serve a population of 17 million in nine lowincome neighborhoods in harlem , north central brooklyn and the south bronx the snapshot was bleak and there was a concentration of older physicians who were nearing retirement , so we have every expectation that the situation has gotten worse , said david r jones , the society s president the society is a nonprofit organization that is concerned with issues like the health and housing of the city s neediest still there are some signs of hope the expectation of increased federal and state payments for taking care of the poor has prompted a spurt of clinic building in areas where there were formerly none and new york city recently opened two communicare clinics , communitybased primary care centers , and five more are under contruction but healthpolicy experts expect the supply to lag far behind the demand as a result , people like mr lloyd will be using emergency rooms because the few doctors in their neighborhoods are unable to provide the most basic medical care an xray , a blood test or even an evaluation of a bad sore throat mr lloyd said he dutifully kept his monthly appointments at a grimy storefront clinic in morris heights even though the doctor there never spent more than eight or nine minutes with him and never examined him before refilling prescriptions for pain and high blood pressure medicines bleak pictures of care and when he fell desperately ill on a saturday , he had no other choice but to use an emergency room the clinic is closed on nights and weekends and his doctor is not affiliated with any hospital i heard the doctor there was ok , mr lloyd said he took my medicaid card so i went there estimates of the shortage of general doctors in the city range from 500 to 1 , 400 , with most of the deficit in poorer neighborhoods a recent study by the health systems agency of new york city found that there were 06 primary care doctors per 1 , 000 people in morris heights , while the upper east side of manhattan had 64 per 1 , 000 the survey by the community service society presents a discouraging picture the society sent workers to knock on the doors of all the doctors' offices in parts of harlem , brooklyn and the south bronx of the 701 general doctors they found , only 28 or 39 percent met minimum federal standards for decent primary care many did not accept medicaid , were open less than 20 hours a week , did not provide afterhour coverage in case of emergencies , and did not have admitting privileges at a hospital for patients like mr lloyd , the lack of reasonable primary care means that coughs are neglected until they become pneumonia and chronic conditions like asthma , diabetes and hypertension which are generally controlled under the supervision of an attentive doctor go untreated until patients are so sick that they need an ambulance
on television , over the radio and in the newspapers over the last month , mayor david n dinkins has been called cruel to children , kindly to criminals and insufficiently mindful of fire hazards advertisements have also implied that he lies and , oddly , coddles sanitation workers to the average citizen of new york city , it might seem that the 1993 campaign for mayor is going full tiltbut the charges are not being fired by the other mayoral candidates they are coming from some of the municipal employee unions teachers , police officers and firefighters , all of whom have been working without a contract since at least october 1991 while advertising by unions , particularly in the newspapers , is not unheard of , the intensity and sophistication of these campaigns is a first and may herald a new form of political warfare in the city , union officials and other students of city politics said as the unions seek contracts from the city , they have turned to advertising as perhaps the best weapon they have left the old ways of influencing city officials can no longer be counted on demonstrations and sickouts do n't carry the same influence strikes have become too costly uncharted territory what the unions have learned is that the era of demonstrations and marches is over , said mitchell l moss , director of the new york university urban research center the era of direct marketing is here , and this is new york s version of it it is also uncharted territory and not everyone is convinced the ads will help the unions in fact , some say they will backfire , strengthening the mayor s support among voters tired of union influence , giving him the image of a leader with backbone some even suspect a subtler motive in the ads solving union leaders' own image problems by making them seem tough to their members in the last month teachers , for the first time , have run a television campaign calling for a contract , police officers have run advertisements on radio and in the newspapers and firefighters have turned to print all three unions said they plan to run more advertisements as their contract negotiations develop phil caruso , president of the patrolmen s benevolent association , which ran radio and print ads calling for higher salaries and criticizing the mayor last week , said that advertising allowed his union to get equal time in the media surrogate striking' the mayor can get all the time he wants , he said the newspapers can take us to task every day what can we do to get our message across as trenchantly as possible \? the answer is newspaper , television and radio ads such advertising is a form of surrogate striking , said richard c wade , a professor of urban history at the graduate center of the city university of new york although a strike remains the most potent weapon , he said , it has become too expensive , because of state laws that penalize workers two days' salary for each day they strike in addition , in tight budget times , the public might not support a strike , he said but mayoral aides said the campaigns would not affect contract negotiations and were probably not even intended to do so they 're all directed at internal constituencies to demonstrate that leadership is making its case , first deputy mayor norman steisel said while the barrage of attacks on such issues as educating children might seem likely to hurt the mayor s image , mr steisel contended that the campaigns could actually help mr dinkins politically at the end of the day , it s better for the mayor to be seen as sticking to his guns , he said andrew j stein , who plans to challenge mr dinkins for the democratic nomination , has repeatedly criticized mr dinkins for being too generous to the unions , a charge that could be neutralized by the advertising campaigns none of the unions have endorsed a mayoral candidate yet although the advertisements may not directly affect contract negotiations , they address many audiences and serve several purposes at the same time , experts on city politics said in addition to putting some pressure on the administration , they may inform the general public of the contract disputes , bolster sympathy for certain city workers , persuade union members that their leaders are fighting for them and preemptively warn likely mayoral candidates , including rudolph w giuliani , not to bash the unions in seeking public support for example , the slickest campaign , paid for by the united federation of teachers , emphasized how much teachers love their difficult and equated the needs of the teachers with those of their pupils milliondollar campaign if the mayor of this city really cared about teachers and the kids that we serve , we would get a contract , and we would get it now , says a teacher in one of the spots an independent threemember panel is now mediating between the city and the teachers , but any recommendations it makes for a contract will be nonbinding , meaning there will most likely be further negotiations
when the federal government imposed a law in 1986 requiring the nation s school districts to scour their classrooms , cafeterias and gymnasiums for asbestos , it relied on a basic assumption that districts under pressure to comply with the law and the companies they hired to help to do so would tell the truth it was that assumption that allowed rampant mismanagement , incompetence and possibly fraud to continue unchecked in new york city s program to test for asbestos even as a series of warnings about discrepancies in the board of education s program raised troubling questions from the start since the federal law , known as the asbestos hazard emergency response act of 1986 , required no automatic verification of reports intended to show the location of asbestos in each school , officials and the public had what two independent investigators called a misplaced reliance on inaccurate reports it was as if a teacher gave a test , then checked only to see whether the students answered the questions without bothering to determine if the answers themselves were correct unreliable reports there were warnings to different people in different places about the program , said meyer s frucher , a trustee of the school construction authority , the agency that builds and repairs the city s schools but it is true that no one ever looked back to say the entire system was faulty the scope of the inaccuracies came to light only in june when workers repairing a leaky roof at public school 1 in chinatown found asbestos where the school s report on it had declared there was none the discovery led the independent investigators to reexamine the tests catalogued in 21 reports , leading them to conclude that the reports were so unreliable as to be meaningless the stunning failure of new york s asbestos testing program has raised a question of whether other school districts around the nation might also be relying on reports that have never been challenged for their accuracy because of what s happened in new york , many school districts in the country may have reason to be concerned , said gary marx of the american association of school administrators in virginia most school districts were very diligent to comply with the regulations , but they are dependent on the quality of the inspections and the quality of the work an emergency effort , announced by mayor david n dinkins when the investigators' findings were released on aug 6 , is under way to determine how many of the city s 1 , 069 schools have asbestos in its most dangerous form , exposed and flaking airborne particles lack of challenges until that survey is completed probably not in all schools before classes begin on sept 9 the extent of the deception in the asbestostesting reports will not be fully known what is clear is that the deception was allowed to continue for four years , despite stark warnings from the environmental protection agency , the city comptroller and the board s own buildings division , the school construction authority in each case , the board referred warnings about the asbestos program to the division that carried out the program in the first place , the board s asbestos task force no agency within the state or city challenged the integrity of the task force s work , the asbestos testing reports , and apparently no one came forward to ask them to do so stanley litow , a former deputy chancellor from 1990 until june , said , nobody raised a red flag and said there s a pattern of problems with the asbestos testing reports how would somebody know that \? he said asbestos , a fibrous mineral , was widely used as a fireretardant insulation in homes and public buildings from 1952 to 1976 , when its use was banned after studies showed it could cause cancer and other lung diseases if its microscopic fibers were inhaled the 1986 asbestos law required the nation s school districts to inspect for asbestos , remove the most dangerous form of it , and complete a management plan by may 1989 , or face fines of 5 , 000 a day a task many school administrators complained at the time was onerous and expensive the law also required states to designate an agency to collect and monitor the management plans in new york , that agency was the state s department of education , which required the 758 school districts to submit a brief , sixpage summary of their reports the reports themselves remained in the schools where parents or anyone else could request to see them from the start , the enormous task of meeting the deadline was disorganized and increasingly frantic by october 1988 , as the deadline approached , 26 inexperienced inspectors , trained and supervised by an environmental consultant that lacked experience in training asbestos inspectors , envirosafe , had made little progress in scouring the schools they were joined by other inspectors , for a total of 70 , but in the final three months they were expected to survey thousands of sites in five schools each day a task described as virtually impossible
to the editor the north american free trade agreement will be a disaster for this country and especially its working people if the clinton administration insists on supporting what is basically a flawed investment agreement the american federation of laborcongress of industrial organizations believes that international trade can benefit the american economy but we do n't believe in the free trade agreement because , even with the collateral agreements negotiated by the clinton administration , it would undermine wages and working conditions in the united states and canada , and do little to improve the condition of mexican workers a trade agreement should recognize economic disparities , anticipate the likely human impact and advance the wellbeing of citizens in each country this one does none of those the agreement would help united states companies invest more freely in mexico , essentially to allow multinationals to exploit that country s cheap labor and lax environmental and safety enforcement it is an investment agreement , not a trade agreement , that would destroy jobs and depress wages in the industrialized united states and canada , while doing nothing to advance the povertylevel wages and living conditions paid by united states employers to workers in mexico the trade agreement represents a highrisk experiment in which countries at far different stages of economic development and democratic rights attempt to merge their economies mexico s poverty rate is 40 percent , its unemployment rate in excess of 20 percent , and its gross domestic product a 20th of that of the united states average mexican families simply cannot afford to purchase the products they make , much less buy goods made in the united states the north american governments agreed to address the overlooked issues of labor rights and standards and the environment only after the 2 , 000page trade agreement was signed and only after a change in united states presidents but the side agreements are woefully lacking they would provide no effective remedy to protect worker rights and labor standards , in contrast to specific provisions to protect holders of patents and copyrights the side agreements limit labor complaints to three issues child labor , minimum wage , and job health and safety effectively scuttling remedies available under united states trade laws and they create a bureaucratic nightmare that would keep labor and environmental complaints tied up in endless consultation , with no remedy in sight the voices that should be heard are the people who will be most affected by this proposed treaty they are the united states workers who will lose their jobs the communities worried about the spread of diseases they once thought were eliminated citizens worried about maintaining standards for food inspection and the use of toxic chemicals , and human rights activists on both sides of the border concerned about child labor and insufferable living conditions instead of a government that worships at the corporate bottom line and leaves working people undefended in the jungle of the international marketplace , we are calling for a government that is on the side of the workers one that fights to rebuild the country s economic strength and provides fair opportunities and equal justice for all edward j cleary president new york state aflcio new york , sept 2 , 1993
lillehammer , norway greg gumbel sat in the shadow of a 7foot troll , the owner of a droopy 18inchlong nose , at a table in a troll theme park restaurant he was moved to ask , almost plaintively , should n't a thesis be written about how many nightmares norwegian children have from these things \? gumbel ate none of the smoked fish and cured meat that was the day s lunch fare gamey , he pronounced the buffet but gumbel s refusal to eat fits into the nonparticipation broadcast philosophy of cbs s primetime anchor for next year s winter olympics in lillehammer , norway i 've never been on skis and i 've never been on skates , he said yesterday during a press tour of the olympic venues brian boitano thinks he 'll get me on skates he smirked at the notion one winter in washington , he recalled , young greg and his younger brother , bryant , were summoned to observe their first snow my father said , 'gregory , bryant , come out here ! ' i came out , looked up and said , 'that s good , ' and we went back inside it has been a love affair ever since i 've come to appreciate these sports , he said , but i do n't believe in exposing myself to coldweather elements in the eyes of cbs sports , gumbel was the perfect choice to be the primetime anchor , a much more appropriate choice than the mismatched duo of tim mccarver and paula zahn , who were paired as host and hostess of cbs s primetime telecasts of last year s winter olympics in albertville , france call it skispan there is a profound difference in the tvwatching habits of americans and norwegians while cbs will devote about 90 minutes of its 120 hours to crosscountry skiing , norwegian state television will set aside 80 hours of its dawntodawn menu of 300 hours for the sport odd kaldefoss , the producer of norway s coverage , said proudly we 'll cover the 50kilometer race from start to finish one norwegian who happened to be touring the crosscountry venue joked that while his countrymen are rightly rapt over the prospect of fourscore hours of crosscountry skiing , he could n't understand how americans could watch long hours of baseball coverage the joke is , we do n't , cracked neal pilson , the president of cbs sports we watch and we sleep i shot a fiery arrow from the air the view from atop the skijumping venue offers a glorious vista of lake mjosa , the largest lake in northern europe \( which had once been considered as a frozen parking lot for 6 , 000 cars during the olympics \) the amphitheater that will be the site of the opening and closing ceremonies is being built at the foot of the two skijump runs the lillehammer olympic organizing committee is planning something spectacular a skijumper leaping toward the amphitheater with the torch to light the olympic flame during the opening ceremony pilson suggested an extra wrinkle have the skijumper shoot a flaming arrow into the cauldron to light the flame share a moment on the storgata , lillehammer s miracle mile cbs will take enormous advantage of norway s folklore and landscapes one site that will become familiar is the cobblestoned storgata , the main drag in lillehammer on wednesday , a crowd gathered for the daily auction of the countdown shirt , which has sold for as little as a few hundred dollars and as much as 3 , 700 , in a special auction in minot , nd as the bidding of kroners \( seven equal a dollar \) rose by several hundred each round for the shirt marking 108 days until the olympic flame is lighted , pilson joked we paid 21 billion kroner for the olympics i do n't have to do anymore and if the goalie gets knocked senseless , we 'll get a great view of the roof the latest itsybitsy technical innovation used by cbs will be a tiny camera attached to a groove in the mask of united states team goalies no other hockey federation would give it the ok , said sandy grossman , cbs s hockey director goaliecam can be used during live action , much like the helmetcam of the defunct world league of american football was but grossman wo n't be able to stagemanage the united states goalkeeper i 'd really like to say , 'turn this way turn that way , ' he said no matter how hard a puck may hit the goalie in the mask , or in the battery pack that will be attached to his waist , grossman vows that the camera will keep working if the camera takes a direct hit \? a great replay , grossman said share a moment with prince hakon cbs will not stray far from its share a moment with the world promotional campaign that blitzed american viewers before the 1992 winter olympics and now it has tiny prince hakon on its side one of cbs s first promotional spots will link the rescue of the infant prince by crosscountry skiers in 1205 to the arrival of heroic skiers in lillehammer for the 16 days of olympic games
monte carlo , monaco , sept 22 in an atmosphere that resembled a political convention more than a sporting occasion , the five cities bidding to be host to the 2000 summer olympics scrambled to outmaneuver one another today in the hope of influencing the international olympic committee s crucial vote thursday according to london bookmakers and an overheated monte carlo rumor mill , beijing is favored to win despite strong western criticism of china s humanrights record sydney , australia , is running second , and manchester , england , is a possible surprise choice , while berlin and istanbul are rank outsiders but , with the ioc due to make its decision by secret vote thursday evening , no city was about to throw in the towel today sweetvoiced children , beefy athletes and , of course , politicians were all on hand to sing the praises of the various cities competing for the best possible olympic gold three prime ministers john major of britain , paul keating of australia and tansu ciller of turkey will even be present when manchester , sydney and istanbul , respectively , make their final 55minute presentations to the ioc thursday in practice , 89 votes will be cast because one bulgarian member is under criminal investigation at home and has been forbidden to travel the ioc president , juan antonio samaranch of spain , who was reelected to another fouryear term by acclamation today , does not vote so the winning city will be the first to receive at least 45 votes if no city wins an absolute majority in the first round , the city with the least votes will be eliminated under new rules , though , the breakdown of votes will not be revealed to ioc members before they vote again with five contenders , a maximum of four voting rounds is therefore possible on the eve of the vote , the expectation is not only that beijing will win , but also that it might do so after just one or two rounds and , if this is the case , it might well reflect the ioc s anger over western demands that it reject beijing on humanrights grounds today , it was the turn of britain s environment minister , john gummer , to raise the problem of china s treatment of its dissidents i think there will be a time when beijing will be the very sensible hosts of an olympic games , he said i do not think that time is now while the united states congress and the european parliament as well as the british government have spoken out against beijing s bid , the australian , german and turkish governments have been more cautious , fearing that direct attacks on china may simply help beijing s case before the ioc today , vice premier li lanqing , who heads a 200member chinese delegation here , expressed the chinese government s full and unreserved support for beijing s bid as well as the ardent hope and fervent aspiration of the chinese people to host the 2000 olympics questioned about china s humanrights record , he pointed to china s rapid economic development and said that many who criticized its humanrights record had never visited the country we have a saying , it s better to see once than to hear 100 times , he said richard dicker of the new yorkbased lawyers' group known as human rights watch , said today that the humanrights issue will not go away even if beijing is picked framing the debate human rights is not deciding this money is but human rights has framed the olympic debate over the past six months , he noted for all the controversy over beijing s candidacy , monaco has insured that little spoils the party in this selfgoverning principality on the french riviera a group of tibetans and western sympathizers were banned by monaco s police from distributing leaflets , carrying banners or even wearing tshirts saying no beijing olympics 2000 free tibet several germans , including one journalist , who opposed berlin s candidacy , have also been asked to leave by local authorities apparently worried that antiolympic demonstrations might disrupt thursday s formal announcement ceremony at a series of news conferences today , however , competing cities were intent only on making lastminute sales pitches along with a halfdozen german gold medal winners from the 1992 summer olympics , for example , wilma rudolph , the american who won the women s 100 meters at the 1960 rome olympics , spoke out on behalf of berlin to me , berlin means more than just a city that will host the olympics , she said it symbolizes the whole idea of east and west coming together and the audiences i have performed before in berlin symbolize the friendship that makes the games what they are sydney used its news conference to disclose the results of a poll of 100 athletes in five european countries , including britain and germany , which showed that 60 favored sydney , 21 berlin , 10 manchester and 4 beijing five backed brasilia , which later withdrew its candidacy , and none supported istanbul rod mcgeouch , who heads sydney s bid committee , said he released the results of the poll in response to media inquiries it nonetheless served to reinforce sydney s claim that it offers the best sporting installations for any olympic event still hope for manchester refusing to give up hope , manchester s promoters , who brought a children s choir , a red doubledecker bus and a handful of cheerful bobbies along as props , said they thought that many ioc members had still not made up their minds we think the final presentations will be crucial , said bob scott , who heads the manchester bid only istanbul , it seems , is resigned to defeat but its bid has not gone unnoticed a huge turkish yacht , the savarona , which carries the colors of istanbul s candidacy , is docked in the port of monaco , dwarfing the yachts and cruise boats of the many millionaires who make monte carlo their home
while it would be especially gratifying to be able to welcome julie andrews back to the new york stage in a fullblown musical , putting it together , the revue of stephen sondheim songs at the manhattan theater club , will serve the purpose just fine more than fine , actually this is one smart and sexy evening , populated by some smart and sexy performers , plus the playwright chanteur christopher durang , who is not exactly sexy , perhaps , but has a definite ursine charm and the gleam of the friendly lunatic in his eye not content to be your usual anthology , putting it together is trying something different with three dozen or so of mr sondheim s songs , some familiar , some not , and nary a clinker among them although they 've been taken from musicals as diverse as assassins , merrily we roll along and a little night music and the movie dick tracy , the goal here is to weave them all together in a show they can call their own there s a plot , sort of , just as there are characters who trace a discernible dramatic arch in the course of the revue s two acts more about that in a minute , though first things first the big question , the burning question , the ungallant but unavoidable question on everyone s mind is this just how well is ms andrews holding up these days \? her last broadway appearance was in camelot more than 30 years ago , and while movies and television have kept her in view since then , movies and television have their devices for covering up a performer s shortcomings live and in person , you lay it all on the line ms andrews has absolutely nothing to fear dressed in a periwinkle blue pantsuit , she looks as trim as ever , moves with grace and generally conducts herself in her best my fair ladylike manner the fine arch of her neck has always been slightly deceptive , however if she possesses impeccable breeding , she also has a spine , and it bends only so far before the spark of rebellion is ignited in her small frame no one can get a laugh , as ms andrews can , simply by dropping her voice , turning elegantly on a boor and snapping , oh , shut up for others , the karate chops and the cans of mace she can put a person in his place with diction the upper register of her singing voice may no longer be as crystalline as it was back when she was announcing triumphantly to the world that she could have danced all night no matter she has matured handsomely as an actress , and putting it together affords her two distinct occasions to display a quickened intelligence and the sharp pinpricks of feeling at the end of act i , she takes effortlessly to the mocking wit and bitter irony of could i leave you \? \( from follies \) , suggesting in the process how medea might have behaved had she lived on park avenue her big secondact number , getting married today \( from company \) , contains what are probably mr sondheim s tonguetrippingest lyrics the streamofconsciousness mileaminute doubts of a bride who s experiencing second , third and fourth thoughts on the day of her wedding ms andrews gives herself over completely to the flood of emotions , even as she is bouncing consonants off the back wall with a marksman s precision i 've never heard panic articulated so crisply most of the time , however , the performer , forgoing a star s prerogatives , functions as part of an ensemble that , in addition to mr durang , includes stephen collins , michael rupert and rachel york , all dressed for a party and primed for whatever chance encounters may drift their way that s the loose conceit that mr sondheim and the director julia mckenzie have devised to justify the various numbers \( there s no dialogue to speak of \) ms andrews and mr collins , disaffected husband and disabused wife , are throwing the blacktie affair at which mr rupert , a bachelor , and ms york , a bombshell , are in attendance no one is quite sure who mr durang is all the same , he proves a most obliging presence by circulating the champagne , playing the piano and , when the hour grows late , proposing a round of parlor games in the course of things , flirtations are struck , jealousies are aired , seductions are chanced and a few blunt truths get uttered not all of the evening s songs adapt automatically to the new context some have to be coaxed and others bullied a bit the mordant gun song \( from assassins \) , asked to undergo the unlikeliest transformation , occasions one of those reckless truthtelling games whom in this room would you boom \? that have dampened more than one gathering on the other hand , all that s required to send you could drive a person crazy \( from company \) into fresh orbit is a simple change of pronoun i could drive a person crazy , warbles mr durang , who , when he comes to the doodoo , doodoo doos normally chimed by three women , sings them with the delight of a drunken reveler blowing his party horn in the ear of the nearest guest such numbers as lovely , sooner or later , hello little girl , have i got a girl for you and the miller s son can be easily used to chart progressive steps in the mating game , just as every day a little death , sorrygrateful and like it was can take us through a troubled relationship and out the other side the dynamics of social and sexual intercourse are the evening s underlying concern , and a more specific organizing principle just might rob the revue of its spontaneity it s enough to know that living rooms are never far from bedrooms and that the art decoish ramp leading into robin wagner s penthouse set can be traveled in two directions
a tall , spare man with receding reddishbrown hair wearing coffeetinted glasses used a faint , quavering falsetto to demonstrate how to project an operatic high note you must chew the breath , he said , speaking with a thick italian accent to a young soprano standing onstage beside him the student gazed dreamily into the tall man s eyes as she drew a breath and then nearly flattened him with a sonic boom lurching backward , the tall man chuckled softly with approval that s it ! he said , that s it ! franco corelli , the bestlooking , most temperamental and thrillingly voiced tenor at the metropolitan opera between his debut in 1961 and his final performance as calaf in turandot in december 1974 , was conducting a master class an audience of 500 , many wearing their old franco corelli is my kind of high buttons , crowded kaufmann concert hall at the 92d street y in manhattan on wednesday night the master class , in which mr corelli coached four young singers before an audience of opera lovers , was sponsored by the richard tucker music foundation an evanescent star it was mr corelli s first significant appearance on a new york stage in many years after retiring from the met , he sang a boheme or two in europe in 1975 and 1976 and made a brief appearance at the garden state arts festival in 1980 then he dropped out of sight he and his wife , loretta , continued to live quietly in their manhattan apartment near carnegie hall , but they were rarely seen in public occasionally , over the years , word would circulate among corelli fans that the tenor had performed on german television or had been heard at a benefit in italy but invariably it turned out that he had merely been interviewed and some of his old recordings had been played three years ago , his fans were electrified by a report that mr corelli , who is now nearly 70 , had hinted in an interview on opera fanatic on wkcrfm in new york that he had quit too soon and wished to make a comeback in the title role of verdi s otello he immediately received a blizzard of offers from opera companies around the country , but he accepted none , insisting that he had been misunderstood franco has been very reclusive , said the met baritone sherrill milnes , who attended the master class and embraced mr corelli at a reception afterward asked at the reception why he had stopped singing , mr corelli would only shake his head loretta corelli , who is often her husband s spokeswoman , said cryptically , whenever they ask , we are someplace else tony russo , mr corelli s longtime agent , said the tenor confided to him in the late 70 s that he had ruptured his vocal cords i do n't know whether that s true or not , mr russo said , but obviously he was having vocal difficulties an album he was recording at that time for emi was never completed the 'wet towel' school mr russo said his client had a growing interest in teaching last year , mr russo said , mr corelli spent a week with the pittsburgh opera holding master classes for 15 young singers at wednesday s class , mr corelli stood with his hands in his pockets and shifted his weight from one foot to the other as each of the four students sang an aria then he went over each rendition phrase by phrase , sometimes note by note , suggesting more legato here and more pianopiano or more forte there frequently he illustrated his points by singing in falsetto or mezza voce \( half volume \) , by conducting an imaginary orchestra or by gesturing vigorously in the air as if wringing a wet towel each singer tried to follow his instructions , and when the result was pleasing the audience exploded with applause and cries of bravo ! sometimes mr corelli simply asked for the expression of more feeling , remarking at one point gigli had melody in every note , and a heart bigger than the voice mr corelli s most intensive teaching concerned the production of sound , and there his pedagogy exemplified the fact that despite centuries of voice culture and the advances of modern physiology , no one can tell a person how to sing the muscles controlling the vocal cords , after all , cannot be moved consciously like the fingers of a pianist or the lips of a flutist consequently , when discussing technique , singers and voice teachers often resort to metaphorical language , such as mr corelli s chew the breath or , on occasion , mumbo jumbo pinch the uvula with the tonsils mr corelli also counseled too much in front ! and you must sing under the palate , not above the palate not ventriloquism these instructions express the placement of the voice theory developed by , among others , manuel garcia jr , a 19thcentury spanish baritone and voice teacher who invented the laryngoscope in 1855 garcia s theories , although unscientific , are strangely helpful to many singers mr corelli says it is possible to position the voice at a certain point in the throat to produce a brilliant tone according to the laws of physics , this is not possible because every soundproducing vibration goes into all cavities of the mouth , nose , throat and sinuses , vibrating the bony structures of the head and upper body all at once nevertheless , for mr corelli , creating the sensation that he is placing his voice in one part of his body achieves the desired result , and at least three of the four students participating in the master class agreed afterward that his directions had been helpful onstage and at the reception , mr corelli was mellow , greeting old friends warmly it was a far cry from the temperamental bundle of nerves he was in his youth , approaching every public appearance with terror written across his face he had the look of a man being led to execution another man onstage onstage , he was something else again at the rome opera house in 1958 he stabbed the basso boris christoff in the hand when he felt christoff was trying to upstage him later , while singing il trovatore at the san carlo in naples , he leaped into a box and attacked a spectator who had booed him when the two were separated , mr corelli had his stage sword half drawn on another occasion , when on tour with birgit nilsson in turandot , mr corelli turned to her when he was supposed to give her a stage kiss and bit her on the neck instead in their duet she had hung onto the high c longer than he did ms nilsson later wired rudolf bing , the general manager of the met i cannot go on to cleveland have rabies after mr corelli s sensational debut at the met as manrico in il trovatore , his musicianship was sometimes criticized but no one questioned his zeuslike power to produce a vocal thunderclap leonard bernstein once said mr corelli had the lungs of a camel in tosca , mr corelli could hold his high notes in the great secondact outburst vittoria ! vittoria ! , as the music critic harold schonberg put it in the new york times , until scarpia needs a shave but all that was years ago when a fan attending the master class asked mr corelli if he planned to sing again , the old wildeyed look of desperation flashed across his face and he almost shouted no , thank you !

philadelphia , may 23 if the mets want to see the worst team in the national league east , they need not look farther than their dugout if they want to see the best team , they need not look farther than across the field at veterans stadium monday night for the mets will finally see the philadelphia phillies , the bookend at the opposite end of the division , 14 1 2 games , and a seeming universe , away still , the mets could come into town and hope , if they are given to believing in miracles or that glasses can be half full , not half empty or that they are a lot closer to the phillies than the 14 1 2game bulge would otherwise lead you to believe a war of attrition why the room for optimism \? well , for one , the phillies have revealed themselves to possess feet of clay this may they just completed a fourgame series against the secondplace expos that was more a war of attrition than a display of great baseball between two beasts of the east the two clubs split the series , deciding nothing in their first meeting of the season esthetically speaking , things were even worse than the series wash in a 147 victory today , phillies pitchers allowed only five hits but they threw two wild pitches , walked eight and allowed seven runs phillies hitters , taking full advantage of the soft underbelly of the expos' pitching pounded out 15 hits , 7 for extra bases lenny dykstra alone had three doubles as the phillies achieved a season high in runs the two teams also combined for five errors today , bringing their fourgame total to 16 the phillies committed nine of them i do n't know what i can say about that game , said jim fregosi , the manager of a team suddenly doing a great impersonation of a sieve it was n't the bestplayed game , it was n't the bestplayed series neither club distinguished themselves a dose of the mets some choose to see the silver in the lining , not a forewarning that things may be starting to unravel this is a good ball club , a tremendous offensive ball club , said pete incaviglia , who contributed a tworun home run today we 've got to do the little things better , got to play defense better , pitch better but you 've got to give us credit we played good offense we just went out and took the ball game from them offensively so for now , the expos get to take their troubles home for a series against st louis the phillies get to stay right here and try to get healthier against the mets and it must be asked is it just what the phillies need , a good dose of bad mets' baseball \? darren daulton , the phillies' catcher , refused to bite at such questions yes , he acknowledged , the mets may be a wee bit more enthused because they have a new manager in big , bad dallas green , who , by the way , is a former phillies executive and the manager who guided the team to its only world series triumph , in 1980 but dallas does n't play for them , daulton said but i do n't take anybody lightly on any given day , any team can beat any other team and on any given day , any team can play down to its lowest expectations , too as have the mets all season and as have the phillies of late the avalanche of errors today was no aberration since may 15 , the phillies have committed 15 errors in nine games six of them came at shortstop in the last two days , with mariano duncan and juan bell each responsible for three dave hollins , the strongarmed third baseman who is nursing a bad wrist , has made eight errors in his last 26 games after having made none in his first 17 the sudden spate of sloppiness has spooned a sour dose of reality into the season of a team growing used to being labeled the best in all of baseball but the team that had lost only five games in april , has now lost two of three and 5 of 11 with the pitching and the defense suddenly awol , daulton was asked whether the team can survive on offense alone , impressive as it is we went through this last year , he said but they did n't survive , he was told , as if he had to be reminded fregosi does n't need reminding he admitted that he is thinking hard about the shortstop situation and will probably turn to a third starter in three games when the mets show up tomorrow night whether kim batiste can outdo duncan or bell remains to be seen but , the manager said bluntly , somebody , sooner or later , has to step forward and take the position 'we 'll tough it out' so it is that the mets will probably find the phillies a little bit cranky and concerned they certainly were less than content , even after today s victory for , as more than one phillie pointed out , they could have taken four from the vulnerable expos , but were happy just to get the two victories i think we 're a little flat at times when we should n't be , said daulton we 're in a grind right now we are , agreed dave hollins , but we 'll tough it out and we 'll be all right we do n't play until tomorrow night that will give us some time and , reminded the third baseman , it should be remembered who won and who lost today no matter how tired , how bruised and battered the phillies appeared , hollins had but one thing to say believe me , this is better than being on the other side after this game , he said

washington , april 20 the federal bureau of investigation had no recent evidence that children were being beaten in the branch davidian compound , fbi director william s sessions said today the director s remarks contradicted assertions by president clinton and attorney general janet reno that escalating child abuse had been a major reason to assault the complex near waco , tex , on monday mr sessions s comments were part of a sometimes confused effort by the clinton administration , in the face of considerable public secondguessing , to present a coherent rationale for deciding to fire gas into the complex officials believe that 86 people died in the flames that began after the fbi used armored tanks equipped with ramming prods that pumped tear gas through holes punched in the walls of the compound on monday , ms reno said her fears about recent reports of child abuse were high among the factors driving the timing and tactics of the operation the president s grief president clinton said today that ms reno emphasized the threat of child abuse in seeking his approval sunday for her plan to fire gas into the compound on monday we did everything we could to avoid the loss of life , the president said they made the decision to immolate themselves , and i regret it terribly , and i feel awful about the children but even as the president was speaking today , ms reno s spokesman as well as mr sessions and other fbi officials were backing away from specific charges of recent child abuse , saying that the decision to attack was the result of a mix of many factors seen as measured step the officials said that they had viewed their plan as a measured step to intensify the pressure against david koresh , the cult leader whom they viewed as a dangerous outlaw who had treated their efforts to negotiate with contempt they had concluded that mr koresh was never going to voluntarily surrender and had no choice but to intervene to break the stalemate based on what the officials said it seemed clear today that , in their minds , the standoff was a confrontation between the law and heavilyarmed killers who had slain four federal agents a situation that demanded urgent attention it was not in the nature of the law enforcement officials , who had seen the federal agents killed during the initial raid on feb 28 , to let the cult go on with its way of life these people had thumbed their noses at law enforcement , said larry potts , the assistant director of the fbi s criminal division outpaced by events \? but the administration s effort to explain itself today was often far less clear the discrepancy over how much information officials had about child abuse in the compound left president clinton seemingly unaware that other officials were backpedaling on the extent to which reports of abuse had motivated the decision president clinton said today that he had been told by ms reno of recent childabuse reports on sunday , the day before the assault mr clinton said in part in the end , the last comment i had from janet reno is when i and i talked to her on sunday i said , 'now , i want you to tell me once more why you believe not why they believe why you believe we should move now rather than wait some more' and she said it s because of the children they have evidence that those children are still being abused , and that they 're in increasingly unsafe conditions , and that they do n't think it will get any easier with time , with the passage of time prepared for mass suicide \? but as they were briefing reporters about the events that led to monday s fiery conclusion of the 51day standoff , mr sessions and mr potts both said there was no contemporaneous information of child abuse or baby beatings to justify the assault , although the department had older evidence that some children may have been abused by mr koresh , and there were other legitimate reasons for applying tear gas officials provided contradictory accounts of whether the fbi had adequately prepared for a mass suicide bureau officials insisted today that none of the experts inside and outside the agency had thought that a mass suicide was probable , although they said such a possibility had never been fully discounted they also said that while they had managed to put small listening devices inside the compound , the devices had yielded only fragmentary and inconclusive information about mr koresh and the conditions inside the complex long saturday meeting ms reno decided to approve the bureau s plan on saturday evening , after a long meeting in her office with senior aides who had been euphoric and relieved over the verdicts earlier in the day in the rodney king beating case she had been given the plan on monday , april 12 , and according to justice department and fbi officials , had agonized over it before giving her approval carl stern , the justice department s spokesman , said today that fears over the safety of the children had been a major factor in ms reno s decision to approve the action there were probably half a dozen different factors , said mr stern , but the one that drove her the most was her concern about the children

greenville , sc , oct 8 in the 1920 s , after shoeless joe jackson and seven of his chicago white sox teammates were barred from the major leagues for their involvement in a bribery plot to throw the 1919 world series , jackson settled in this piedmont city in northwestern south carolina , just a regular guy running a liquor store you saw him every day , remembered leo hill , 66 , a greenville lawyer who grew up in the neighborhood where jackson s store was situated we all knew he was basically illiterate , and we did n't want to embarrass him by asking for his autograph now they wish they had with only about six examples of jackson s signature known to exist , the autograph of the white sox outfielder is considered one of the most valuable in the world one of his signatures , ripped from a lease he signed in 1936 , was sold at sotheby s , the manhattan auction house , for 23 , 100 in march 1991 now the american heart association and the american cancer society , the heirs of jackson s widow , katie , are fast on the heels of yet another jackson signature his will in an unusual lawsuit , the two charity groups are suing judge diane smock of greenville county probate court and the county itself to obtain the will they contend it was jackson s personal property , which was left to mrs jackson when he died in 1951 , and now it belongs to them the charities say they want to sell the will and use the proceeds for medical research , as mrs jackson specified in her will when she died in 1959 , she left the two charities about 60 , 000 and said she wanted her assets liquidated and the money used for research on heart failure , which killed her husband , and cancer , which killed her the couple had no children rules are in dispute judge smock has declined to hand over the will , saying the south carolina supreme court , which oversees the operations of the state courts , requires that wills be kept for 75 years but mr hill , who with his son gary is representing the two charity groups , said the rules do not specify that the original be kept it is n't a government document , mr hill said if you go to file your deed , you get your deed back their position just does n't make sense to me , and to deprive these agencies of the funds for medical research in violation of the terms of the will is wholly unnecessary judge smock said releasing the will would be really bad public policy her office stores wills in perpetuity , with those more than 100 years old sent to columbia for storage at the state archives department they are very useful for all kinds of research , not just genealogical but also sociological ownership of land , she said the whole ebb and flow of the country can be traced back but alan medlin , a law professor at the university of south carolina who specializes in probate and estate law , said the recordkeeping requirements of the courts are written in a way that is ambiguous on whether a copy or the original must be retained none of the rules say who owns the document , he said it will be up to a court to decide joseph jefferson jackson was born into poverty in pickens county , sc , in 1889 , and stormed his way into baseball s olympian ranks with mighty swings of black betsy , his signature black bat in 13 years in the major leagues he had a lifetime batting average of 356 , still the third best in baseball , behind only ty cobb s 367 and rogers hornsby s 358 jackson usually refused to sign baseballs for his fans , but on rare occasions he would tell them to pick up the balls the next day then he would have his wife sign them among the existing jackson originals are his 1919 and 1920 white sox contracts but his career ended in 1921 after judge kenesaw mountain landis , who had just been appointed as the first commissioner of baseball , barred jackson and his seven teammates on charges of purposely losing the 1919 world series to the cincinnati reds , five games to three in later years he recanted his part in the black sox scandal , pointing to his 375 batting average in the series but in testimony before a grand jury in september 1920 , jackson , who played left field in the series , said , when a cincinnati player would bat a ball out in my territory , i 'd muff it if i could shaky but valuable scrawl the effort to obtain jackson s will for the two charity groups began about a year ago , when mr hill read a newspaper article about the high price paid for jackson s shaky scrawl at the sotheby s auction mr hill , who wrote mrs jackson s will , had already been working with the charities to increase the value of the estate by marketing merchandise with a shoeless joe theme posters , cards , replicas of the legendary black betsy the curtis management group , an indianapolis concern that also represents the heirs of babe ruth and lou gehrig , handles the licensing to manufacturers quinn neal , the heart association s executive director in south carolina , said his group and the cancer society had each collected about 10 , 000 from the enterprise so far it dawned on me that somebody s going to go in there and steal that will , and if there is some value it would be nice to get it into medical research , mr hill said he immediately called judge smock , who with equal haste retrieved the will from storage it s now under lock and key , she said photos from baseball s olympian ranks to a regular guy running a liquor store shoeless joe jackson , left , is shown as an outfielder for the chicago white sox and buying ice cream for young admirers in 1948

it would be easy to read too little into the clinton administration s quick approval of oregon s plan to reform its medicaid program health and human services secretary donna shalala says her approval reflects president clinton s desire to foster state experimentation and her own attitude toward resolving technical difficulties but there s more to her quick approval than state flexibility and technical competence it signals an understanding that health care reform controlling costs while covering the uninsured is about drawing lines and making choices some americans will get more , others will wind up with less making choices is what oregon has done for its poor it s what mr clinton will propose for everyone else when he releases his national reform plan this spring oregon s legislators , with remarkable harmony , decided to change the way medical coverage for the poor was rationed rather than providing extensive medical coverage for only some of the poor the choice other states make it would provide limited coverage for every poor person the plan ranks about 700 medical procedures according to their effectiveness depending on how many procedures can be financed from its medicaid budget , the state will draw a line paying for every procedure above the line but none below initially oregon will underwrite the first 568 procedures thereby excluding , for example , treatment of common colds and infectious mononucleosis before the plan could go into effect , oregon needed washington s approval for changes in medicaid coverage explicit rationing makes many americans squirm , but oregon s choice was reasonable and deserved a fair testing instead the bush administration rejected the plan last summer , asserting with scant explanation that it discriminated against the disabled but oregon said then , and proved yesterday , that it was willing and able to resolve legitimate problems there are clear overlaps between the oregon plan and the upcoming clinton plan oregon will require employers to provide health insurance to employees the clinton plan is likely to do something similar oregon will require employers to provide health benefits at least as generous as the medicaid coverage at the center of mr clinton s reform will be the choice of a basic benefits package to which every american will be entitled and that the government will subsidize for the poor but while the similarities are large , so are the differences by its approval of the medicaid changes , the clinton administration is not embracing the form of oregon s employer mandate or its approach to rationing indeed , the task force drawing up the administration s plan has yet to settle many of these politically charged problems if oregon s specific solutions are an imperfect guide to the nation s future , the political process is a model worth replicating democrats and republicans forged a consensus , in part because deliberations were open and every group for example , the disabled made its mark on the final legislation by contrast , the task force drawing up mr clinton s plan remains closed to public scrutiny even the identity of task force members has been kept secret leading this week to demotion of one member when it became clear that his stock ownership and affiliation with healthcare companies created embarrassing conflict of interest problems oregon proved that openness is the key to public support a lesson the clinton administration would do well to absorb
athens , ga mismatched pots of begonias and petunias hang from old porches that could use some work painted chicken feeders blossom with zinnias and red salvia these yards have no grass because they are swept clean with a broom made of dogwood branches gathered in the woods they do n't look like much at first glance but hidden in their unconscious design are traces of west africa and the emergence of a hardwon independence blacks here , descendants of slaves brought mainly from west africa to work the cotton fields in georgia s hard clay , are carrying on the traditions that their ancestors brought from the gold coast everything from cooking and washing outdoors to sharing the latest gossip under a shade tree but these yards and the life they hold are fast disappearing , as the people who have long tended them grow old and their children move on center of the home the design of these yards a church pew under the trees , an old bedspring gate on the hog pen , a clump of irises blooming out of a chimney foundation is the evolution of generations of making do and making art out of what others call junk and the swept yard was the most important room of the household , the heart of the home slave quarters were cramped and hot so you washed and cooked outside , and when the meal was over , everything could be swept into the fire sixteen years ago , when richard westmacott , an englishman , came to athens to teach landscape architecture at the university of georgia , he and his wife , jean , moved into an abandoned precivil war house in rural oglethorpe county , about 20 miles east of town in visiting the gardens of his neighbors , he realized , like some latterday de tocqueville , that what the local people took for granted was the embodiment of a fastdisappearing culture i have no doubt that the swept yard did come from africa and then was adopted by white folks , said mr westmacott , whose book , africanamerican gardens and yards in the rural south , was published last year by the university of tennessee almost everybody had swept yards , including the plantations , which were swept by slaves or servants a garden in these parts , by the way , is where you grow vegetables a yard is for your flowers and shrubs people swept their yards long before the age of mowers , and nobody liked grass any weed was called grass , mr westmacott said and people battled against it because cotton did n't compete well with weeds making do , successfully on a hot summer s day in july , lucille sanders stood in her bare feet on the cool , swept dirt , under the shade of pine trees , where the late afternoon light cast cathedrallike shadows on the ground i just put up 25 quarts of string beans and 20 quarts of tomatoes , said mrs sanders , a trim woman of 70 with short white curls she was giving a little tour of her swept yard we ai n't gonna have no corn the drought got it she stared at the sunbleached boards of an empty barn me and my husband built this 28 years ago , she said cut the pine trees , hauled them to a sawmill for the lumber we used to have four or five cows , but we got rid of those a couple years ago we could n't raise the feed for them they used to have hogs , too had a little old pit over there where we 'd scald them and clean them , she said four mens , me and my daughter a hog was not just a hog to an enslaved african it was a corner on life itself what distinguished a good slave owner from a bad one was things like whether or not you were allowed to keep a hog or chickens , mr westmacott said so every hog raised , or row of beans planted after working from dawn to dusk in the master s field , was a scrap of independence mrs sanders s six children helped make syrup from sugar cane and raised wheat and corn to be ground into flour and cornmeal at the mill everybody pitched in in those days if a family reunion was coming up , we 'd go from one house to another , cleaning up , she said we 'd help kill the hogs and get the crops in i liked that life i wish something like that would happen now it seems like people do n't eat together no more changing times but it was that sense of community that helped people to survive slavery and sharecropping , the ravages of the boll weevil and drought mrs sanders s husband , ed , had a stroke a few years back , so now he spends afternoons on the porch with a few of his 14 grandchildren they often visit from town but none of them wants to farm it s the same story all over oglethorpe county the pens that once held animals for food and work , the old hoists and sawedoff oil drums used for scalding the hogs , the wellheads where the women cooked and made soap they all now have the abandoned , neglected look of ghost towns onceproductive vegetable gardens are full of pokeweed and thistle mr westmacott s book , which examines the traditions and folk art of these black gardeners , is the result of his travels through rural georgia , alabama and south carolina his photographs capture a society that is fast disappearing , as children move to the cities for work and buy their vegetables at the supermarket his book also includes photographs of villages in west africa , taken at the turn of the century and preserved in british archives , that show striking similarities to the swept yards of the south swept yards are so familiar to some that they have become invisible

paris tony rominger is man , not computer , right \? definitely he laughs , he sings , he pays his taxes and goes on vacation , he feels pleasure and pain especially when somebody with the wrong access code tries to interface his microchip no , no , no , oh , that s not right , rominger protests look at me , he commands with a laugh i'm a human just like you the rest of this report from mainframe xv672 follows rominger , a 32yearold swiss who ranks second among the world s leading bicycle racers , has a reputation for being programmed for victory by his sports doctor just pop in the floppy disk , people say , and rominger will do the rest despite his insistence that he is flesh and blood , he sometimes makes it sound otherwise after triumphing in the tour of the basque country this winter , for example , he retreated to the training hills near his taxhaven home in monaco and announced that he would not race again until the liegebastogneliege classic , which was then some weeks off by then i will be perfectly programmed to win , he said in french , one of several languages he speaks in fact , he was close , finishing second in a sprint at the end of the long and demanding oneday race success in spain somewhat stolid and deadpan , rominger is a rarity in the sport in predicting victory he also forecast his second successive victory in may in the vuelta a espana , the sport s thirdranked stage , or multiday , race he is less optimistic about his chances in the tour de france , saying only that he hopes to make it onto one of the three steps of the victory podium when the race finishes in paris on july 25 far back in the field after friday s stage , rominger stood 91st over all , 4 minutes 52 seconds behind the leader , mario cipollini of italy rominger will know more about his chances after monday s individual time trial , the tour s first major shakeout then come the alps , another testing ground he does not seem to be worried after all , rominger is under the care of an italian sports doctor who lays out a program that the rider follows like a , well , machine the essence of the program is to spend less time racing and more time preparing to race , reversing the conventional wisdom that says races are the best training you look at my program , i do n't do so many races like other riders , rominger confirmed in an interview this week i go home and prepare for races i do n't go to races for training , i go to races to win that s the difference between me and the others following his victory in the vuelta , rominger got with the program by spending a month at high altitude , training and building up his red corpuscles , which carry oxygen to the muscles not many riders would throw away a month of their racing season , but off rominger went to vail , colo , accompanied by his family and his doctor , michele ferrari i enjoyed colorado very much , the swiss rider said the weather was n't so good , too much snow still , but the people were nice good training , too i know me very well i'm riding such a long time i know what kind of training i have to do do n't cross sponsors when he returned , he rode a leisurely tour of switzerland , skipping any further work , including the swiss championship , but only because his spanish team s sponsor , clas a dairy cooperative did not enjoy the prospect of having its name subordinated on the red jersey with a white cross of the swiss champion the possibility of a rominger loss was not written into the software this general confidence in rominger s strength is one reason he is rated among miguel indurain s main rivals in the tour de france only indurain , who is seeking his third successive victory in the tour and who is the overwhelming favorite in monday s time trial , surpasses rominger in the computerized standing of professional bicycle racers another reason rominger s chances seem to be high is that , if he is not quite the powerful time trialist indurain is , the swiss is considered to be a stronger climber the tour s two days in the alps and three days in the pyrenees will offer many opportunities to gain time on the spaniard finally , not having ridden the tour since 1990 , when greg lemond won , and the giro d'italia since 1989 , rominger has not been humiliated by indurain , who has won both races twice in the last two years therefore , unlike gianni bugno and claudio chiappucci , italian rivals and the two most virulent carriers of the disease , the swiss does not have an indurain complex andy hampsten , the fine american climber with motorola , defines the complex people would rather be beaten by the same guy as be beaten by different people i think the italians do accept that indurain is going to win and they 're used to that , so they 'd rather indurain win again than their rival does same three names both in the tour and the giro , bugno and chiappucci have shared the final victory podium with indurain , who stood on the highest step none of the three has competed recently in the vuelta , which is distant in prestige to the french and italian races rominger sounds respectful but not awed by indurain s record between us we have won all the major tours for the last two years , rominger likes to point out , a little like the corner grocer boasting that he and john d rockefeller have 12 billion in the bank between them nevertheless , rominger has proved that he can win races , including parisnice in 1991 and tirrenoadriatico in 1990 and 1989 , plus such prestigious classics as the tour of lombardy in 1992 and 1989 , and the timetrial finale of the world cup in 1991 the first two are run in the winter , the second two in the fall , which underlines rominger s lack of results thus far in the tour de france the french race is always run in july , and rominger suffers from hay fever in the summer , although now the problem is said to be under control before it was , he finished 63d in the 1988 tour and 57th in 1990 , skipping all other participation in the tour since he turned professional in 1986 he has ridden for teams in italy , france and now spain , adding language skills in those countries to his native german , his careful english and the danish he learned from his mother another problem with the tour s summer date is that , unlike most racers , rominger much prefers the cold , and even the rainy cold , to heat so far the tour has been moving clockwise around france under blue skies and a sweltering sun the heat will be a problem the first

to the editor your article on the tumbling values of coo apartments \( coop bargains a gamble that can pay off , june 17 \) makes many good points but stops short of making one final fundamental insight the coop apartment structure is for most people a terrible form of ownership of real estate this is part of the reason why values of coope apartments are tumbling for most coop apartment owners , the benefits of indirectly controlling one s neighbors are outweighed by the agony of having to deal with a board of directors and the uncertainty of having to rely on all the other shareholders to carry their share of the burden coop apartments violate three basic rules of real estate control your destiny , keep it simple and do n't assume other people will do what they say they will none of this was a problem as long as values kept rising in today s real estate depression , however , it is very much a problem , for all the reasons discussed in your article and many more condominiums simply work better than coops this is part of the reason they have held their value better \( although , because so much of the theoretical value of a coop apartment is counterbalanced by its fixed share of the underlying mortgage , you probably overstate the relative strength of condominiums \) owners of coop apartments should consider trying to convert their buildings into condominiums this is not an easy process , but it is not impossible and it can be made easier first , the state should enact streamlined and simplified disclosure requirements , so that when the shareholders of a coop building decide as a group that they want to free their building and themselves from coop jail , they can do so without generating the voluminous disclosure documentation required by existing law \( in retrospect , all this documentation has not done a great job of protecting people from the pitfalls of coop ownership \) second , the state should enact a simplified and streamlined procedure to convert a building from coop to condominium ownership this procedure could , among other things , require a specified vote of shareholders , make available a reasonable and standardized condominium regime that the parties could vary from if they wished , and otherwise simplify and clarify the process of converting from cooperative to condominium ownership third , the state and city should expressly exempt these conversions from all real estate transfer taxes \( not just exempt them by implication , as is probably the case today \) and from any mortgage recording tax that would otherwise apply for some buildings , these three changes would be enough to facilitate conversion from cooperative to condominium ownership for most buildings , however , a cooptocondo conversion would also need to deal with two other major obstacles the underlying mortgage and the unsold shares for apartments that are occupied by rentregulated tenants and hence of virtually no value in many cases these last two areas may require creative legislation , including bank regulatory measures , careful use of the condemnation power , stateassisted financing , and changes in rent regulation once we decide it makes sense to encourage buildings to convert from cooperative to condominium status , however , we ought to be able to find practical solutions to these problems the time has come to recognize that the coop structure is a terribly flawed way to own real estate cooperative apartment shareholders should seriously consider trying to convert to a condominium structure and , to promote the stability and desirability of apartment ownership in new york city , the state and city governments should begin looking very seriously at what they can do to help buildings convert from cooperative to condominium ownership joshua stein goldens bridge , ny the writer was a board member of an upper west side coop for three years
judging by his budget presentation , r james woolsey , president clinton s chief spymaster , seems well on his way to becoming a captive of the oldboy bookkeepers in the intelligence agencies mr clinton , who needs to save every dollar he can , would be a sucker to let that happen the immediate issue is the annual intelligence budget of 29 billion the larger issue is whether america needs an intelligence apparatus of cold war dimensions mr woolsey told the house intelligence committee that he could absorb a 1 billion cut in next year s budget but not much more a snub of mr clinton s campaign pledge to find 75 billion in cuts over five years precipitous cuts , mr woolsey warned , will cripple us in the long run it s understandable that a new president might waver when faced with the mysteries , political connections and massed inertia of the national security mandarins but it defies common sense , with no soviet threat in prospect , to believe that the intelligence agencies ca n't make do with less than 28 billion intelligence costs reached a peak of nearly 31 billion in 1990 they 've dropped only 19 billion since then , even though fully half the 31 billion was aimed at a threat that has now largely evaporated of course there are other dangers but are they so menacing that none of the remaining 13 billion once directed at the soviet threat can be cut from the intelligence budget \? senator daniel patrick moynihan , for one , believes that deep cuts are both possible and feasible the congressional budget office suggests cuts yielding fiveyear savings of 188 billion cutting back on satellite reconnaissance might save 3 billion more in the old days , tracking the soviet threat was a fulltime occupation involving an army of spies and analysts who kept their eyes on latin american leftists , soviet submarines , moscow cocktail parties , diplomatic communiques , missile movements and military maneuvers it may make sense to continue some but surely not at the same pace here are some places to cut unnecessary satellites the national security agency spends 4 billion a year on bigeared satellites that monitor everything from telephone conversations to missile telemetry it overhears more than can be transcribed and translated similarly , the national reconnaissance office spends roughly 6 billion a year on eyeinthesky satellite monitoring , at 1 billion a satellite soviet coverage can now be reduced coverage of other targets , like wouldbe nuclear proliferators , can be carried out with fewer satellites tactical intelligence the biggest chunk of the budget , about 11 billion , is spent on tactical intelligence , tracking military movements up to the minute the defense intelligence agency , each of the four armed services and each of 10 military commands has its own tactical intelligence staff redundancy provides some useful alternative assessments and lots of wasteful duplication spies and analysts nobody knows how many spies and analysts there are , but savings are possible here , too the cia has cut its staff of soviet military analysts to 9 from 125 but it has simply shifted the work to the armed services , which are resisting staff cuts beyond normal attrition it s true that the cia will have to keep an eye on places like iran but since the soviet menace was global , the rest of the world was pretty well covered to begin with furthermore , much of what passes for intelligence comes from newspapers , broadcasts and conversations that was true even in the secretive soviet union , with its tightly controlled media such information is inexpensively gathered the diplomatic corps does it every day spies can help , but their value should not be overestimated they cost more than diplomats and , despite the occasional intelligence bonanza , they serve up lots of disinformation too and money does n't guarantee success the intelligence community had plenty when it failed to predict the shah of iran s overthrow and the soviet union s collapse what mr clinton and mr woolsey face is a deeply entrenched culture that feeds off what it can identify as a menace they should not let themselves be spooked beneath the veil of secrecy is a bloated budget that can be safely cut
foxfire confessions of a girl gang by joyce carol oates 328 pages dutton a william abrahams book 21 norman mailer once observed that most writers have a handful of ideas , and that they spend their careers reinventing these same ideas over and over again certainly this has been true of joyce carol oates and her everexpanding oeuvre though her 20odd novels have embraced a variety of genres \( from the gothic romance to the postmodern detective story , from the contemporary family saga to the behindtheheadlines novel \) , though they have examined different classes and have taken place in different centuries , they have all shared a preoccupation with certain recurrent themes the violence and unpredictability of american life the undercurrents of guilt , passion and jealousy that run beneath the seemingly placid surface of daily life the role that fate and simple accidents play in the shaping of ordinary lives ms oates s latest novel foxfire is no exception like them \( 1969 \) , you must remember this \( 1987 \) and because it is bitter , and because it is my heart \( 1990 \) , the novel focuses on a girl s \( in this case , several girls' \) sexual and emotional coming of age like those earlier books , the novel juxtaposes scenes of gothic horror the gang rape of a dwarf woman in a remote farmhouse , the kidnapping and murder of a wealthy businessman with more mundane descriptions of everyday life this time around , however , the results feel oddly strained and contrived the intimate sense of emotional relationships found in these previous books by ms oates has been replaced by a more detached , schematic rendering of lives running out of control as a consequence , the central characters seem less like fleshandblood individuals than like predictable stereotypes maddy , the narrator of foxfire , is now a middleaged woman , recounting her memories of belonging to a girl gang named foxfire her account takes place in the 1950 s in a small upstate new york town at the age of 14 , maddy became foxfire s official historian she was the nice girl in the gang , the one who got good grades in school and who ultimately declined to participate in the gang s more outrageous schemes margaret \( or legs as she was known \) was the bad girl in the gang , the daring ringleader and provocateur , who dreamed up the group s bizarre initiation rites and its criminal scams for making money she served time in the red bank state correctional facility for stealing a car and pulling a knife at school , and she preached to the other girls a hodgepodge credo of marxist class warfare and feminist liberation foxfire s other members included rita , the school s favorite scapegoat and victim , who was teased and molested by the neighborhood boys until foxfire avenged her sufferings , and violet , a beautiful , boycrazy girl , who became one of the gang s most fervent members in its earliest incarnation , foxfire served as a kind of defense committee , committed to protecting and avenging its members acting together in secret , the girls humiliated a teacher who had tried to take advantage of rita , and succeeded in driving him from town the girls also exposed and embarrassed another man , who had tried to extract sexual favors from maddy as time passed , the gang began to extrapolate its anger from particular men to men as a species to raise money , the girls began a game of hooking that is , they 'd flirt with men they had met in a bar , a bus station , a hotel the minute one of them responded with a proposition , the girls would hold him up for money by revealing that they were underage one foxfire motto , maddy recalls , was men are the enemy ! this hectoring tone gradually infects the entire novel , turning the story of maddy and legs into a clumsy allegory about the victimization of women and their revenge through sisterhood and violence as related by ms oates , none of the encounters between the foxfire girls and the assorted men they meet feel remotely believable in each instance , the men are depicted as cartoon characters , as predatory , sexual beasts intent on preying on young women in each instance , the exchanges between them and the foxfire girls immediately devolve into physical sexual warfare given the fact that foxfire is set in the early 50 s , long before the women s movement colored the vocabulary used to describe the battle between the sexes , the language used by the foxfire girls sounds strangely rhetorical and phony it s a state of undeclared war , says legs , them hating us , men hating us no matter our age or who the hell we are but nobody wants to admit it , not even us with its dramatic ending which depicts a car flying off a bridge foxfire seems to want to be a 50 s version of thelma and louise it wants to be a feminist parable about women refusing to be doormats and seizing control of their lives unfortunately , ms oates s rendering of this story is so contrived and portentous that the reader neither buys her simplistic message nor cares about her fictional creations foxfire is a dud photo of joyce carol oates
dallas , may 28 ross perot s grassroots political organization is in turmoil , riven by disputes that are beginning to cost it some of its mostcommitted volunteers mr perot s personal popularity has never been higher , but morale in his organization , united we stand america , is beginning to sag in many states , including those where mr perot ran strongest in the 1992 presidential election , there are bitter disputes about who will lead the local chapters of the group there is also widespread disagreement over what role the organization should play on the national and local political stages from crusaders to critics some volunteer leaders who were unstinting in their support of mr perot last fall now voice stinging complaints that his dallasbased aides are dictatorial , secretive and duplicitous in their dealings with grassroots workers they also contend that mr perot is more interested in making speeches and television appearances and in signing up new members for the organization than in pushing ahead toward his oftstated goal of forcing local , state and national politicians to exercise fiscal restraint and fend off special interests if they ran a business the way they 're running this thing , they 'd be bankrupt , said cindy schultz , who recently resigned in frustration after serving for nearly a year as state coordinator in wisconsin for united we stand america mood expected to remain orson g swindle 3d , who ran the perot campaign in its final months and helped start the new organization , said the problem is in the inability of the perot staff to hear what the grass roots want to say he encouraged everybody to be heard , and then did n't have the capacity to listen mr swindle , who resigned on dec 3 and has since joined jack f kemp s group , said that while united we stand america might have its problems the movement of dissatisfied voters tapped into last year by mr perot is a political fact those pundits who think this will go away are wrong , he said mr perot insists that the dissonance in united we stand america comes from a few malcontents what you have here , he said in an interview with cbs , is a tiny number of people who were in leadership positions at the local level , elected by their peers and for one reason or another , their peers chose other leaders and this tiny number of people go from television show to television show the dissidents contend that as the organization has hired paid state directors , the dallas office has bypassed the more outspoken local leaders and has chosen people who will take orders arguments with headquarters are inevitable in any organization , and should not automatically be grounds for dismissal , they say 'there s no democracy' i thought we lived in a democracy , said gary demott , an early perot volunteer in idaho who has been denied a job in the recast organization and now runs a splinter group called united we stand idaho i was wrong , he added there s no democracy in united we stand america although none of mr perot s advisers will say so , the increasingly public grumbling by oncecommitted perot supporters may have been a major factor in the timing of mr perot s latest televised assault on president clinton the assault effectively shifted attention from complaints within united we state america to the increasingly testy relations between mr perot and mr clinton several dissidents spoke on the nbc program dateline several days ago preparation by abc s nightline for a program that was broadcast a few days ago prompted officials of united we stand america to send a memorandum to state directors urging supporters to call the program s producers and reverse the negative slant soon after , mr perot gave interviews to cbs , nbc , cnn and pbs mr perot s top aides acknowledge the problems but characterize them as the growing pains typical of any new organization maybe we were not as deft as we could have been , but you have to recall that it was a fairly small staff built overnight , said r clay mulford , an original board member of the group noise and attention like mr perot , he contends that the critics represent a tiny but noisy minority who have attracted attention from news organizations by raising the specter of mr perot as an authoritarian kook these are people who know the hot buttons of the organization , mr mulford said they all use the same key words they say , 'it s dictatorial it s naziesque' mr perot won 19 percent of the vote in last year s presidential election , the strongest showing by an independent candidate since theodore roosevelt in 1912 since the election , he is more popular than ever with voters , polls indicate after the election , mr perot recast united we stand america , making it a notforprofit , educational group dedicated to keeping his message and agenda at the forefront of american political life in idaho , one of mr perot s best states last fall , platt thompson , the top perot representative , claims to have signed up 10 , 000 members , give or take a couple of thousand but idaho is one state where the perot organization is in particular turmoil , riven by intramural squabbling , and other perot supporters question that figure it ca n't be more than three or four thousand , at best , said mr demott , who is competing with mr thompson for leadership of the state s perot forces and in arizona , a splinter group is publishing a newsletter it calls united we stand everywhere
roland kohloff , principal timpanist for the new york philharmonic , had such severe depression last spring that he was forced to stop performing i could feel it coming on , he said my chemistry was going out and i was totally helpless you do n't want to get out of bed it s very hard to do anything because his son , who has schizophrenia , had been helped by electroshock therapy , mr kohloff decided to forgo medication and talk therapy , and try a treatment that many people associate with oppressive efforts to control the mentally ill in the 1940 s and 50 s what i think it did was to act like a rotorooter on the depression , said mr kohloff , who at 58 still exudes a bohemian air with his curly beard and longish hair it just reamed me clear and the depression was gone although many people still recoil at the thought of electroshock , associating it with images of frankenstein s monster , the electric chair and bolts of lightning , the treatment has made a discreet comeback in the last decade increasingly , those who have been aided are willing to speak out , describing its benefits and lobbying to make the treatment more widely available and these days , with the treatment practically abandoned in state institutions , those on the receiving end tend to be middleclass and professional more effective , less disturbing electroconvulsive therapy as doctors prefer to call it , since it is the convulsion , not the shock , that is the healing agent has attracted more notice in recent years for two reasons although it carries a risk of memory loss , it remains more effective for treating severe depression than medication , and the procedure itself is much less disturbing than it used to be before the advent of new drugs to treat mental illness in the 1950 s , doctors say , hospitals administered shock treatments too often and for too many diagnoses , without anesthesia \( leaving patients awake \) or muscle relaxants \( often leaving patients with broken bones and lost teeth from the convulsions \) and sometimes , as the american psychiatric association recently put it , the treatments were given even to control troublesome patients now , with modifications like reduced doses of electricity and fewer sessions , the treatment seems almost as routine as a visit to the dentist in fact , a majority of patients said in a recent survey that they considered it less distressing than a trip to the dentist on a hot muggy morning recently at long island jewish medical center s hillside hospital in queens , a 74yearold grandmother and retired bookkeeper , wearing street clothes and makeup , was being prepared for the procedure that doctors hoped would end a depression so severe that she had practically stopped eating after she received muscle relaxants and a mild barbiturate , a doctor applied electrodes to her temples in minutes , she was asleep as it s only a paper moon wafted from a speaker nearby , the doctor pushed a button on a gray box , releasing two seconds of electrical current for about 45 seconds , her arms and legs jerked a few inches up and down her expression did not change doctors expect the seizure visible as much in the wild squiggles on a monitor as in the convulsions , which were muted by the drugs to alter the chemical balance in the woman s brain , ending the depression to be sure , shock therapy is still the most stigmatized of all psychiatric treatments currently in use \( lobotomies are no longer performed \) talk therapy has become so accepted that many people almost seem to brag about it , and more are open about taking medication , but shock therapy is still a source of shame cavett signals a change we commonly treat celebrities , and unfortunately very rarely do they want it known , said dr harold a sackeim , a psychologist who is chief of biological psychiatry at the new york state psychiatric institute in manhattan and an expert on electroconvulsive therapy but that is starting to change this spring , for instance , dick cavett , the talk show host , spoke publicly about the success that electroshock therapy had had in fighting his depression use of electroshock therapy has risen gradually since the early 1970 s one indicator is the number of sessions paid for by medicare , the federal health insurance program for elderly and disabled people in 1986 , 88 , 847 sessions were covered by medicare last year , there were 101 , 854 a patient typically requires 8 to 12 sessions over three weeks from a survey of 22 , 000 americans last year , the national institute of mental health concluded that 110 , 000 people each year undergo electroconvulsive therapy but some experts consider that estimate to be high dr richard d weiner , director of the electroconvulsive therapy program at duke university medical center in durham , nc , put the number at 30 , 000 to 50 , 000 mostly in private hospitals the national alliance for the mentally ill , a leading advocacy organization of families and patients , believes more people could be benefitting from the therapy and last year urged that it be more accessible experts say that virtually all the growth in the treatment has occurred at private hospitals , rather than the public institutions so associated with the therapy in past decades
fort lauderdale , fla , march 6 on a gorgeous day when buck showalter would have rather been solely concerned with mike witt s testing his twice reconstructed elbow against major league hitters for the first time in almost 21 months , there were other topics the yankee manager was forced to tackle showalter and gene michael , the yankees' general manager , suppressed smirks while discussing catcher matt nokes s bizarre comments friday about his value , and , of course , george steinbrenner was attending his first yankee spring game since 1990 and the mets were the opponent just what showalter needed when he wanted to concentrate on witt steinbrenner has often made meaningless games with the mets seem monumental in importance witt made the trying day more bearable for showalter with a respectable performance , allowing one run and four hits in two innings in a 97 yankees victory at fort lauderdale stadium with steinbrenner eschewing his secluded box above the stadium to sit beside the dugout and sign dozens of autographs , witt continued creeping along the comeback trail by inducing two doubleplay balls , walking none and reporting no pain in his fragile right elbow i felt real good about it , said witt there was no discomfort i did n't throw good pitches i threw adequate pitches it s only going to get better still , there is skepticism about witt making it back the last time witt threw a major league pitch was june 13 , 1991 he is in the final year of a threeyear , 8 million contract , and he has thrown five and one third innings since he signed the deal this is witt s last chance to pay dividends on the contract and possibly his last chance to prove he is healthy enough to pitch in the majors relying strictly on fastballs and curveballs , a nervous witt plowed through two innings on 23 pitches and then retreated to the bullpen , where he worked on locating his breaking ball on the outside corner originally , he thought he might return last july , but he developed tendinitis in his elbow , where the ulnar collateral ligament had already been reconstructed , and was forced to stop throwing for three months now witt has been pitching every other day since december and hoping to make the rotation this was like the first step in a long road , witt said actually , the rehabilitation was the first step this is just another step coming out and pitching 30 games , i would consider that an accomplishment the yankees say witt is their no 4 starter if he stays healthy and pitches consisently , but michael also said they are not reserving a roster spot for him absolutely counting on him means that we 're putting him in the rotation , he said i would n't do that yet in springs past , steinbrenner treated games against the mets as if they were world series affairs so he was delighted to see the yankees torch dwight gooden , a tampa , fla , native like steinbrenner , for five runs in the first inning but george was not thrilled when the yankees let a 92 lead dissipate to 97 and let s go mets chants bounced around the stadium the yankees hung tight for the victory , and steinbrenner made a brief appearance in the clubhouse to discuss it just being around this team was fun , said steinbrenner , who will not attend sunday s game against the mets i like the way this team looks even though it s only two games in , i feel good about this team in addition to the mets , showalter also had nokes to worry about nokes created an odd situation by saying friday that he would be the happiest guy in the world if the yankees traded him to the angels or padres and even offered a hypothetical deal for california ace mark langston a valuable power hitter who is considered a belowaverage catcher , nokes seemingly considers himself one of the top catchers in the league so showalter had a meeting with nokes on friday after the player s error , passed ball and botched rundown play against the dodgers he likely told him to temper his comments i think matt is real defensive about things , said showalter , who would not disclose details of the discussion maybe that is rightly so asked about the lopsided langston trade nokes suggested , michael said players do n't know how trades are made he has a high opinion of himself , and that will help him but michael , who is paid to evaluate players , declined to assess nokes defensively and said , we know what we have inside pitch mike stanley clubbed two homers , a single and drove in six runs to power the yankees to their second straight victory bernie williams and the mets' jeff kent also homered general manager gene michael said that the yankees would discuss free agent jack clark but that their interest in the former yankee seems to be limited don mattingly ,

evander holyfield has had to overcome his fear of the ring each time he has stepped between the ropes now , after an eightmonth absence from boxing , he will have to do it again holyfield , who has not fought since losing the heavyweight championship to riddick bowe last november , will take on alex stewart on saturday night in atlantic city in what marks the beginning of an effort to regain the title it is not a fight he needs holyfield , now 30 years of age , is wealthy he has earned 82 million hitting people he has saved much of it and yet , after a retirement that did not last long , he is fighting again when holyfield lost his stirring showdown with bowe , he announced he had had enough he was done with boxing the only trainer he ever had , george benton , left him to take on other fighters so did lou duva , his cotrainer and comanager , who had been with him from the beginning but now holyfield is making his return , and looking ahead to a fight against either bowe , who holds two of the three world titles , or lennox lewis , who holds the one title that bowe does n't i thought after i lost to bowe that it was over for me , holyfield said no more hard training i had put a lot of pressure on myself because of my responsibility to my kids and to others hammer copromoter for return he is divorced and has four children his longtime good friend is the rap performer hammer , who is credited \( or blamed \) for convincing holyfield to return to the ring and hammer is a copromoter of this bout , which will be on payperview television at a suggested price of 2495 when holyfield steps into the ring on saturday night , he will be a little heavier than in the past he weighed 205 pounds when he fought bowe who came in at 235 , and holyfield is expected to weigh at least 215 pounds against stewart that will be the most that the 6foot2inch holyfield has ever weighed for a fight , but it may not be enough to change the minds of oldline purists who have long viewed him as a pumpedup cruiserweight , as a fighter without the natural strength of a legitimate heavyweight as a heavyweight , holyfield has always been different in a sport where training techniques are taken from the same worn pages , and where weightlifting is rare , he has had a body sculptured by nautilus this was something i felt was necessary , he said of his training methods others read by candlelight when there s electricity in the old days , you broke your body down these guys would run on hard cement wearing high boots the great heavyweights that is , the ones who have captured the imagination made their opponents quiver in the locker room before even stepping into the ring they were stalkers like joe louis , or thunderous punchers like rocky marciano , or oneofakind fighters like muhammad ali or menacing machines like mike tyson hightech boxer with 100 , 000 gym holyfield is none of these rather , he is a hightech boxer who began in the 1984 olympic games in the 178pound class he was disqualified in the semifinals when he knocked out his opponent after the referee had ordered the fighters to break and then turned professional four months after the olympics within two years , he had won the world boxing association heavyweight title with a decision over dwight qawi he became so enamored of conditioning that after he became the unified heavyweight champion by defeating buster douglas in 1990 , he built a 100 , 000 gym , housing it next to his milliondollar home in atlanta he visited the gym regularly and used it to good purpose as he fought three successful title defenses then came bowe after holyfield lost , he surprised those who thought they knew him when he announced his decision to return to the ring just weeks after he had announced his retirement i thought about all the things i did n't like about fighting , he said in attempting to explain why he was coming back , and to retire would be a relief but then i thought , hey , i can do what i want to do i realized all the pressure i had always been under had built a foundation conquering the fear holyfield says that he has been afraid of boxing since his first fight as an 8yearold , and that training has always been a way to help conquer that fear but the fear remains and , he suggests , it is a major factor in his return he says he is overcoming something he cannot quite verbalize , some unspoken pressure then again , his real motivation may simply be the sense that , if he could just meet bowe again , he 'd fight a smarter fight i'm coming back not just to fight , but to be the champion again , he said not just to do it if i wanted to just get some boxing in , i could have gone into my own gym and i could have done it at home holyfield claims his new trainer , emanuel steward , is taking him to the next level that assertion insults lou duva , who says he does not understand why holyfield wants to fight again and duva resents holyfield s suggestion that he did n't go as far as he could have

white plains , july 8 westchester county airport , with its battered quonset hut of a terminal and its wildcat parking arrangements , would have made barnstormers , like charles lindbergh , proud but this area s fortune 500 corporate executives and other travelers have long needed something more up to date a modernization that would include a new terminal and a 1 , 069space garage is just now taking off , but it has been caught up in the crosswinds of this county s tangled politics county executive andrew p o'rourke has recommended that the 18 million garage be built and operated by a parking developer whose lawyer , albert j pirro , is the husband of mr o'rourke s republican running mate for district attorney , jeanine pirro the potential for a conflict of interest , critics say , is further complicated by the fact that mr o'rourke is already under investigation by the current district attorney , carl a vergari , for a covey of other possible ethical conflicts , including his efforts to have county contractors hire the woman he lives with , his daughter and his soninlaw questions about impartiality critics of the airport arrangement wonder whether mrs pirro , who recently resigned a county judgeship , would be able as district attorney to continue an impartial investigation of mr o'rourke how can the people of the county expect to get the best deal for themselves when the spouse of the person who is negotiating with the county may be called on to continue an investigation of the county executive \? asked thomas j abinanti , a democratic county legislator from greenburgh the 59yearold mr o'rourke said he believed the investigations into referrals he made for relatives will be resolved before the election he has also produced a written opinion from the county attorney , marilyn j slaatten , that the garage contract does not violate county or state ethics because as district attorney mrs pirro would have no ostensible dealings with the garage besides , mr o'rourke said , the garage contract is not his to authorize but has to be approved by twothirds of the 17member board of legislators , which has scheduled a hearing on the project july 12 i think it s quite a stretch to see this as a conflict for anybody , he said lawyer for parking company the 41yearold mrs pirro said in a statement that she will pursue any investigation vigorously as i have done throughout my career mr pirro , a zoning and development lawyer here and a republican fundraiser , said that if his wife becomes district attorney she would not be swayed by mr o'rourke s role in recommending the firm that mr pirro represents mr pirro represents a joint venture involving apcoa inc , or airport parking corporation of america , an ohiobased developer that operates parking lots at the county airport as well as at airports in albany , rochester and newark , and louis cappelli , a builder in mount pleasant , ny mr pirro said apcoa was chosen because its proposal provided 20 million more to the county than a competing plan mr pirro , who took on the project before his wife announced her candidacy , would not disclose his fee arrangement mr abinanti has noted that when mr pirro represented apcoa in a garage contract at the westchester county medical center , he arranged to receive 10 to 20 percent of any profits over 30 years mr pirro contends there is also risk to such an arrangement if the garage yields no profits he will receive no payments in the district attorney s race , mrs pirro will face one of two democrats , michael g cherkasky , a former investigations chief in the manhattan district attorney s office , or paul pickelle , a former bureau chief in the special state prosecutor s office mr cherkasky said today that the garage contract was further evidence that a small group of republicans control county contracts and that , as a member of that group , mrs pirro would not be able to investigate abuses how can you look at these things hard if there s a builtin conflict when your husband is getting the contract , he said when his wife chose to run , mr pirro asked his lawyer , sylvia l fabriani , whether the garage deal posed any ethical conflicts she said there were none it is possible , however , she wrote , that the public may adversely view the marital relationship in conjunction with the contractual relationship
mexico city , april 13 for almost two years , as the world s fascination with the mexican painter frida kahlo fed a stream of pilgrims to the funny blue house in which she was born and died , visitors there were met by bolted doors and a guard mumbling about repairs angry graffiti appeared on the walls and artists protested in the press but it was the reopening of the 35yearold frida kahlo museum late last month that ignited the smoldering dispute over the management of the legacy that kahlo and her husband , diego rivera , left in trust to the mexican people artists , critics and intellectuals have been demanding to know how it could have taken two years to repaint the museum , fix one of its walls and install an alarm system that seems to go off every time someone inside the museum moves their broader question is this how is it that the president of the steering committee of the diego rivera trust , a wealthy former model and patron of rivera s , has managed to gain control of a large collection of rivera and kahlo art , papers and belongings that is supposed to belong to all of mexico \? he did not have money , the woman , dolores olmedo , said of rivera and i did perched on a sofa in the sitting room of her walled 10acre estate on mexico city s southern edge , miss olmedo was explaining why , after kahlo s death in 1954 , rivera asked her to buy the largest private collection of kahlo s paintings she paid 20 , 000 pesos , she said , then the equivalent of 1 , 600 if it were not for my private collection , frida kahlo would not be known to the world , miss olmedo said that she kept the works in the private gallery at her estate rather than in the kahlo museum , as she apparently promised rivera , has been questioned occasionally by art historians but with kahlo s transformation in recent years from an obscure , secondary artist into a pop icon , the question has become one of patrimony artists say the kahlo works have been withheld from public view except when miss olmedo has shown them abroad some art historians complain that a trove of rivera s personal papers remains either sealed or secreted , years after the artist \( who died in 1957 \) specified that they should be made public and assorted critics say the refurbishing of the kahlo museum is only the latest episode to suggest that miss olmedo runs the trust virtually as a personal enterprise everyone in this country is very afraid of her , said rivera s only surviving daughter , guadalupe rivera marin , who long ago gave up any involvement in her father s trust because of what she described as miss olmedo s feudal control over it she has been very friendly with all of the presidents , and all of them let her do as she wishes some blame the bank of mexico , the country s central bank , for failing to assert itself as the fiduciary of the trust rivera set up to administer both the kahlo museum and the nearby anahuacalli , a museum built to house his large collection of prehispanic art \( a third museum , in rivera s former studio in mexico city , is run separately by the national institute of fine arts \) and there are those who say the heart of the problem lies in a rivalry that miss olmedo , now believed to be in her early 80 s , continues to feel toward kahlo , the intense , suffering figure who was the most important woman among the many in rivera s womanizing life dolores olmedo kept the museum closed for two years because she wanted to , because she has a passionate hatred for frida , said jesusa rodriguez , a leading avantgarde theater director who was born a few blocks from kahlo s house i do n't think she has ever pardoned frida for being the true woman of diego s life miss olmedo , who has steadfastly defended her handling of the kahlo museum , did so again in an interview just after it reopened she dismissed her critics as envious meddlers , but offered little explanation why the modest refurbishing took so long to complete bankers unavailable a spokesman for the bank of mexico initially referred all questions about the trust to miss olmedo , saying that under mexican law its details were secret the spokesman , eduardo turrent diaz , said the only bank officials who could discuss the trust were out of town and unavailable the trust patrimony is inventoried in its entirety , mr turrent added , and is kept in its entirety on the grounds of the museum to those expecting the international obsession with kahlo and her work to wane , the uproar over la casa azul , where she lived with rivera , might prompt a reconsideration the museum holds only a smattering of the artist s work , and none of her most important paintings but its collection of artifacts from the kahlo mythology the mirrored canopy bed in which she painted selfportaits while recovering from her countless surgeries , her favorite traditional mexican dresses , the oddshaped patio on which her monkey roamed , the portraits of her heroes like malenkov and mao have made it an almost sacred place for the legions of kahlo s posthumous fans
london , aug 18 europe is mired in recession its efforts to forge a single currency are in tatters unemployment is high and rising crucial industries like automobiles and steel are struggling but if this is supposed to be a summer of gloom for europe , nobody bothered to tell the stock markets stock market bulls , in fact , are stampeding as if through the streets of pamplona investors here , as well as from the united states , japan and other parts of the world , seem to be pouring money into stocks in the belief that interest rates across the continent are about to begin a steady decline , a development that would help speed economic recovery and improve the prospects of european industry at the same time , the prospect of lower interest rates is leading many investors to pull their money out of savings accounts and bonds and to seek higher returns in stocks a widespread upswing after languishing much of the year , shares in london , europe s financial capital , have been surging , hitting another alltime high today in germany , whose economic problems have been dragging down the rest of the continent , shares on the frankfurt stock exchange jumped sharply today to reach their highest level in three years share prices were also up in paris and in most other european financial centers in stockholm , shares rose a startling 286 percent to a record level market indexes were at or near annual or alltime highs in denmark , finland , italy , spain and the netherlands , among other markets the surge in europe also helped stocks in the united states today , where the dow jones industrial average closed above the 3 , 600 level for the first time page d6 the theory behind the belief that european interest rates will fall is that the continent s governments have more freedom now to cut rates since the effective collapse of the european monetary system at the end of july under the system , most large european nations were committed to maintaining stable currency values because germany has been keeping its rates high to stave off inflation arising from its reunification , other nations were forced to keep their rates high or see their currencies plummet in value against the german mark but when a tidal wave of speculation swamped the french franc last month , it forced the european governments to let their currencies fluctuate more widely in value with no need to maintain stable exchange rates , there is no longer a requirement for france and other european nations to match germany s high rates the belief is that we 've now got the prospect of significantly lower rates to fuel recovery in europe , said mike young , the director of european investment strategy at merrill lynch in london freed from their exchangerate shackles , european nations are now expected by economists to begin concentrating on bolstering their domestic economies and addressing the daunting problem of unemployment that is afflicting them all the model is britain , which was forced out of the exchange rate mechanism in the currency crisis of last september , went on to slash its base lending rate to 6 percent from 10 percent , and is now enjoying the strongest economic growth in europe along with falling unemployment investors in the european stock markets , looking ahead to next year , now see the same rebound in store for other nations , including germany and france in london , the financial timesstock exchange index of 100 leading shares closed up 486 points , or 161 percent , at 3 , 07360 in frankfurt , the dax index closed at 1 , 93572 , up 2555 points , or 134 percent in paris , the cac40 index was up 2446 points , to 2 , 16075 , a rise of 114 percent some notes of skepticism but some analysts and economists said they had doubts as to whether the market would prove an accurate predictor of economic recovery , and some said investors might be overly sanguine about europe s prospects for overcoming its economic woes certainly there s nothing to suggest that the economies are about to leap to life in the way the stock markets are indicating , said warren oliver , an economist at s g warburg securities in london there is still a disparity , or a contrast if you like , between the strength of the recovery that the stock market as a leading indicator would suggest and any other sign of economic rebound on the continent , mr oliver said the best you can say about the continent is that the recession may be bottoming out germany , for example , is a long way from the recovery that its stock markets are anticipating the organization for economic cooperation and development , the economic research group financed by the large industrial nations , said today that the outlook for germany remained gloomy in contrast to the german government , which last week predicted economic growth next year of 15 percent in the western part of the country after a 15 percent decline this year , the organization predicted growth of just 1 percent next year after a decline of 25 percent this year unemployment in western germany , the organization said , would rise to 95 percent next year from 75 percent in july french outlook is uncertain there is also some question about the assumption that rates will fall quickly and substantially , especially in france , which was seen as the primary beneficiary of the weakening of the monetary system s strictures although france has pushed down some of its shortterm rates , it has not cut its benchmark lending rates , and a debate continues within the government over whether to pursue growth and let the franc decline further in value indeed , currency trading today indicated that dealers were not convinced that european rates would fall soon the dollar s value fell against most european currencies after comments by british and german officials indicating they were content with the current level of interest rates none of the caveats , however , seem to have made much of an impression on the stock markets sushil wadhwani , a european equity strategist at goldman sachs international in london , said that if the recovery did not begin as investors hoped , then governments would continue to lower interest rates , as the united states did when confronted with a balky recovery over the last few years that would keep the markets happy ,

two researchers who studied schools in nassau county find that with few exceptions the smaller the school districts , the whiter and wealthier they are and the more money they spend per student , with less tax effort the researchers , drs walter mathews , university dean of academic affairs at long island university , and donald weinstein , associate professor of educational leadership and administration at c w post college , conducted their study , a closer look at long island s public schools , as an outgrowth of their interest in the consolidation of school districts and equity in financing , two issues that have received widespread attention on long island , dr weinstein said , many people are concerned that the public schools are spending more to teach fewer students and getting declining results in our study we were looking for truths other studies have analyzed the districts , but the new work may be the first totally objective analysis , dr weinstein said , adding that it had no political motivation nor any intent to draw conclusions gov mario m cuomo has been trying for years to change the formula for state aid to school districts , particularly on long island , which he feels receives disproportionately more money than other districts in the state generally , republicans in the state senate , led by the majority leader , ralph j marino of oyster bay , have blocked efforts to reduce the aid in addition , former assemblyman arthur j kremer , in a study of schools on the island , recommended that a number of districts be consolidated , to save money that recommendation has come under fire on the island from administrators , school boards and others as largely unworkable ranges by category the study by the two long island university researchers found ranges , or disparities , like these size from east rockaway , with 1 , 100 students , to east meadow with 7 , 200 taxable property value per student from 139 , 000 in roosevelt to 13 million in oyster bayeast norwich expenditures per student from 8 , 056 in roosevelt to 15 , 911 in jericho student populations from 05 percent white in hempstead to 974 white in massapequa proportion of revenue from local property taxes from a low of 286 percent in roosevelt to 88 in great neck light taxes , unmericful taxes the disparities found among the 56 districts were extreme , with disproportionate totals being spent on students one of the most startling findings was that conventional ideas about spending by wealthy districts were not borne out , dr mathews said , adding the top 10 school districts spend the largest amount of money to educate their students by taxing themselves lightly , while the districts at the low end tax themselves unmercifully to achieve small amounts of money this is because their tax base is so low that no matter how much they spend in attempt to equalize schooldstrict financing , there s no way they can our findings showed us that change is long overdue the researchers did not measure output factors like scores on the scholastic aptitude test and other standardized tests or percentage of graduates who went to college they used exclusively input variables , including money spent on students , property value per student , percentage of revenue from property tax and cost per student the president of the nassau county school board association , joseph barry , said there was nothing new about the findings on the inequitable distribution of wealth but the researchers make an unfair leap to suggest that because a district is poor , it is providing a poor education , he said one factor does not necessarily lead to another dr mathews and dr weinstein disagreed three types of districts based on their findings , drs mathews and weinstein divided the districts into three categories that they called the arrivers , publicly supported private school equivalents that spend more than 13 , 000 a year per student the strivers , pursuers of the suburban american dream , and the survivors , those working just to survive the arrivers are east williston , great neck , lawrence , locust valley , jericho , manhasset , north shore , oyster bayeast norwich , port washington and roslyn those districts had an average of more than 1 million of property value per student and 9 of the 10 are small , averaging 2 , 200 students , and predominantly white the bulk of the districts are strivers they spend 10 , 000 to 12 , 000 a student and pay higher tax rates than the arrivers , dr mathews said among the survivors , nine districts spend less than 10 , 000 a year to educate each student compared with the arrivers , the strivers have onethird of the property value for each student and tax themselves far above the county average , but can generate just minimum amounts of school taxes the highest tax rates are in hempstead and freeport the disparity in a relatively homogeneous community like nassau county is mind boggling , dr mathews said our study raised serious questions about the status quo it s time to seriously study and plan for school consolidation and the reform of public school financing consolidation or realignment is necessary in some of the school districts , while the dismantling of some ineffective school districts may be a more viable option it s clear that changes must be made reluctance over consolidation
call it the charlie brown complex every autumn , with infinitely resilient faith in the ultimate goodness of the human spirit , charlie brown throws his all into the kickoff , convinced that this time his sadistic playmate , lucy van pelt , will not snatch the football away at the last minute suckered again , charlie brown and every year , in late january , an entire nation seemingly gripped by selfdelusion tunes in to the super bowl hoping to see a contest worthy of the name unlike charlie brown , these viewers have actually been rewarded with a few decent games and one excellent one , two years ago in super bowl xxv , when the new york giants methodically overtook the buffalo bills but managed to hang on only because of a missed buffalo field goal attempt so it seems reasonable to hope that another genuine thriller will occur along about super bowl l , in 2016 but in a season that has not seen a game both competitive and well played since the sensational opening round of the playoffs , there seems even less hope than usual for an artistic triumph this evening \( 6 pm on nbc , with a pregame show at 3 30 pm \) none of this is likely to have the slightest effect on the size of the television audience , which numbered about 120 million people last year , according to nielsen estimates many explanations have been offered over the decades for the inferior quality of super bowl play overcautious coaches , distracted teams , relatively uninvolved crowds at neutral sites but no one knows why the fans keep teeming back to the tube in millions sufficient to make advertisers drool or more to the point , to make advertisers unleash their millions actually , the fans are the least of it through the years the national football league , the three major networks and freespending sponsors have cannily reached out to the captive audience families and friends of fans and to curious outsiders with glitzy ancillary events , gradually turning a mere championship contest into a gaudy spectacle far transcending sport even in countries where a football is round and dalmatiancolored , many will tune in today , if only for the pregame and halftime festivities featuring garth brooks , michael jackson and magic johnson to most of those viewers abroad , as to many americans , the final score and whatever athletic prowess may go into it will matter little more than mr brooks s or mr jackson s performance will matter to the hardcore footballer this cozy symbiosis of sport and commerce did not evolve accidentally the super bowl is the only championship of a major american professional sport that was conceived for television from the ground up thus the attempt to insure studiolike conditions by confining the games to warmweather or indoor sites the networks share the game on a rotating basis , with an extra week s layoff built in for media hype other sports , meanwhile , have tripped over themselves rushing to accommodate the needs of networks in the scramble for ever bigger bucks , showing similarly blatant disregard for the wishes of fans \( in such dubious bargains , the once proud national pastime of baseball has invited no end of indignities as often as not , playoff and world series games are hopelessly marred by the latenight chill of october and end long after most children and sensible adults have retired , at least on the east coast \) despite these efforts , the super bowl retains an inherent advantage as an occasion for a national holiday of televised sport a oneshot event , it yields a definitive result on a day fixed well in advance and to boot , it has that lovely gap at half time , which can be stuffed with entertainment , commercials and various ungainly blends of the two , and expanded for the purpose without damaging anything except , perhaps , the momentum and flow of the game but who worries about such details \? only the longsuffering fans , who are the real captive audience of the super bowl in fact , the game never belonged to them at the beginning , it seemed a grotesquely misnamed farce , an artificial mating of two grossly disparate species on a par with television trash sports like battle of the network stars no oldline national conference fan , certainly none who had followed vince lombardi and the green bay packers through the 1960 s , could imagine for a moment that either the kansas city chiefs or the oakland raiders of the american conference belonged on the same field with the pack but in super bowl iii , joe namath and the upstart new york jets turned the eternal verities upside down by trouncing the powerful baltimore colts at a stroke , the super bowl became larger than life , and a veritable cash machine for the networks monday night football was invented then the bud bowl with each passing year , the game became more and more lost in the bombast but no matter football fans will of course come back for their pittance year after disappointing year , and not just for lack of anything better to watch in the dreariest season of the sporting calendar for them , as for those drawn by mr brooks and mr jackson , the super bowl is a spectacle , but more a wake than a celebration though the season now departed was not very scintillating during its lifetime , especially for new york fans , and succumbed to rigor mortis before its appointed hour , respects must be paid and despite the desultoriness of the affair as a whole , there are sure to be magnificent individual efforts , eulogies to the deceased season s genuine charms a run to daylight by emmitt smith , a touchdown bomb by jim kelly then again , who knows \? just maybe dallas and buffalo will muster a great game , a second exception that will begin to alter the rule and , oh , yes , charlie brown give it another shot lucy wo n't pull the ball away this time , she promises charlie brown cartoon

phoenix , june 8 before a ball could be dribbled , a point scored , a game completed or a championship won , the chicago bulls and the phoenix suns were sadly forced to put their battle for the national basketball association title into a different place today because of the death of drazen petrovic of the nets with game 1 of the nba championship series on wednesday night , there was the usual talk of maneuvers and matchups , but mortality seemed foremost on everyone s mind i have a sick feeling , said the suns' danny ainge , who played in portland with petrovic for half a season i loved the guy we were competing for the same minutes , but i never in my life saw anybody who wanted to succeed more than drazen when i heard the news , i just could n't believe it i'm sitting with my business partners worried about numbers and bank accounts , and none of it mattered anymore this will be charles barkley s first nba finals , but he was feeling very depressed after hearing of petrovic s death while attending a private party at teammate dan majerle s local restuarant right now , it feels like a death in the family , said barkley i did n't know him all that well , but i talked to him a few times he showed what a great player he was , especially in the olympics , the way he played against us michael jordan continued his boycott of the news media , but a teammate who was with jordan when he learned of petrovic s death monday night said the news was jolting according to darrell walker , he , jordan and trent tucker were relaxing in jordan s suite monday night when news of petrovic s death flashed on the television walker said jordan put his hands over his face and shook his head the news kind of messed michael up , said walker i remember trent saying , 'the dragon s dead \? i do n't believe it' we started talking about a lot of things , like reggie lewis i said , 'you feel like you 're on top of the world and like you 're in the best shape of your life then you run down the floor and fall on your face' michael started saying over and over , 'hey , you 've got to live your life , you 've got to live your life' the news about petrovic made jordan s playoff travails appear almost trivial , though he refused requests by a league official to even make a statement regarding petrovic jordan did indicate to the league , however , that he might resume talking later in the series the finals have been billed as jordan versus barkley the former shooting for a threepeat the latter aiming for his first nba title but the players considered the two best in the game are rated as surething performances , if not a neutralizing factor barkley , like the knicks , is focusing on scottie pippen as the key player the suns must control richard dumas is going to have to play well for us , said barkley of the 6foot7inch rookie forward whose game has declined considerably since the start of the playoffs he s the only guy we have who can match up with scottie the bulls , meanwhile , see the suns' point guard , kevin johnson , as the player who could potentially spell big trouble for them guys like johnson and tim hardaway have that penetration that is almost unstoppable , said the bulls' coach , phil jackson they cross over , right to left , and create shots for themselves and everyone else and if you allow phoenix to start opening up your defense , that s when they can kill you with their 3point shooters we 'll have to find a way to keep people in front of him of their three playoff series , only once have the bulls faced a point guard with the creative skills of johnson that was in the second round , and they were able to contain cleveland s mark price as well as possible , which helped them sweep the cavaliers johnson confined his filmwatching to the bulls' sixgame elimination of the knicks , and was hardly daunted by the confusion the bulls wreaked and the 110 turnovers the knicks committed i think we 're going to look forward to that , said johnson , typically sure of himself it s something we think we can fare well against rebounds phil jackson was upset that the america west arena floor was unavailable for workouts tuesday , because of the weeklong japan show both teams were forced to use the suns' practice court , but the bulls' coach felt it deprived his players of a chance to familiarize themselves with surroundings they experienced only once this season jackson said the bulls would try to avoid doubleteaming charles barkley , hoping horace grant can force barkley into taking as many jump shots as possible the last rookie coach to make the finals before suns coach paul westphal was mike dunleavy with the los angeles lakers two years ago the bulls won that series , their first , in five games
a 14yearold girl was sexually assaulted by a teenager in a crowded swimming pool in the bronx yesterday , after she was surrounded by several young men who pulled off her bathing suit , the police said a 17yearold boy was arrested a short time later and charged with assaulting the girl by fondling her and inserting his finger in her vagina , said a police spokesman , sgt john mccluskey the incident occurred in crotona pool , a large swimming pool run by the city s department of parks and recreation in crotona park near east 173d street in the tremont section a holiday crowd of more than 3 , 000 had come to seek relief from the 90degree heat , including the girl and her mother horseplay turns ugly at least 1 , 200 people were frolicking in the pool around 3 pm when a group of young men started splashing and dunking some teenage girls in the water , witnesses said it was not clear , the police said , just when the lifeguards became aware of the incident a bunch of boys were splashing the girls and tearing their tops off , said frances rodriguez , 31 , who was at poolside when what had appeared to be playful fun suddenly turned into something worse one of the girls was screaming and crying for someone to help her the girl s mother jumped into the pool and brought her daughter to the edge , trying to calm her down , said ms rodriguez , who counted about 10 young men who had surrounded the girls her top was off and she was upset , ms rodriguez said of the girl the victim , who was not identified by the authorities , was taken to bronx lebanon hospital for observation and treatment aside from the psychological trauma she suffered in the incident , she was not believed to have suffered serious physical injury , the police said sociologists and psychologists have reported that sexual attacks among adolescents appear to be on the upswing , reflecting increasingly brazen attitudes about violence and sex among young people last week , seven teenagers were arrested in montclair , nj , and accused of a series of sexual attacks on two 14yearold girls while such incidents are not common , there has been an increase in the number of attacks involving groups of young men as opposed to individuals the police said that the girl told them about four or five of the young men had ripped off both the top and the bottom of her twopiece suit , but that only one of them had physically assaulted her the girl and her mother reported the incident to a park official at the pool , who called the police after officers from the 42d precinct arrived , they walked the victim around the pool , and she pointed out the 17yearold boy , philip munoz , of belmont avenue in the bronx , who was still in the water officer ruben roman called the suspect from the pool and arrested him the girl was not able to identify any others immediately , but sergeant mccluskey said that four or five others had been involved in the incident and that investigators were pursuing other leads it was not immediately clear whether the lifeguards were aware of what was happening when the incident began the arresting officer said he had heard that some people knew what was happening but were afraid because of the size of the group , sergeant mccluskey said but we 're not sure if the lifeguards were aware of what was happening seven lifeguards on duty edward norris , assistant commissioner for citywide services of the new york city parks department , said that seven lifeguards and a lieutenant were on duty at the time of the incident mr norris said it was possible that one or more of the lifeguards had sensed that something was wrong before the girl started screaming , but he added that in a large crowd it can be difficult to distinguish play from something worse when the pool is that crowded , and people are playing and horsing around , it s difficult to pick things up , mr norris said another witness to the incident , john wilson , 27 , said , everybody was just having fun , and they must have taken it out of proportion he and other witnesses said that boys and girls often roughhouse in the pool , but none could remember a recent assault
my life as a fan by wilfrid sheed 221 pp new york simon schuster 20 confronted with a title like my life as a fan , with the team in question the brooklyn dodgers , even the casual fan may think have n't i read this book before \? more than once \? following one of three teams with storied and exhaustively chronicled disasters in their histories , the boston red sox , the chicago cubs and the brooklyn dodgers , has become the dominant metaphor , apparently , for being a fan you live and die with these guys they always raise your hopes , you are always disappointed it seems in baseball mythology that those are the only teams that are allowed to have suffered or rather , theirs are the only fans whose suffering has achieved the requisite nobility but if the criterion for entrance into this club is the spectacular , moonstruck , wrenching loss , then why do n't the poor fans of the 1969 baltimore orioles qualify \? if the criterion is an endless , desolate stretch without a world series championship , then where are all the sympathizers for fans of the chicago white sox , who last won in 1917 \? such questions puzzle wilfrid sheed , but only in passing , like much else in this odd , breezy memoir mr sheed , a novelist and essayist , relates that as a normal healthy little egghead dividing his childhood between england and the united states , he discovered to his horror that he had become a sports fanatic , and as such , different in a new kind of way , a deviant , but a harmless one you have to be a little weird to know all that stuff , and weird can never be the best thing to be , but you 're all right , you 've turned your powers to benign , goodguy purposes aware of the possible banality of a memoir based on a childhood infatuation with sports , he nonetheless cannot resist thinking that all that material has to be worth something for one thing , it may , he asserts , be a way of getting at childhood , at that quirkiness and force of emotion that seem to flatten out as you grow older reviewing such a case as his own an english boy discovers american baseball might be an escape from the confinement of his habitual ways of seeing it might be one of the last times you would ever find yourself looking at a picture in which every single detail was new to you and , in fact , the book at its best illuminates how a child s mind works and learns when he is becoming a fan the solace and the pain of giving yourself over emotionally to that roll of the dice great favorite teams of the past , mr sheed writes , can form handy daydream centers that you can move into for a few minutes as you might move into shade on a hot day , for rest and reflection , and the pain , when it comes , is like nothing experienced before none of the normal kids i knew seemed to have ever come within light miles of the rich , billowing sorrow i felt when the cardinals passed the dodgers in 1942 an adult causing such pain to a child would be put away somewhere and there is a nice sense throughout of what boys respond to the ways in which images of athletes cement a youngster s fascination , for example , or the difference between the fierce , focused concentration of watching your team alone versus watching with friends , during which you try to enjoy the game in a different way a laidback , jocular , south seas sort of way along the way , insights about the game and its personalities are deployed with mr sheed s characteristic wit leo durocher must have decided early in life that if he could n't play their game as well as they did , he would make them play his , and the name of his game was uproar taking away his manic energy was like removing the battery from a complicated toy you could hardly even guess what it was for the author says of the early st louis cardinals the saga of the gashouse gang reminds one , in sober retrospect , of one of those irish uprisings that lasts five minutes and gives birth to a hundred songs in books like my life as a fan , we realize , comparisons between sport and the arts are absolutely inevitable sometimes they succeed beautifully the ritualized chaos of batting practice demands , mr sheed writes , a painter with the peripheral vision of brueghel to do justice to all these craftsmen working away simultaneously at their own specialties sometimes they do not above all the various titans that summer , one section begins , reigned the gods , jupiter and apollo , the yin and the yang , the classical dimaggio and the romantic williams as he must when traversing such welltrampled territory , mr sheed at times reinvigorates what has been described before \( ernie banks hit one so hard down the left line that i thought it was coming into the stands to get me \) he even manages something new on willie mays s storied catch in the 1954 world series the best image we will ever have of what baseball might be like if they took away the fences altogether but sometimes the territory just looks trampled we are told that joe dimaggio s 56game hitting streak transcended baseball , belonging to the world that ted williams s poetry resided in his hitting that the dodgers would always find a new way to break your heart that rooting for the yankees was like rooting for general motors that the mets of 1969 were touched by god that ebbets field was the real civic center of brooklyn and walter o'malley stripped the borough of its identifying symbol , its flag and its rallying point when he shipped da dodgers off to los angeles where american myths go to die well , yes , but who , reading this book , would not have heard those assertions before \?

american epiphanies , walt whitman and jack kerouac went beyond selfconcoction to achieve an originality that made it all look easy hit the road , get to the core , bang us in the heart with words that access the routine beauty and pain of daily life their work remains so readable and so indelibly american that it s no wonder that fresh attempts at wandering the nation and mapping its presumptive soul go forward with the inevitability of book advances lately , a formula seems to be overtaking much of the wandering it often features a narrator using the internal combustion engine as muse , with highway subbing for plot line , and dialogue bites from grizzled , terse denizens as american chorus the exercise seems preoccupied with climacteric more than climax for it often involves a restless , midsomething male deciding he must go off alone in america driving his favorite strippeddown or optionedup vehicle generically , a 19oughtsomething fourcylinder testosterone will do , with a pint of anomie stashed in the glove compartment and searching for at least that minimum of surprise and originality to fulfill a book contract , with maybe a fenderdent of transcendence thrown into the bargain the genre is no replacement for the lost american novel , at least not yet but a reader does begin itching for a clearer line between uncanny reportage and notsocreative fiction , considering how some of the latest examples pack in long coils of conversation in folksy contracted dialects that would seem too complex to be totally retrieved from the memory of a truly guileless wanderer contrarily , some of the better writing includes perfectly realized fragments of lives so burnished and broken that flannery o'connor s peacocks might be set to preening with envy then again , there is andrei codrescu , a naturalized american and the most american writer of all in the current offerings of motorized searchers mr codrescu , a poet who is best known as an essayist on national public radio , takes this drivetime script and turns it inside out into a fine trick bag of wit , discovery and selfdeprecation in a book badly titled road scholar coast to coast late in the century from the outset , he is smart enough to anticipate the main pothole in driving a 1968 red cadillac and retracing his own racy immigrant roots \( he was born in romania and came to the united states in the 1960 s \) through the locales of hippiedom i expected to find nothing in those places , he concedes , partly because there would be little time to discover anything genuine , and partly because i never found anything of interest deliberately the best discoveries of my life have been by accident fortunately , he changed his mind upon being advanced a ridiculously small amount of money that was , however , more than my poetry had earned me in a lifetime of practicing its dangerous pinturns mr codrescu takes off with a television documentary crew and a photographer , david graham , who complements the author well in glimpsing the random nonsense and unreliable reality of things in general it is a measure of mr codrescu s talent that such an orchestrated mission manages to produce an unpretentious , wry journey in the art of essay writing , from light to sparsely serious once at the wheel of america s banal instrument of carnage , the writer buys fuzzy dice and a drink holder and begins driving from his new orleans home to the lower east side digs of allen ginsberg there they lightly agree to plot for the reburial of the poet ted berrigan s remains in the st mark s church grave of peter stuyvesant , documented in passing from mr codrescu s interesting store of american antihistory as a founding antisemite thus does he putter in a kind of countertravelogue about the land , all the way to san francisco , via the kingdom of if , las vegas , with rarely a dull page in this simple book it is mainly about the fun of writing and reading and meandering , rather than selfconscious synthesizing better for the reader to have mr codrescu philosophically accepting a fax about the next city s lodgings from a cemetery attendant in camden , nj , who intrudes as the writer tries to have a special thought at the grave of whitman , sexually manifold and optimistic , the spokesman of liberty in all its guises non sequitur , no harm we 're soon visiting the burnedover patch region of surviving zealotries in a narrow swath of rural western new york first , the hutterians , the christian communist and pacifist refugees who fled hitler to live in amishlike aloofness in a bruderhof , or place of brotherhood then the descendants of the oneida perfectionists , who lived in a community conceived in free love , where the poet pines for the lost spirit of continual flirtation as in a medieval court of love mr codrescu is the sort of writer who feels obliged to satirize and interplay with reality and not just catalogue impressions he can redeem flagging curiosity in a single sentence , as when , returning to detroit haunts he loved as a student , he finds he must wax more mad maxish than whitmanesque i see that when a city becomes extinct , its last inhabitants go crazy
i was going to say that the latest car to come trotting my way was a new ford mustang , but then i realized that that was n't right aside from being a cheap play on words , the car actually came galloping with a great amount of thunder but that does n't quite work either no , this thing came snarling unfortunately , snarling is out , too i have owned both horses and fords , and none of them snarled slithered , that s what right galloped and slithered and snarled it was , after all , a cobra for 1993 , ford has come up with another in its venerable line of mustang cobras , a tradition that dates to 1965 when an exracer named carroll shelby signed on with the company and brought the name with him the original cobra was a 1962 hot rod that shelby created by dropping a 221cubicinch ford v8 into a little british body from a c bristol later , there was the 289 roadster , followed by the slingshot 427 , both wearing the asp s badge and when shelby joined his friend , lee iacocca , at ford , the engine compartment of what was then the newly foaled mustang seemed to be a perfect pit for further snakiness over the years , the name degenerated into an appearance package rather than anything substantial , and the last one made its debut in 1984 two years ago , however , ford formed a special vehicle team whose purpose was to bring to market highperformance versions of regular production vehicles the 18 , 555 cobra is the first of those , and it succeeds admirably as in the original shelby mustangs , the big difference is under the hood , and there are few markings to give a clue to the uninitiated aerodynamic extensions replace the standard rocker panels under the doors , and the grille opening is slightly different in addition , a spoiler spans the rear hatch , and there are what ford s documentation calls discreet identification badges , which means a small chrome snake on each side and the cobra name in a tiny label on the rear there is nothing discreet about the sound from shiny exhaust tips , though the roar from the 5liter v8 is glorious if , like a lot of us , you love the welltoned pulse of power with your foot on the accelerator , too , there is the sensation that the engine is hooked directly to your synapses the moment i got behind the wheel , it occurred to me that this car revved like flathead fords of old , like a car unencumbered by pollution controls and powerrobbing accessories it felt like it could breathe the standard v8 puts out 205 horsepower , and the engineers have boosted that to 235 by opening up the mustang s lungs the modifications include larger intake and exhaust ports , bigger valves , a more capable fuel pump , exhaust headers , different cylinder heads and a new intake manifold in addition , there is a new cam and rocker arms with rollers on their tips to reduce friction , a recalibrated computer and bigger fuel injectors the manifold , huge , shiny and topped with another chrome snake , is the only one of those things that you notice when you lift the heavy hood and prop it up with a steel rod but you realize , too , that the lack of such frills as counterbalancing hood struts is part of this package the cobra is meant to go fast , plain and simple to that end , there is a new clutch assembly to handle the extra torque , and the drive shaft has been beefed up the car comes with a fivespeed manual transmission , and the gears \( just so you know more than you want to know \) have been coated with phosphate and ride on better bearings to improve durability vented disk brakes have been added at the rear , and the large wheels are one way to tell the car is special they are aluminum with seven spokes and they measure 17 inches in diameter the lowprofile tires also are unique to the cobra and they carry a z speed rating , which means they can handle anything that is thrown at them depending on your derringdo and the number of points on your license , that anything might be zeroto60 acceleration in 56 seconds and a top speed of 137 miles an hour fast oddly enough , the cobra s instrumentation matches its performance , and it does n't take the usual optimistic route that makes you think you have a faster car than you do the speedometer goes to 140 mph , close to the mustang s capability , and it is accompanied by a tachometer whose revs go into the red at 5 , 800 rpm other gauges serve for temperature , oil pressure , volts and fuel , and the 154gallon tank empties at the rate of 17 miles per gallon , city , and 24 , highway not at all bad for a snake of this sort what might be considered less than appealing is the mustang s body , but that depends on the beholder there is no question that the test car was beautiful , painted metallic teal and carrying a full complement of blackout trim but the new horses pull the same basic carriage that ford has been peddling for 14 years and one that wo n't be replaced until the next series of mustang is introduced as a '94 model in december the familiar body is a bit chunky , and the suspension might be said to be dated , although the cobra s underpinnings have benefited from some tweaking here and there on the road , the car is slightly stiff but not overly so in the manner of other detroit sportsters inside , too , there is more room than you find in competitive hatchback coupes the back seat actually is usable , for example , and it offers considerably more space than chevrolet s camaro in fact , for those of us who have liked the design for all these years , the mustang cobra is well , ducky photos a spoiler and emblems behind the large front wheels mark the return of the mustang cobra the cobra has a plain , but comfortable , mustang interior the steering wheel houses an air bag \( photographs by

white plains , dec 10 a westchester nanny admitted in court today that she had fatally injured the 10monthold boy in her care by hurling him violently to his bedroom floor after he tugged at her hair after insisting for months that she had played no role in kieran dunne s death on march 3 , ann franklin told a starkly different story this morning about how the baby had fractured his skull a week earlier her eyes red with tears , her voice a whisper , ms franklin made her first public admission of guilt in a crowded courtroom that included her parents , somber and drawn , who sat an aisle away from kieran s father and mother , who occasionally sobbed audibly the baby s mother , peggy leahy dunne , is more than seven months pregnant with her second child 'annoyed and angry' ms franklin s comments came as part of a plea bargain , accepted this morning by westchester county judge j emmett murphy , in which she agreed to plead guilty to firstdegree manslaughter , a lesser charge than that of seconddegree murder she had faced under the agreement , the 26yearold nanny from rye , who faced 15 years to life in prison if convicted of murder , would be eligible for release after serving at least 8 1 3 years , but not more than 25 years , in prison , prosecutors said she remains free on bail until jan 6 , when she must surrender to authorities her formal sentencing will be feb 17 standing unsteadily between her lawyer and a private investigator hired to assist her case , ms franklin told what happened about 5 pm on feb 25 how kieran had pulled at her long , red hair as she placed him into his crib after changing his diaper i got annoyed and angry , she said evenly i shook him away from me and i swung him and threw him down hard asked later by maryellen martirano , chief of the westchester district attorney s child abuse bureau , how far across the room she had tossed the baby , ms franklin first said , it was far , before agreeing to the prosecutor s characterization that it was about six to seven feet asked what part of the baby s body struck the floor first , ms franklin , clutching a crumpled tissue in her folded hands , said quietly , his head , i believe ms franklin said that moments before she changed the baby in his secondfloor bedroom at the dunne home , she had been smoking marijuana in the firstfloor laundry room , although she did not link her reaction to the influence of the drug ms martirano told reporters after the hearing that no evidence of the drug was found at the scene and that she was skeptical ms franklin had been using marijuana at the time case stirred anxieties with her admission , ms franklin brought to a painful close a case that had fanned anxieties among working parents who leave their children in the care of nannies they often know little about the case drew immediate comparisons with that of a swiss au pair , olivia riner , who was charged and eventually acquitted last year of burning a baby to death in the community of thornwood , just 10 miles away from the dunnes' rye home after the 20minute hearing in westchester county court here , ms franklin s father , john , and her boyfriend , martin curran , said they still did not believe she had committed the crime she had described instead , mr curran said he thought judge murphy had stacked the deck against his girlfriend by ruling on dec 1 that prosecutors , at a trial to have begun next month , could present a set of photographs of kieran that indicated possible prior abuse ms franklin s lawyer , michael p romano , told reporters that his client had come forward today so that she could bring the matter to a merciful conclusion he declined to say when she had made up her mind , although prosecutors said mr romano first approached them with an offer , made at ms franklin s behest , on dec 6 it was ann s intent that the process of healing for the dunne family , her family and herself now begin , mr romano said she knew a trial would be long and painful while mr romano said ms franklin extended her deepest regret and sincere remorse for the dunnes' loss , mrs dunne , a project manager for the business planning department of the new york times , and her husband , david , would hear none of it kieran is an angel in heaven , mr dunne , an associate director at bear stearns , told reporters ann , your hell is starting today hired through an ad the dunnes had hired ms franklin in july 1992 after placing an ad in the irish echo , a newspaper that has become the central clearinghouse for babysitter jobs in the new york area the dunnes and the franklins shared a local connection , living a mile apart in prosperous rye and attending the same roman catholic church ms franklin , who worked for the dunnes five days a week , seemed to care for kieran as if he were her own , feeding him cheerios and mashed carrots and wheeling him proudly along purchase street , rye s main thoroughfare then on feb 25 , the police were called to the house , where they found kieran , limp and unconscious , and took him to united hospital medical center in port chester inconsistencies in ms franklin s account of that afternoon quickly surfaced according to court documents , she initially identified herself to the police not as ann , but as margaret , her younger sister s name , and she provided a date of birth three years younger than she actually is the dunnes had insisted , as an essential condition of the plea bargain , that ms franklin explain in open court what had transpired when she was alone with the baby that afternoon mr dunne told reporters , it s some semblance of relief , i guess , to hear how she killed our son photo ann franklin leaving the westchester county courthouse yesterday with michael p

test of a shield law joseph bosco s new book , blood will tell \( william morrow company \) , came out earlier this month and immediately caused a big stir in new orleans , mr bosco s home and the scene of the curious murder he writes about in detail , the book describes the beating death in 1984 of janet myers , a young housewife , and the subsequent trials of her husband and her lover , each of whom sought to place the blame on the other and ended up with a substantial prison sentence for the killing of all the people interested in the book , few had more reason to be interested than the lover , william fontanille , who was convicted of manslaughter and is serving a 21year sentence in a louisiana prison because of information hinted at in the book , mr fontanille s lawyer , nick noreia , asserts that his client deserves a new trial , and he has subpoenaed all the tapes of mr bosco s interviews with kerry myers , the husband , who was convicted of murder and is serving a life sentence that has put mr bosco , also the author of a book of poetry , an unpublished novel and a warmly received account of minor league baseball titled the boys who would be cubs , in an awkward position in fact , a judge ruled last week that mr bosco must either give up the material or present himself at the jefferson parish correctional center in gretna , la , for an indefinite time in jail an appeals court has placed a stay on the ruling until a hearing on dec 6 , but for now mr bosco s future is very much in doubt 'i think i'm just dumb' i want to sound all brave and courageous , but i think i'm just dumb , mr bosco said but i do believe very strongly in what i'm doing louisiana , like most other states , has a shield law that protects journalists from having to disclose some confidential materials in court but the law applies only to people working for news organizations , not to the authors of books so even though mr bosco repeatedly cited journalistic privilege in a court hearing in which he declined to answer any questions about his materials , the judge in the case , e v richards , held him in contempt and ordered him to turn the material over it is that ruling that mr bosco s lawyers will challenge at the dec 4 hearing , bolstered by a recent federal court of appeals decision in california that held that a book author should be afforded the same privileges as a journalist it is our belief that anything that anyone told bosco that is not published is privileged , said one of mr bosco s lawyers , sidney a cotlar a promise is a promise mr bosco said he was willing to go to jail to protect material he had promised would be confidential on a very personal level , i feel that i would be violating a promise i made that no one would ever hear these tapes but myself , he said and i feel very strongly that it s unfair that a cub reporter at the smallest newspaper in the smallest state has first amendment rights , and i do n't mr noriea , the lawyer for mr fontanille , said that he sympathized strongly with mr bosco , who interviewed him for the book , but that he believed this was a classic case of a writer s first amendment rights clashing with a defendant s right to a fair trial even if mr bosco does qualify as a reporter under the shield law , mr noriea said , he might well have to turn the tapes over i can understand that he has a job to do and that he probably would n't have got this information if he had n't assured the speaker of some confidentiality , the lawyer said but we have a situation where someone s in jail and that should be given a lot of weight good news , bad news the national book awards , which are to be announced tonight in manhattan at the plaza hotel , pale in comparison with britain s booker prize , which is presented in a televised spectacle , full of open vitriol , that guarantees winners a huge outburst of publicity if not a commensurate increase in sales but the awards are among the most prestigious in american publishing , and if large publishers grumble about them , it is usually because none of their authors have been nominated that is why the case of juliet wittman , the author of breast cancer journal a century of petals \( fulcrum \) , who was nominated and then removed as a finalist when it turned out she was ineligible , is particularly poignant it took ms wittman a long time to find a publisher for breast cancer journal , and when she finally did , it was fulcrum , a tiny press in golden , colo so , when she was told that her book was being entered by the publisher for a national book award , she flatly refused to believe it a shocked reaction they sent me a letter saying to please keep nov 17 free , said ms wittman , who is 51 and lives in boulder , colo i went downstairs to my husband and said , 'i'm really touched that they feel this way about my book and while they 're at it , i think they should enter me in the 1994 winter olympics as a figure skater' several months later , ms wittman did n't believe she had made the short list of five nominees for the nonfiction prize , either , until neil baldwin , the executive director of the national book foundation , which administers the awards , telephoned her himself i thought it was a hoax , and then i thought maybe it was n't the national book award , but some other book award , she said ms wittman s dream of fame and acclaim and huge sales ended with a thud when she was found to be ineligible for the award because , although she has lived in the united states for 34 years , she is a british citizen and although she thinks her brief flirtation with the award has certainly given her more exposure than she would have had otherwise , she said , the entire incident has been a highly discouraging reminder of how hard it is for unknown authors from small presses to get any attention at all it has been a long , cold dark road , ms wittman said it was very hard to get published and it s very frustrating to have written a book that you think should have a lot of readers when you know it wo n't linda stark , the director of marketing at fulcrum , which publishes about 30 titles a year , said that the book was in its second printing , having sold about 5 , 000 copies we have never won a national book award , she said in fact , we had never entered before ms wittman s replacement in the nominations was not a wellknown author , either he is peter svenson , who wrote battlefield farming a civil war battleground , an account of his efforts to harvest on the spot where a civil war battle took place mr svenson s manuscript was rejected a number of times before he sent it , unsolicited , to the british firm faber faber s american subsidiary , which accepted it

books for young readers , has been named publisher harpercollins announced yesterday that it had acquired the world rights , except in britain , to the next two novels by tony hillerman , the author

disabled list is n't an ideal way to get into a race but then , the cubs generally do n't have an ideal team for a contender forget the party line that they improved themselves by acquiring a collection of good players with the money they did n't use to resign greg maddux and andre dawson the cubs are counting on hefty comebacks from sammy sosa and steve buechele sosa played only 67 games because of a broken finger and a broken ankle , while buechele hit only one home run in 65 games after the cubs got him from the pirates because he had a strained abdominal muscle key additions jose guzman and greg hibbard are in the pitching rotation , randy myers is in the bullpen and candy maldonado and willie wilson are in the outfield key losses no individual player , and perhaps no pair , can make up for the loss of maddux and dawson key to season besides the newcomers' producing , pitcher mike harkey has to maintain a healthy shoulder and avoid the type of gymnastics that damaged his left knee last season florida marlins the fans can tell some of the players without a scorecard dave magadan , walt weiss , benito santiago , charlie hough , bryan harvey but they 'll still be watching an expansion team the initiation process mandates that the new guys on the block have to be bad pitching is where expansion teams usually look the worst , and perhaps that s why the marlins are keeping harvey as the reliever who can close out whatever games they 're leading in the ninth inning manager rene lachemann has spent the spring preaching his philosophy play the game hard , play the game right and it gives you a chance to win he s not likely to have as many chances to win as he would like key to season orestes destrade will delight if he duplicates the performance of cecil fielder upon a return from japan , and benito santiago could add some professionalism montreal expos inspired by the managing style of felipe alou , the expos staged the only serious threat to the pirates' monopoly they could be in position to win this time , but their infield and catching raise serious questions the left side of the infield will be manned by rookies , wil cordero at short and frank bolick and perhaps sean berry at third first base looked so dreadful that the expos signed jack clark the strength is in the hitting of larry walker and moises alou , the base stealing of marquis grissom and delino deshields and the pitching of dennis martinez and ken hill key addition rookie kent bottenfield joins the pitching rotation on a fulltime basis key losses tim wallach , ivan

through the land mines of a seasonlong chase philadelphia phillies a band of hitters that includes lenny dykstra , darren daulton , dave hollins and john kruk has other managers concerned about the phillies but the phillies' recent medical history has to temper the rush to hand them the division title so do question marks about the pitching staff , the worst in the league last season with the only earned run average at 400 or higher curt schilling \( 138 , 227 era \) was a surprising success as a starter , but newcomer danny jackson has n't had a winning record since 1988 and mitch williams has to abandon his unpredictable style of closing games key addition a jackson comeback would bolster the starting rotation key losses none key to season dykstra , a twoyear physical disaster , will set the tone for the championship run if he summons up the dykstra of 1990 pittsburgh pirates some of his colleagues are prepared to deify jim leyland if he directs the pirates to a fourth consecutive division title and he would deserve it if he got there without barry bonds , doug drabek and jose lind and with zane smith , his no 1 pitcher , beginning the season on the disabled list leyland s fate will be controlled by a trio of rookie regulars , kevin young , carlos garcia and albert martin a rookie starting pitcher , steve cooke , and a starter not far removed from rookie status , tim wakefield key addition lonnie smith has played in five world series with four teams , but he s no barry bonds key losses any team would find it virtually impossible to replace its best hitter , its best pitcher and its best infielder key to season the pitching would have to be terrific to carry what figures to be a lowscoring team st louis cardinals with the pirates no longer dominating the division , the cardinals and the phillies were most often cited by other managers and general managers this spring as the teams to watch so watch ray lankford lead the cardinals to the top in what could be a fourteam race lankford , who began last season as the leadoff hitter and subsequently moved to no 3 in the order , now is the cleanup hitter and could create a barry bondslike effect , improving on his 2932086 performance he will have help from gregg jefferies , who has changed teams for a second successive season the pitching rotation , beginning with bob tewksbury , has great potential , especially if joe magrane is over his twoyear injury siege key addition jefferies should swing a productive bat , but his glove at first base has to be good , too key loss lee smith

moscow , oct 6 at 4 pm , the usual clutch of onlookers gathered for one of moscow s most venerable rituals , the changing of the guard at lenin s mausoleum on red square but instead of smartly goosestepping off to the spassky gates as guards had done for 69 years , the two guards there today quietly walked into the mausoleum and into history post no 1 , established by order of the moscow garrison commander on jan 26 , 1924 , five days after the death of vladimir i lenin , was closed today on orders of president boris n yeltsin after the august 1991 communist putsch , there had been many calls to bury lenin s mummified remains next to those of his sister and mother in st petersburg , as he had asked in his will but evidently out of sensitivity to the many russians who continued to believe in lenin , mr yeltsin did not take any action there was no indication that the mausoleum would be closed to the public and that the body would be removed , but that seemed a likely next step the hourly changing of the guard , interrupted only during world war ii , had been one of the mandatory sights for visitors to the capital the chimes of the spassky tower would sound and an officer would lead two goosestepping guards of identical height , rifles balanced in one hand , to replace the two standing on either side of the door there , for the next hour , they would stand motionless , even when temperatures dropped far below zero mr yeltsin gave no explanation for his order , and none was needed after routing an uprising by militants whose dominant dream was restoring the communist empire founded by lenin , it seemed inappropriate to continue treating him as a demigod after the last guards left , two ordinary policemen strolled in front of the redgranite monument this should have been done long ago , one said it only created controversy and arguments gesturing toward the mausoleum , he added , as for communists , they 're like believers , and for them , he will always be a symbol in another blow to the memory of lenin , mayor yuri luzhkov of moscow announced today that the lenin museum , off red square , would be turned into a new city council building it was not known what would happen to the lenin memorabilia that the museum housed and included a rollsroyce photo orders from president boris n yeltsin to close lenin s mausoleum at red square halted the hourly changing of the guard for the first time in 69 years the guards performed the ritual on tuesday \( associated press \)
jose chombo silva , the veteran cuban saxophonist , blew the last notes of his solo passage , paused for a moment , then peered from the recording studio into the engineering room esta bien \? he asked \( was that all right \? \) behind the soundproof plate glass , boncana maiga , the malian music director , switched on a microphone and answered in mr silva s native spanish excelente ! ibrahima sylla , the senegalese producer , beckoned to the saxophonist , took hold of his arm and named a halfdozen of his records tell senor silva i 've listened to him since i was a schoolboy , mr sylla said in mandingo to mr maiga , who repeated the tribute in spanish mr silva bowed i 've always wanted to go to africa , he replied in spanish i do n't think i 'll get there , but i'm glad to know that my saxophone has made it over when mr sylla heard the mandingo translation , he cupped his hands and raised them over the elderly musician s head no explanation was given , but mr silva appeared pleased despite the adage about music being a universal language , musicians and the people who work with them usually find it necessary to communicate by standard linguistic means a single common language usually suffices but at the recording sessions of an adhoc group named africando , held last november at variety studios in manhattan , at least six languages \( not counting music \) were used along with various familiar and obscure gestures moreover , there was a stubborn preconception to overcome that the cubanstyled salsa being cooked up was a kind of music that only latin americans could make and would want to hear though a number of latinos hailing from several countries were involved in the recording project , it was the brainchild of two africans who hoped that the albums would appeal equally to latin music aficionados and to audiences in africa africando s debut album , trovador , is meeting that expectation in africa , where it was issued by mr sylla s editions syllart label , it is a best seller in north america , where it is available on the stern s music label , sales are modest when measured against american pop hits , but it is attracting the diverse audience its creators wanted and is being played on latin , jazz , college and public radio stations around the country interest in africando has prompted both syllart and sterns to plan a second volume from the same sessions , to be released before the end of the year the latin music that inspired africando has been popular in many parts of africa since at least the 1940 s , despite the fact that spanish has never been spoken by a significant number of africans mr maiga first heard cuban music over shortwave radio and on scarce imported records while growing up in mali i recognized the african rhythms and the african vocal styles in cuban music , he said during a break in the recording session even some of the melodies sounded familiar but what attracted me so strongly was the way cuban musicians had fashioned those wild rhythms and melodies into a modern sound , which was always elegant and at the same time sensual mr sylla described collecting 6 , 000 cuban albums before going into business as a record producer in the senegalese capital , dakar , and paris now one of the most successful producers of african music , he has collaborated on numerous projects with mr maiga , a flutist , arranger and composer based in abidjan , ivory coast when the two came to new york last november to make a salsa album with latin players and african singers , the first person they looked up was ronaldo armando baro , a singer with the popular orquesta broadway in new york , who is mr maiga s brotherinlaw together they called the latin musicians they regarded as the best in the city according to mr baro , all of them even those who had never heard of the african performers were excited about playing with musicians from africa the excitement was clearly mutual i have been singing 'la bamba' for audiences in senegal since i was 16 , the 30yearold senegalese singer nicholas menheim said now to record it with musicians of this stature he took a sip of rum the traditional throatlubricant of salsa singers from a teacup that one of the new york musicians had handed him , then drew a deep breath this is the greatest day of my career a few minutes later , when mr menheim had done his vocal an exuberant take on la bamba , the wellknown veracruzan folk song the crowd in the engineering room burst into applause the singer covered his face with his hands were you ever a mexican sailor \? joked jose garcia , who plays the cuban tres guitar when mr maiga rephrased the question in mr menheim s native wolof , the singer s look of puzzlement turned to a grin none of the africans spoke english only mr maiga , who studied music in cuba for nine years , could communicate in spanish , the language of most of the session s participants africans and latinos alike summoned him repeatedly to serve as translator whenever the recording engineer , dave lescoe , needed to confer with the producer , he would speak in broken spanish he had picked up working with latin musicians , and mr maiga would render them into mandingo for mr sylla mr sylla usually expressed himself with an upraised thumb or a finger drawn across his throat
the justice department and the massachusetts institute of technology are close to settling an antitrust suit on terms that would permit universities to cooperate in determining how much financial aid to offer applicants that is a sound resolution to a misguided case , brought by the bush administration , that charged mit and eight other schools with breaking antitrust laws by agreeing to limit aid to an applicant s financial need to the bush administration , the schools were engaging in a pricefixing conspiracy that deprived applicants of the opportunity to shop around for the best offer mit countered that financial aid was charity , not commerce , and that its cooperative arrangement with the other schools was designed to spread a limited amount of aid over the maximum number of needy students by cooperating , the universities avoided a bidding war that would have driven up aid to star applicants while leaving thousands of qualified students no means to attend the college of their choice mit has the better case pricefixing is odious when practiced by commercial businesses to raise profits at the consumer s expense but the money mit saved by limiting aid offers to prized applicants was plowed back into financial aid for other students none of the savings was used , for example , to raise faculty salaries or buy laboratory equipment each of the defendants other than mit settled the suit two years ago by promising to discontinue cooperation as predicted , the settlement triggered a bidding war for star students that diverted scholarship money away from other needy students the proposed settlement would allow mit and other schools to cooperate in limiting aid to financial need they would be allowed to discuss common rules to calculate financial need and the application of those rules to specific students the schools would not , however , be allowed to discuss offers each would make to mutual applicants as they had done before the government brought suit the schools would also be allowed to use independent auditors to check each other for compliance with the rules they had negotiated what s holding up an agreement is an unnecessary demand by justice that schools , in order to cooperate on financial aid , adopt needblind admissions , whereby a student s financial need would not affect the admissions decision such policies are commendable , and mit itself practices needblind admissions but many other schools cannot afford needblind policies and ought not to be barred from cooperating the settlement offers a sensible way out of an irrational policy it will give the universities the opportunity once again to help as many needy students as possible
it was , from start to finish , a trial of extraordinary acrimony , a bitter confrontation between two famous new yorkers for all the world to witness from testimony about a couple s conversations with psychotherapists , to a daughter s watching secretly as her sister made love , it exposed details , both trivial and painfully intimate , of the lives of a famous and troubled family and when it drew to a close yesterday in a manhattan courtroom after more than a month of dramatic , sometimes theatrical testimony , the woody allenmia farrow custody trial ended much as it began with angry charges and countercharges mr allen and ms farrow sat wordlessly yesterday at the oblong table they have shared in state supreme court throughout the trial , listening , once more , as their lawyers listed each other s purported flaws and foibles as parents if yesterday s closing arguments were to be believed , there was virtually nothing redeeming about either parent mr allen was incredibly cruel toward his own children in pursuing an affair with ms farrow s daughter , soonyi previn , said ms farrow s lawyer , eleanor b alter ms farrow was unrelenting in her use of her children as instruments of unmitigated hatred of their father , declared mr allen s lawyer , elkan abramowitz from nannies to psychiatrists mr allen has no concept of how to behave like a responsible , decent human being , let alone a father , ms alter told acting justice elliott wilk , who presided over the nonjury trial he violated the trust of his family he has created an irreparable breach all the members of this family are bleeding and need to heal mr abramowitz countered from the very moment the legitimate hurt and anger over soonyi hit miss farrow , he said , she understood better than anyone how to get her revenge he added that ms farrow s quest for vengeance could be summed up in a statement she purportedly made to mr allen before she charged that their 7yearold daughter , dylan , had been abused by mr allen you took my daughter i'm going to take yours the issues that preoccupied the lawyers during three hours of summations yesterday mirrored those that had been debated throughout the trial , which included the testimony of 30 witnesses they ranged from nannies and maids to lawyers and psychiatrists , and they testified about everything from mr allen s favorite color gray to the number of attics in ms farrow s country home along with the details of family life came other accusations that mr allen ignored or intimidated some of ms farrow s 11 children that when he visited , he brought toys for two of his children , dylan and 5yearold satchel , but never for his third , 15yearold moses that ms farrow favored her biological children over the adopted ones that in videotaping dylan s allegations , ms farrow had coached the girl , or worse at the movies ms alter and mr abramowitz recounted many of these subsidiary claims yesterday as evidence that the other s client was an unfit parent , but they always returned to their central arguments ms alter hammered away at mr allen s affair with miss previn , saying that the persona he effected on the screen did not jibe with the real person one of the appeals of woody allen s movies is that he is a moral neurotic who s always exonerated , she said the problem is in real life , he cannot always be exonerated mr abramowitz , meanwhile , citing the conclusion of experts from yalenew haven hospital that dylan had not been molested by mr allen , focused on the possibility that ms farrow s rage over the affair induced her to manufacture the abuse charge the silent center throughout the trial , dylan has been the silent center of the case and it was only over dylan that mr abramowitz and ms alter could find any room for agreement both acknowledged that she was the chief victim of the battle between ms farrow and mr allen , and that she would need time and care to recover in her closing argument , ms alter asked justice wilk to continue the current visitation arrangements , which allow mr allen supervised visits with satchel twice a week , but none with dylan moses has expressed no interest in seeing him mr abramowitz told the judge that mr allen wanted a custody arrangement that would allow all his children to spend half of their time with him justice wilk told both sides that he would render a decision within a month
have some bread , says emily rapp it s just out of the oven you have just settled into one of the cozy seats at etatsunis , and in her hand is a bowl containing warm , slightly crusty bread so delicious that your slice vanishes before everyone at the table has been served then she hands you a menu this is handwritten each day and comes wrapped up in one of the quirkiest , most personal wine lists in the city the little package also has a separate listing of interesting wines for tonight s menu , with the notes of an inspired taster if you show any enthusiasm for wine , ms rapp will reappear with extra information my brother was interested in your wine choices , she said one night , and would like to suggest that you try the hugel pinot noir you have time to consider the wine list at some length because ordering is so easy if your party is larger than two , you will simply want to try everything on the menu etatsunis , you will know within minutes of coming in the door , is not like other restaurants this is a highly personal sort of place it is the invention of tom rapp , an architect in a former life , and his children , jonathan and emily together they have created one of the city s pleasantest places to eat dinner despite the size of the room , which contains an open kitchen and just 32 seats , the space has a spare sort of elegance the food , on the other hand , is astonishingly exuberant , accepting no limits and recognizing no boundaries neither jonathan nor i could imagine cooking the same menu for more than two weeks , tom rapp said actually , the menu seems to evolve much more quickly than that , changing bit by bit over the course of the week in response to the market and the chefs' moods the rapps are committed to a seasonal menu , and since they do their shopping at the union square greenmarket \( jonathan rapp also makes two trips a week to the fulton fish market \) , it can change with the weather that s particularly nice this time of year , when you might find that the lightly grilled food offered one hot night has become slowly braised meat on the next , after cool rains have suddenly washed across the city these fast changes are a luxury unheard of in larger kitchens the food is also unlike that found in other restaurants the rapps have no professional training , and their food has the appealingly rustic character of the best home cooking it is clear that they love food , love to touch it and smell and cut it and shape it , and this enthusiasm is responsible for the audacity of the menu and the richness of the flavors consider one recent evening , when the menu ranged across many continents you could begin with homemade gnocchi , so light they literally seemed to float off the plate into your mouth , where they dissolved without any help from your teeth or you could opt for a rich thai chicken soup , fragrant with coconut milk and kaffir lime , galangal \( similar to ginger \) , chilies and cilantro \( a similar soup made with lobster a few nights later was not nearly so pleasant the lobster fought with a soup in which the flavors had become so intense that they were busy doing battle with one another \) the choices also included lobster tail , so delicately poached in its tomato and basil broth that the meat seemed to relax , lazily , into the soup if you were in the mood for something from a completely different part of the world , there was a dish of peppers stuffed with rice , pine nuts and raisins or if all you asked was sheer simplicity , you could start with a small heap of salad , beautifully dressed entrees were less aggressive , but equally delicious the best was slowcooked pork , so tender that it fell apart at the approach of a fork , and so sweet that even the roasted tomatoes with which it was served were no competition on the side was a rich puree of squashes grilled fillet of beef , really good meat , was served with a surprisingly subtle puree of ancho chilies and a fresh corn pudding so light and delicious i was not surprised to see that it had been elevated to an appetizer a few nights later there was a wonderful piece of salmon , its skin grilled to crackling crispness , in a sauce of grilled corn and roasted peppers on the side was one of those creamy potato gratins that make life worth living the rapps also like to make a salad that is a humorous take on a blt sandwich the b and t are in the dressing , but the l has become radicchio and arugula , and they have all been joined by generous pieces of perfectly grilled chicken this is a chicken salad , of course , but one that has nothing ordinary about it desserts , on the other hand , wear their plainness with pride these are a homage to americana an apple pie that tastes as if it has just won a blue ribbon at a county fair a chocolate souffle so rich and warm and fabulous that it will shame everybody who has become blase about souffles and a mocha flan that is not always on the menu but should be we think of this as american dinnerparty food , tom rapp said by the end of an evening in this appealing room , you do start feeling that you have been a guest at a dinner given by a particularly inspired friend you want to come back in short mad 61 the fountain has no water it is opening day at mad 61 , but the fountain , which blew out the telephone system for all of the new barneys last week , is being punished still , here it is , 11 30 am on tuesday , and people are pouring into the restaurant in barneys , strolling about the perimeter to examine the wares in the marketplace \( have you ever seen such big olives \? \) and leaning against the counter at the cafe , sipping fresh orange juice and cappuccino it is a fabulous show , all these people in all these clothes and yes , they are actually eating , digging into crisp pizzas and plates of pastas and savoring the inventive dishes that the chef john schenk \( exwest broadway \) is creating squid stuffed with couscous , braised rabbit with polenta , chanterelle salads the room is chic , the crowd is elegant , and if the service is slow , well , it s opening day , and who s in a hurry \? mad 61 , 10

the cold war between contemporary art and crafts is still on the pattern and decorative movement of the 1970 s tried to effect a truce , but negotiations faltered in the 80 s a furnitureasart vogue came and went overnight , and craft objects showed up in the work of consumerist artists like jeff koons and haim steinbach chiefly for their irony value the present trend toward multiculturalism might reconcile the two categories , and exhibitions like africa explores at the center \( now museum \) for african art a few years ago demonstrated how it could be done but crossover figures in new york city galleries are still rare all of which gives glass installations , at the american craft museum , more than usual interest the six participating artists have created largescale , sitespecific installations from glass , a medium long identified with discrete functional forms and highly specialized techniques in doing so , they obscure with varying degrees of success the line between traditional craft and the kind of politically and psychologically motivated installation art popular today while none of the work in the show is earthshakingly radical in fact , some of it feels vaguely familiar and expressively tepid it represents a step in an interesting direction , and a good one for the american craft museum to be taking at this time michael aschenbrenner s ghosts in the eyes of the ones sent away comes closest to the preoccupations of current installation work its dozens of small glass sculptures , spaced apart across a high wall , have the smoothness and opacity of sea glass but are shaped like human bones pairs melted together or bound with strips of cloth , they suggest the aftermath of carnage , with stray body parts assuming an oddly abstract beauty of their own beauty is important to mr aschenbrenner s piece , as it is to the other works in this show although he shares the bodyassubject theme of an artist like kiki smith \( who has also used glass as a sculptural medium \) , he exchanges the expressive harshness she brings to the subject for a lightness of touch , perhaps dictated by the medium at hand the same is true of william morris s cache , another work that activates space by multiplying individual objects on a low platform running across a blackwalled gallery , he has lined up side by side a long row of curved , hollow glass forms shaped like animal tusks , their surfaces powdered with pale pink , green and yellow pigments and textured to simulate ivory the image that results , translucent under overhead spots , is striking but disturbing piece by piece , it is full of gorgeous detailing collectively , it suggests both a sacrificial altar and a poacher s camp filled with animal and human remains less didactic and objectoriented pieces by bruce chao and mary shaffer feel closer in spirit to the interactive multimedia environments of the 1970 s \( both artists are in their 40 s \) mr chao s eyelet eliminates the craft associations of glass the gazebosize kiosk he has set up within the museum s streetlevel gallery is constructed entirely of discarded windows , complete with their original wooden frames and paint the enclosure , like a giant cold frame , holds a single palm tree and is redolent with the scent of the houses and garages to which the windows once belonged because the artist has frosted the panes , light can enter the enclosure , but the visitor s view to the outside is blurred the transmission of light arguably glass s most poetic function is the subject of ms shaffer s point of view in a darkened gallery , she has suspended almost invisible fiberoptic filaments so that they brush against the visitor s face , or has encased them within vertical glass tubes clustered at the center of the gallery hidden lights turn on and off at intervals , briefly illuminating the filaments and tubes ms shaffer has stated that she wanted to replicate the effect of fireflies shining at night , and she has done just that the effect is appealing , though uninvolving one experiences the pleasure and the limitation of ms shaffer s idea at about the same time this is also true of carmen spera s scopa , a room full of painted glass furniture based on a folk tradition of painting on glass \( a staple of 19thcentury america , now widespread in parts of africa \) , mr spera s piece is named for an italian card game many of the images that cover his tables derive from tarotlike playing cards and the tables are actually meant for use but the work has exactly the mixture of function and sheer whimsicality that too often defines and isolates craft as a category the same cannot be said of steve tobin s water column , physically the show s most spectacular piece as much a large sculpture as an installation , it is made up of countless thousands of clear glass tubes hanging in gradually diminishing tiers down three stories from the museum s atrium ceiling a cross between an outsized crystal chandelier and a cascade of rushing water the column crashes on the basementlevel gallery floor in a cloud of white splinters that looks as soft as cotton candy mr tobin is doing something a bit madder and grander with his medium than anyone else in glass installations , but he is not alone in challenging the artversuscraft standoff as many artists over the last few decades have demonstrated , craft can infuse work with a distinct personal content \( one thinks of faith ringgold s wonderful autobiographical quilts \) , can blur sex roles \( robert kushner s paintingsascostumes in the 70 s come to mind \) and can subtly address political issues \( as elaine reichek does in her subversive samplers and handknitted tepees \) it can also reveal materials and techniques to have a singular and serious magic of their own that is the effect of the works in this show , particularly mr morris s and mr tobin s , whose ideas could not have been embodied so effectively in any other medium glass installations is at the american craft museum , 40 west 53d street , manhattan , through july 4 photo cache , by william morris , at the american craft museum \(

westchester voters will participate in a major changing of the guard on tuesday , election day , filling the soontobevacant posts of district attorney and county clerk voters will also decide whether to replace the incumbent county executive after one of the most bitterly contested political campaigns in recent memory , voters will also select a new board of legislators as well as host of mayors , supervisors , council members , judges and other municipal officials polls will be open from 6 am to 9 pm for information about voting , the number to call is 2855700 rarely has there been so much uncertainty in so many toplevel posts the office of district attorney , occupied for 25 years by carl a vergari , a republican who is retiring , has attracted two qualified candidates who have conducted a harsh campaign , accusing each other , among other things , of accepting mobtainted campaign funds the candidates are jeanine ferris pirro , a 42yearold republican and former assistant district attorney who gave up a county court judgeship to accept the nomination , and michael g cherkasky , a democrat , who rose in the office of robert m morgenthau , the manhattan district attorney , to become one of his chief prosecutors mrs pirro , who created and ran the domestic violence and child abuse bureau under mr vergari , has sought to persuade voters that mr cherkasky , 43 , is an outsider and therefore unfamiliar with law enforcement in the county mr cherkasky was born in white plains and has lived in larchmont for seven years mrs pirro is a lifelong resident of westchester mr cherkasky , who says the law is the same in manhattan and westchester , was chief of the investigation division in mr morgenthau s office when he left , supervising 75 lawyers and 150 investigators and police officers he had a budget of 14 million , which was 2 million larger than that of the entire westchester district attorney s office the right to life party candidate is john j barry the office of county clerk , which is westchester s records keeper , is becoming vacant because its fourterm occupant , andrew j spano , the first democrat to hold the office in this century , decided after a decade of service to seek higher office he was aiming for the county s top post , that of county executive , held for 11 years by andrew p o'rourke , a republican it was not mr spano s first bid for this powerful office he made a similar effort four years ago but was persuaded to back off in favor of assemblyman richard l brodsky , who was thought by county democratic leaders to have a better chance to unseat the popular mr o'rourke mr brodksy ran and lost , by 6 percentage points , and mr spano returned to his job , modernizing and computerizing the county clerk office then , last year , the two rivals began gearing up for another challenge no debate in clerk race mr spano thought he had an agreement with mr brodsky that if the assemblyman lost in the 1989 race , then it would be mr spano s turn to be the candidate mr brodsky said no such pact existed defying mr spano and the democratic leadership , who endorsed the spano candidacy , mr brodsky forced a primary race and narrowly won meanwhile , mr spano s soontobevacant office has attracted two major candidates , the eastchester town supervisor , james p doody , a democrat , and county legislator leonard n spano , a republican who is not related to andrew spano , the outgoing incumbent the race for county clerk has consisted of each candidate s putting forward proposals for how he would enhance andrew spano s improvements the candidates have not engaged in any debates , however , largely because leonard spano has declined to do so he says he has made more than 200 personal appearances , none with mr doody the right to life party candidate is robert j walsh o'rourke vs brodsky the major race is for county executive , with mr o'rourke s saying that he continues to provide aaastyle government , a reference to the top bond rating that westchester executives have long taken pride in maintaining he says mr brodsky is unsuitable for the job and does not have the right temperament mr brodsky says mr o'rourke has become weary in his 11 years in office and , in fact , had not expected to be running this year mr o'rourke was nominated by president bush for a federal judgeship , but the senate , which must confirm nominations , did not consider it before the 1992 presidential election effectively doomed republican nominees mr brodsky has also campaigned strenuously on the ethicsingovernment issue , picking up where he left off in the 1989 campaign when he sought , largely unsuccessfully , to associate mr o'rourke with donations that concessionaires at playland , the countyrun amusement park in rye , had to pay to the republican party to win contracts during this campaign , mr brodsky has benefited from newspaper articles s about favors mr o'rourke evidently sought to provide in the form of jobs and contracts to companies employing members of his family and close friends unemployment a key issue
toronto , oct 17 on one side , perhaps outside the cage , is jim eisenreich short hair , no scruffy beard \( no beard at all \) , no protruding stomach on the other , mitch williams hairy , wild , unpredictable , nerveracking eisenreich , who sat out virtually five years early in his baseball career because of a belatedly diagnosed case of tourette s syndrome , crushed a thirdinning , threerun home run against dave stewart that propelled philadelphia to a 64 victory over toronto tonight in the second game of the world series the victory was n't complete , though , until williams induced pat borders to ground into a double play before williams reached that point , he provided a typical wild thing performance , highlighting it with a move that enabled him to catch roberto alomar trying to steal third base with two out in the eighth inning with williams registering his third save in five postseason victories , the phillies were able to head home with a 11 tie , awaiting the third game that is scheduled for tuesday night danny jackson , whose performance in the fourth game of the national league playoffs against atlanta helped turn that series around , will pitch for the home team against pat hentgen , a 19game winner , who was the loser in the third game of the american league playoffs a history against stewart in tonight s game , eisenreich , whose tourette s is controlled by medication , turned a tworun flurry against stewart into a fiverun outburst that gave the phillies a lead they held despite various attempts by the relentless blue jays to catch them the last couple years when he was with oakland , i can remember almost to the pitch that i hit a couple home runs off him , one in oakland , one in kansas city , said eisenreich , who had hit 32 home runs in 2 , 526 career atbats , or one every 79 tries , before this one he s the only guy in the league i 've ever hit two home runs off but i felt real comfortable at the plate i said in the dugout i felt i could hit one curt schilling said hit one for your daughter with the 50 lead having become 63 , the blue jays rallied in the eighth inning paul molitor doubled , roger mason threw a third strike past joe carter , who had hit a tworun home run in the fourth , and manager jim fregosi called for williams we 're all nervous when mitch comes in , eisenreich said he puts guys on , but he comes back and gets them he s not the wild thing for nothing we 're nervous obviously , but at the same time we 're confident because he got the job done with john olerud at bat , molitor stole third he then scored on olerud s fly to right with two out , the situation looked tame , but williams livened it by walking alomar with tony fernandez at bat , alomar , like molitor , took advantage of williams s big leg kick and slow delivery and stole second but then he made the fatal mistake , trying to steal third on the next pitch instead , he committed the grossest of baserunning violations he violated the agesold baseball maxim that a runner does n't make the first or third out at third base he has a green light , manager cito gaston said later , meaning alomar can run when he wants but he left no question that the play was foolish normally , the manager said , i would put a stop on it if it were anybody else but robbie normally he does n't do that normally you do n't have to bother with robbie he s what i call a lowmaintenance type of player alomar seemed to be at a loss to explain what happened i probably should n't have done that , he said he made a good move and got me out but i do n't think that was the game it was only one play but it was a pivotal play because , as he proved in the playoffs , williams is capable of doing all sorts of weird things when he s in the game i do n't think he s seen that move before , said williams , who out of the corner of his eye saw alomar break for third , then stepped off the rubber and calmly threw to third ahead of him i had n't picked anyone off in three years with that move doubleplay does it williams began the ninth inning by walking fernandez on four pitches then he went to a 31 count on sprague before throwing a called strike , then getting him to ground into a force out borders followed with a grounder to shortstop that became a gameending double play that made a loser of stewart , who continued to confound observers of his postseason performances he pitches in the postseason with a split personality , being unbeatable in the league championship series but very beatable in the world series stewart entered the game with an unwarranted aura his continued remarkable success in the american league playoffs was so fresh in everyone s minds that many viewed him as invincible but his alltime best 80 record \( with a 203 earned run average \) in pennant playoffs bore no relation to his performances in world series games , as if a personal line of demarcation had been erected between the two postseason series in six series starts with the oakland athletics , stewart had a 23 record , and now that record is 24 early trouble

rafiah , israelioccupied gaza strip , dec 22 an ak47 automatic rifle slung over his shoulder , khaled tafish sauntered down a street in the shabura refugee camp here with two armed companions dozens of young men with pistols tucked into their belts nodded in greeting one tossed a hand grenade up and down in his hand we control these streets , said mr tafish , 24 , the local leader of the fatah hawks , the military wing of yasir arafat s faction in the palestine liberation organization the israelis no longer come into this part of the camp we make the laws and punish the offenders the real world in the camps while israeli and palestinian negotiators try to work out the fine points of an agreement that will lead to an israeli withdrawal , life on the ground has already changed israeli troops have quietly ceded whole sections of the sprawling gaza refugee camps to palestinian guerrillas , who just four months ago were hunting israeli soldiers and living on the run we have an understanding with the israelis , the wiry leader said as he took a drag on a cigarette as long as we do not attack the troops , they do not come into the parts of the camp we control they do n't want us to carry our weapons , but we refuse to put them down israeli military officials said they had brokered a truce with the fatah hawks and now permit them to operate unmolested in some areas we try as little as possible to disturb them , a military official said , to avoid problems and give peace a chance there s even a bureaucracy the shabura camp , with 64 , 000 people , is a maze of concrete hovels , rutted streets and open sewers along the dusty border with egypt electrical wires droop over the narrow dirt streets palestinian flags flap from rooftops nationalist graffiti exulting al fatah covers the walls but the most surprising addition to the neighborhood , which the young fighters have nicknamed fatah land , is the oneroom office opened by the fatah hawks on shabuta street a huge banner draped across the road in front of the office reads welcome to fatah land ! home of the courageous fatah hawks ! taped to the plateglass window is a list with 50 names of young men from the fatah hawks who have been accepted by the leadership of the plo for the police force that is to maintain order when the israelis pull out the force will be made up of some 7 , 000 palestinians now in exile and as many as 8 , 000 from the occupied territories , including former fatah hawks several dozen fighters who are not thought to have been involved in killing israelis have been offered a general amnesty by israel but even those not covered by the amnesty nonchalantly roam the gaza strip , often heavily armed the palestinians put the total number of fatah hawks at 500 to 600 once panthers , now hawks the fatah hawks were founded in 1991 , but many of the guerrillas had been members of the armed group called the black panthers , which was disbanded the group recruits young men from the shantytowns and refugee camps but the leaders receive their orders from tunis , where mr arafat is based most of the weapons are bought on the black market , either from israeli drug dealers or from arms merchants who smuggle them from egypt money comes from the plo with little preparation , the fatah hawks have been catapulted from guerrillas to rulers of tiny fiefs when mr arafat and his lieutenants move into the gaza strip and the west bank town of jericho , they will build their organization on the turf carved out by these young toughs neighborhoods and even alleys in the gaza strip are often controlled by particular palestinian factions and the decision by the israelis to turn a blind eye to the activities of the fatah hawks while hunting down armed groups allied with the militant islamic movement hamas could give the plo an edge in the looming struggle for political power rough justice how the fatah hawks govern can been seen in two recent cases jihad abu samhadara , a fatah hawks leader , flipped through a pile of letters from residents petitioning him to resolve problems from land disputes to theft we meet with various parties , he said we form committees to solve problems , and we decide who is in the right and who is in the wrong it is often a frontierstyle justice the fatah hawks recently caught some thieves and called the neighborhood residents to a small square after the crowd gathered , they shot the three offenders in the feet in another case , the daughter of a neighbor of mine accused a young man of raping her , said fathi abu araf , 31 , who sat on the floor of his small concrete house but when the fatah hawks investigated , they found that the man was innocent it was the uncle who had committed the crime the fatah hawks executed him the family then killed the girl , although they told the hospital she had committed suicide palestinians accused of collaborating with the israelis are routinely executed a few days ago , a reputed collaborator was shot dead and hanged from a lamp post hobson s choice fatah hawk leaders contend that if they do not maintain order , however roughshod , there will be anarchy but many admit the system has its faults we do n't have a police force , jails or courts , said abu maqusib , an ak47 rifle cradled in his arms we try and interrogate people carefully and let a committee decide the sentences we do the best we can when we get a state , things will be more systematic but the de facto truce with the israelis is shaky when one leader , ahmed abu rish , was killed by an israeli undercover unit three weeks ago , the fatah hawks resumed the offensive in the riots that followed , 60 palestinians were shot and wounded by israeli troops but relations have since been smoothed over despite the israeliplo agreement , the fighters say they will not protect israeli settlers who remain in the territories , even if the palestinians drafted into the police are ordered to do so and they say they will not interfere with armed attacks by the militant hamas movement if the israelis think we will turn on our brother palestinians , they are wrong , said mr maqusib the groups that oppose the peace agreement have the same goals we have , they just use different methods none of us will give up until the jews have left and we have our state we are still committed to the struggle photo members of the fatah hawks escorting two men caught stealing from a house in the gaza strip into the central square of a refugee camp they shot one in the legs and beat the other before setting them free \( associated press \) \( pg a1 \) in the shabura refugee camp in the occupied gaza strip , a young fatah hawk patrolled with an ak47 \( rina castelnuovo for the new york times \) \( pg a10 \) map of israel shows the location of rafiah

hempstead , li , sept 30 boomer esiason knows that if the jets are going to beat the defensiveminded philadelphia eagles \( 30 \) on sunday , they will almost certainly need to pick up short yardage in critical situations sometimes , that s the most difficult yardage to overcome , the jets quarterback said today especially against a team like philadelphia , which has so much talent on defense esiason finished his sentence , lifted his head and searched the room he locked his eyes on fullback brad baxter , pointed in his direction and said with a wide smile , that s where he comes in baxter , now in his fourth full season with the jets \( they acquired him in his rookie year in 1989 after he was waived by the minnesota vikings \) , is the team s shortyardage specialist and blocking back strong and sure last sunday against new england , he ran for his first two touchdowns of the season , rugged scampers of 1 and 4 yards , in the jets' 457 destruction of the patriots my man is a bullet , said esiason he s extremely powerful , always low to the ground , and very , very surehanded since baxter became a starter with the jets in 1990 , he has run or , in most cases , bulldozed his way for 25 touchdowns emmitt smith , barry sanders and thurman thomas are the only national football league backs to have accumulated more touchdowns on the ground during that period smith , the star for the super bowl champion cowboys , has rushed for 41 touchdowns since the beginning of 1990 sanders , the focal point of the lions' runandshoot attack , has rushed for 39 touchdowns , and thomas , the allpurpose back who has helped buffalo to three super bowls , has rushed for 27 'always comes up big' it s incredible when you think about it , said dave cadigan , the 6foot4inch , 285pound lineman who usually helps pave the way for baxter in shortyardage situations brad is a big , physical guy who gets the ball and seems to go toward the goal line at 100 miles per hour and always seems to come up big for us he s a quiet guy , but he has a lot of controlled rage that he releases on the football field he deserves to get the recognition that some of the bigger names in the game are getting baxter , whose quiet demeanor on and off the field has earned him the nickname smooth , prefers to talk about the 21 jets' competition more than his contributions when i have the ball , i see it as me against them , that i'm going to have to get them before they get me , said baxter , who is a 6foot1inch , 235pound package of muscle and just because i'm the guy holding the ball , that does n't necessarily mean that i'm the guy who is going to get punished despite his role as a shortyardage specialist , baxter has already proved that he can also handle the busier function of being the team s no 1 runner that job currently belongs to blair thomas , but none too securely last season , while thomas sat out seven games because of an assortment of injuries , baxter led the jets with 698 yards rushing his biggest day of 1992 came against miami , when he rushed for a careerhigh 103 yards in a 2614 victory over the dolphins my whole career , i was always a running back , said baxter , who was picked by the vikings in the 11th round of the 1989 draft but when i came here , they needed me to play fullback if that is what is best for the new york jets , then that s what s best for me esiason s aerial displays have been the jets' offensive trademark this season in games against denver , miami and new england the philadelphia game may be a different story baxter , whose 60 rushing yards so far are not indicative of his value , was asked just how pivotal a role his shortyardage skills will play if the jets wind up in a tight , lowscoring game on sunday the opponent in the situation does not matter , said baxter , pulling his greenandwhite jersey over his head and seemingly talking through his large no 30 every game is a challenge whether it s the patriots or the eagles , those guys are still out there to stop you philly s got a great defense , baxter added as he tossed his jersey into a laundry bin maybe come sunday , i 'll see them on the goal line
madison , nj , aug 10 if this were the giants of a few years ago , it might not be a matter of concern that the defensive line and the left side of the offensive line the side with the best players were being manned by understudies in the preseason but this is a new coaching staff with a new system , and brave words cannot disguise the fact that precious learning time is being lost because of injuries and contract disputes for coach dan reeves , who used to be his own general manager at denver , there is a nagging discomfort about the defensive line and there is little he can do those are the people you go to war with , he said today in the club s first full workout since its victory over cincinnati last saturday we 'd like to have mike fox in you 've got to worry about coaching the guys you 've got here people are n't going to trade you their stars no big deal at denver , he might be trying right now to make deals fox , one of the defensive ends , has not accepted the team s contract offer eric dorsey and erik howard , the rest of the defensive line , are injured george young is the entrenched general manager , and harry hulmes his assistant i'm giving them all the input i can about who s out there , said reeves i'm not actually calling anybody he knows , though , that other teams are aware the giants are in some little difficulty like anything in life , reeves said of the problem , other clubs use it to their advantage the 12 years i was at denver , it was very difficult to find defensive linemen then there is the offensive line eric moore will miss the first four games of the regular season because he violated the league s substance abuse policy and william roberts , the left guard who was forced to leave the game on saturday because of an irregular heartbeat , will miss saturday s game against the steelers he was released from the hospital on monday but will undergo further testing before he is cleared to return , possibly in time to face the jets on aug 21 a big noshow meanwhile , the left tackle , jumbo elliott , is among the noshows at camp , having declined the giants' salary offer the absence of elliott and roberts means the running game could suffer the new offensive line coach , pete mangurian , said that it will do the team no good to dwell on the problem and get depressed about look , you can get injured and then this thing happens , too , he said the prospects are good william will be back before the regular season , and since we 'll be playing other people , it 'll all be to the good since they 'll be getting experience what can we get out of it as a positive situation \? that is a good question , a coach s question according to mangurian , clarence did n't get us in trouble last saturday he was speaking of clarence jones at left tackle i'm not going to diminish clarence by talking about jumbo , he said jeff novak is filling on for roberts and he conceded that i know it s will s job he s the left guard , novak said but for me , next saturday is like the super bowl my first start simms in peril \? which brings up another question for the coaches is phil simms at risk behind two inexperienced linemen who are protecting his blind side \? we 're going to keep people off the quarterback , said mangurian i'm not going to overreact to this thing his defensive line counterpart , earl leggett , does n't have one starter from last season available he has told their replacements keith hamilton \( left end \) , stacey dillard \( nose tackle \) and mark flythe \( right end \) to be prepared to play longer and harder than they expected none has significant experience the regulars , though , are missing a chance to learn a new defensive scheme based on attack we will play more behind the line of scrimmage than at the line , said leggett because the giants have tendered fox an offer as a socalled restricted free agent , if he does not accept it by the end of this week , he will not be eligible to join the club until the second week of the season he would miss the opener , suspended without pay

austin , tex , sept 27 senator kay bailey hutchison was indicted today on charges that she abused her position as texas state treasurer while she was preparing for her senate campaign this past spring her landslide victory made her a rising star in national republican circles the indictment , handed up by a grand jury in austin , accuses her of using state workers , computers and supplies for her personal benefit , apparently for campaignrelated purposes , and of trying to destroy computer files and other government records once an inquiry into her activity was begun two of her top aides were also charged the indictments cap an investigation begun by the democratic district attorney in austin , ronnie earle , once an aspirant for the seat mrs hutchison now holds the investigation included a state raid of the treasurer s office within days of her election in june accusations denied as she has throughout the investigation , mrs hutchison sought today to dismiss the indictments as a political stunt orchestrated by frustrated democrats in austin who were chagrined at losing a senate seat that had been in democratic hands since reconstruction the democrats are trying to nullify the victory i won by a 2to1 margin , she said at a news conference in her senate office in washington with her husband , ray , at her side this is the beginning of the 1994 campaign none of the charges have merit mrs hutchison was scheduled to appear in manhattan tonight at a fundraiser for senator alfonse m d'amato of new york , a fellow republican , but her office announced she was canceling the appearance senator bob dole , commenting at the fund raiser , called the indictment a political witch hunt from which mrs hutchinson would emerge stronger than ever 5 counts in indictment for the moment , the indictments are likely to dim mrs hutchison s luster for the republicans top republican party officials , mr dole , had trumpeted her landslide victory in texas as an augur for republican success in next fall s midterm elections the 50yearold mrs hutchison faces five counts three of official misconduct , each carrying a maximum punishment of 20 years in prison and a 10 , 000 fine , and one each of tampering with evidence and tampering with a government record , carrying a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison the indictments were couched in general terms , and mr earle did not elaborate today on the charges mrs hutchison racked up the largest statewide margin ever won by a republican candidate in texas , 67 percent to 33 percent , in beating the interim senator , bob krueger , a democrat who was appointed to the seat by gov ann w richards after lloyd bentsen resigned to become treasury secretary senator hutchison faces reelection in november 1994 for a full sixyear term and , while most texas politicians had been casting her as a virtual shooin , many said today that the field was now likely to be crowded with both republicans and democrats sensing political blood in the water the timing of her trial is not clear mrs hutchison insisted she wanted to face the charges and get them behind her as quickly as possible , but the preparation and inevitable delays of the process also make it conceivable that she would have the trial hanging over her head in the midst of her fight for reelection the senate has no rules that automatically discipline a senator who is indicted or convicted on a felony charge it takes a twothirds vote to remove a senator , and a party caucus can always strip a member of seniority or committee assignments ten sitting senators have been indicted in the chamber s history as a practical matter , the senate would be hardpressed to keep her as a member if she were convicted of a felony , and because she is in the minority her chances of political survival would be even less mrs hutchison s lawyer , michael dowd , of washington , described the indictments as baloney and described his client as one of the most selfless public officials ever to hold that office down there but the foreman of the grand jury , saadi a ferris , in an unusual public statement , said the inquiry had been conducted with independence of politics and political persuasion and defenders of mr earle , the district attorney , have insisted that accusations by republicans that he was politically motivated were dubious , since he has made a name for himself in austin for indicting or forcing the resignation of several prominent democrats while mrs hutchison has denied accusations that she abused her office , she did say last year that campaign fundraising records , which she described as a small amount of nonstate material had been found in a treasury computer she said the work had been done without her knowledge and added it was done contrary to established procedures that carefully separate my state business from nonstate business we are redoubling our efforts to make sure it never happens but the indictment handed up today indicates that mrs hutchison acted a month later to cover up other evidence of political activity within her agency it said she moved to alter , destroy and conceal a record and a thing , namely , computer archive backup tapes of the texas treasury department , with intent to impair their verity , legibility and availability as evidence in the investigation mr dowd , her lawyer , denied that accusation today kay would n't know a computer archive backup tape if it hit her in the kisser , he said some of the charges that formed the basis of today s indictments were raised during the senate campaign and , apparently , did not take with the voters two former employees at the treasury had told reporters that mrs hutchison had required them to perform numerous personal chores for her on state time , including helping her to redecorate her home in austin one treasury employee , sharon c ammann , who is the daughter of the late gov john b connally , said that mrs hutchison once slapped her when she took too much time looking up a phone number that mrs hutchison wanted mrs hutchison denied she had slapped anyone because of the wording of the indictments , it was not clear whether mrs ammann s accusations were part of the charges against mrs hutchison earlier this month , senator hutchison appeared before the grand jury but suggested later that she had , on advice of her lawyers , exercised her fifth amendment right not to give selfincriminating evidence photo senator kay bailey hutchison denied she abused her position as texas state treasurer while she was preparing for her senate campaign she spoke yesterday in washington as her husband , ray , stood near \( stephen crowley the new york times \) \( pg b11 \)
tokyo , feb 7 is the once formidable japanese economy faltering , heading down a path of disarray and weakness \? the question would have seemed little more than a silly musing a few years ago , when japan was often depicted as a godzillalike creature gobbling up markets worldwide not only were japanese manufacturers filling store shelves with newer and more competitive products , they were plowing their profits back into developing more efficient plants and better technologies suddenly , all that seems to have changed with japan s economy barely growing , consumer spending anemic , the service sector suffering its first recession and corporate profits in a nose dive , the government bureaucrats who managed japan s economic success appear to be groping for purchase on the slippery slope of eroding confidence the old remedies simply do not appear to be working , and the policymakers' acumen is being questioned some still cling to the notion that everything is following a plan that will put the japanese juggernaut back into forward gear soon , but more and more experts are saying it could be several years before the economy is robust and everyone agrees that the economy is suffering its worst downturn in decades and that japan s commercial banks , bearing the burden of tens of billions of dollars in bad loans , are in the midst of a crisis of unprecedented proportions the longawaited reduction in the bank of japan s discount rate on thursday only buttressed the sense of drift the rate was cut sharply to 25 percent from 325 percent , which matched its record low thursday s move was the sixth time in a year and a half that the central bank had cut rates trying to keep the economy from slowing further but even this drastic step left the stock market and economists unimpressed several business leaders asked when the next reduction would take place , and there were calls for new government spending programs to stimulate faster growth steps by government the nikkei stock market index fell 3140 points thursday and then rebounded 14227 points on friday to close the week at 17 , 33290 , down more than 50 percent from its high three years ago it ended down 5117 points in trading monday in the last year , the government has announced two huge public works packages to stimulate the economy and one bank bailout plan none of these measures have done much to raise confidence or rebuild momentum in fact , some people argue that the government s efforts to bolster the stock market with large purchases of shares by governmentcontrolled trust funds and pressure on other large institutions not to sell have further undermined confidence by raising the specter of another market crash if the government withdraws paul summerville , an economist here with jardine fleming securities , argued that the remarkable boom of the late 1980 s was an aberration that created unrealistic expectations and obscured some severe problems that were developing , including overcapacity , low productivity and reckless lending policies by banks he said that japan was struggling against severe odds to regain its footing and that even when the economy regained its health , growth would be much slower than the blistering pace of the past industries will also be more vulnerable to the ups and downs of the global economy farewell to the 80 s there has been a sea change in the way people look at japan and at how the japanese look at themselves because of this , mr summerville remarked it s very doubtful we 'll ever see a period like the 1980 s again at some point the economy will come out of this stronger , but not invincible this has been a major blow at the other extreme are those like karel van wolferen , a dutch journalist and author of an influential book , the enigma of japanese power \( knopf \) he retains total confidence in the skill of the bureaucracy mr van wolferen insisted in an essay last year that the recession was part of a planned reorganization that would , ultimately , make japanese industry even more competitive far from signifying the collapse of the japanese economy , he wrote , the stock market decline and the accompanying slowdown are providing an opportunity for longterm economic strengthening , through this further consolidation and for tackling a much needed overhaul of the financial system similarly , kenneth s courtis , an economist here for deutsche bank capital markets , wrote an essay late last year , japan right on course , arguing that the economy s movements and the government s remedies were conforming very much to a predictable pattern that will produce a much leaner , more efficient economy by 1994 export muscle indeed , while corporate japan s profitability is evaporating , that is far different from its products' being less competitive the best indication that japanese goods are still muscling their way into markets abroad is the country s rocketing trade surplus , which set a record in 1992 of 1326 billion , more than double the level two years earlier exports are expected to rise further this year of course , the positions of most experts fall somewhere between these two arguments unquestionably , an industrial restructuring is under way , and it is expected to force companies to reduce their bloated costs but what is important is how much even the bureaucrats themselves are acknowledging their surprise at the depth of this recession by no means is the economy out of control , as some say , said eisuke sakakibara , a senior official in the international finance bureau of the finance ministry but we are not omnipotent we do n't control everything he insisted all the same that the ministry was working on the policy mix that would get the economy moving again it will take time , he said but it will happen bureaucrats gain influence mr sakakibara s confidence is a reflection of a fact that has gone little noticed during this slump as the problems have deepened , and as more and more business leaders have called on the government to fix things , the bureaucrats have actually amassed more influence than ever over economic activity mr courtis pointed out that , by design , the government had pushed out most big speculators from the stock market , brought the brokerage houses to heel , and put together a program of tens of billions of dollars of public works spending that gives bureaucrats enormous say over who gets contracts and what regions of the country will prosper the grip of the bureaucracy on the economy is perhaps the strongest it s been in a decade , he said the japan that emerges from this difficult patch is thus likely to be leaner , set for slower growth and , once again , guided by mandarins whose decisions set the economy on its current course
i am a sucker for roadside attractions my idea of glorious slumming is to drive through stretches of country new to me and stop along the way to look at the biggest chair in the world or performances by diving pigs so there i was happily driving west through the green mountain national forest in vermont , twisting through stands of proud old trees and catching glimpses of valleys offering themselves in the distance on the radio , a highbrow disk jockey was introducing renaissance lute music then as i crossed into new york the physical and emotional terrain leveled prosaically i passed a miniature golf course and i knew i was getting close to ground zero , which in this case was lake george , the first stop of a twoday excursion into schlock , kitsch and excess that i had charted with the help of roadside america \( simon schuster \) , a book i keep on my bedside table it was a weekday just before the summer season began and while the resort was far from thronged you could see why the place could upset naturalists and purists a lovely lake that in europe might have been rimmed by pathways for walkers , sitters and sighers was surrounded by water slides , fun parks , arcades , parlors and store after store that sold things on which lake george was inscribed these included cups , belts , plates , pens , nail clippers , combs , cutlery , wind chimes and tshirts it seemed that faux southwestern pottery and stained glass tchotchkes were gaining on the more traditional cedar souvenirs several olde time photography shops offered portraits in period dress , and on the lake front olde time paddle boats offered cruises to some ersatz past , reflecting what umberto eco , the italian philosopher and novelist , describes as the hyperreality concocted from the fact and fiction of various epochs for the benefit of funseekers in america since hyperreality was essentially what i was looking for , after a hamburger at the shore front i headed straight for the movieworld wax museum , the first of two wax museums on my list it proved a disappointment the displays , dioramas showing scenes of wellknown movies , were static there was a bit of hyperreal dissonance in not exactly knowing whether the threedimensional figures you were looking at represented dorothy or judy garland , rhett or clark gable , quasimodo or lon chaney much more exciting was the house of frankenstein wax museum here for the same price , 450 , were movement and nonstop recorded screams though the scenes of horror blurred history and literature , most portrayed horrors that had in fact occurred a medieval torture chamber showed moving figures being whipped , flayed , roasted and stretched in a display about the guillotine , the viewer was invited to push the button that activated the blade farther along there was another button that set off a simulated execution of a woman bound to an electric chair i pushed the buttons and felt something like shame i wondered whether this was a universal or general response and , if so , thought it might be a good thing to have young people do to heighten empathy then i stood back to watch a young teenage couple come through they laughed as they pushed the buttons i wondered if they thought the torture and the executions were as unreal as the displays of dorothy and rhett at the other museum another display showed a kneeling woman knifing a man in the tub the man had a towel around his head , and despite the modern plumbing , the scene was obviously inspired by the killing of marat by charlotte corday , which i assume has been a wax museum perennial since shortly after thermidor but these days it was titled merely the bathroom murder , presumably not to overburden or intimidate anyone i had come to laugh and take in the folly , but i ended up queasy and troubled most of what was represented had actually happened , but except for the electric chair , the deeds were all remote and distant the message seemed to be that horror was a thing of the past where were the more contemporary examples \? why no scenes of war , slave auctions , concentration camps , famine , khmer rouge killing fields , bosnian villages \? would people pay to see such things \? would i \? from bats to caves in this frame of mind it was comforting to look at the purely fictional panoramas , like the one in which a bat turns into dracula with the aid of mirrors stepping out of the kitschy stew of cheap thrills into unsynthetic daylight , i had to admit i had been more stimulated than i usually was by museums but enough was enough i got out of town , visited friends , and the next morning set off for my second stop , secret caverns , near cobleskill to get to secret caverns you have to pass howe caverns , then drive three miles more years ago when my children were young , we went to howe caverns i remember riding down in an elevator and following a nametagged and uniformed guide into boats for the quartermile ride on an underground pool i was assured by roadside america that secret caverns would be different
philadelphia , aug 15 the baseball rose off kim batiste s bat , and suddenly none of the mets was moving joe orsulak froze in left anthony young froze on the mound dallas green , in the airconditioned exile of the clubhouse , stared at the television the baseball tumbled in for a single , and the meltdown for the mets was complete a 41 lead over the phillies had become a 54 deficit in the eighth inning the mets were left to go through the motions of a futile ninth and then move for the exits at veterans stadium not very pretty , green said not very nice 'we just do n't know how to win' that was as politic as green was going to get his words for the umpiring in the game were neither pretty nor nice he could n't even bring himself to give voice to the words that came to mind with respect to young his club had given up five runs in the ninth inning to lose a game friday night his club had nearly wasted a 51 lead saturday night before winning by 95 and today , a fourrun first inning by the mets ended up amounting to another tease , another setup for a pratfall when it was all over , the phillies had taken two of three games from the mets their lead in the national league east looked ever more insurmountable at nine games and a grand total of 145 , 048 people had come to witness the mets embarrass themselves some more we obviously have n't learned how to win baseball games , said green ah , but how adept , how inspired , how imaginative and indefatigable they are at losing games the total is at 77 , an archive of incompetence rich in absurd entertainment eric hillman , after allowing the phillies a single run through seven innings , walked lenny dykstra to start the eighth , then gave up all hope of finishing the game one out later by allowing a tworun home run to john kruk that narrowed the mets' advantage to 43 hillman took a seat in the dugout , and young took up his position on the mound that sinister karma that descends on almost all of young s appearances was about to make its presence known green ejected young got the second out of the inning , but that brought up darren daulton , the national league s secondleading run producer young s first pitch was called a ball by umpire phil cuzzi , and green exploded in a tirade that got him ejected before he had even left the dugout there was no strike zone today , green said afterward i'm not an ump knocker , and i wish our club would stop worrying so much about them but there was no consistency the phillies , of course , managed to persevere however inconsistent the umpires might have been daulton , after amusing himself with green s tantrum , got back in the box and doubled on a 32 pitch inside third suddenly , young , who lost the game friday night to stop his string of victories at one , was in danger of losing the lead , and maybe the game he quickly did wes chamberlain drove a single through the left side of the infield to score daulton with the tying run , and took second on the throw home up came batiste , who had hit a grand slam off young to win friday s affair in the ninth batiste swung as if he was intent on slugging another home run , only the baseball came off the end of the bat orsulak , in left field , saw a big swing and made no big move in precious seconds later , he determined the baseball s flight , but it was too late to get to it before the ball hit the turf chamberlain was across the plate with the goahead run the mets had no big swings of their own left jeff kent was on the bench with a ribcage injury tim bogar , who sprained his wrist sliding across the plate in his big performance saturday night , had his hand in a soft cast the mets thus were reduced to having charlie o'brien pinch hit against mitch williams with two men on in the final inning o'brien did nothing , and the mets had done nothing more than lose more ground in the nl east they are 34 1 2 games behind the phillies
it s a male , male , male , male world later this month , latenight comedy will undergo perhaps its biggest shakeup since ed mcmahon first hollered here s johnny back in 1962 on aug 30 , david letterman will make his muchdiscussed , intensely analyzed and heavily promoted move to cbs two weeks later , conan o'brien , the nation s most famous virtually unknown comic , will replace him on nbc , following jay leno in between , on sept 7 , fox will introduce a new latenight show starring chevy chase bumped from several stations , arsenio hall will try to hold his own in syndication when all the commotion is over , there will be three new latenight shows , two new latenight hosts and plenty of rattling of nielsen ratings but through it all , one thing will remain constant nobody on a latenight network talk show will be a woman the hosts , of course , are only the most visible part of the complex machine that makes latenight work they deliver the lines that whole teams of comedy writers spend all day composing here , too , behind the scenes , men dominate the tonight show , which has about 15 writers , just hired the first female writer in its 39year history the number of women who have written for late night with david letterman during the 11 years it has been on the air can be counted on one hand , give or take a few digits \( this is the case even though mr letterman s head writer for several years was his thencompanion , merrill markoe \) and out of nine writers recently hired for the chevy chase show , only one is a woman to be sure , women do occupy several highlevel production positions both mr leno s and mr hall s top producers are women but when it comes to the creative side , women just are n't a factor like roger clinton jokes , theories explaining the male hold on latenight talk shows abound some say that as long as the hosts are male , the writers will be , too others say that the type of comedy one tends to hear after 11 o'clock broad , topical and fastpaced is just not the type women tend to write still others insist that it all goes back to the socialization processes girls and boys go through in grade school latenight hosts are usually the kind who have a comment for everything , who treat the guest in a snotty way , said robert j thompson , a communications professor at syracuse university who studies television these are the personality traits that we associate with the class clown and we never think of the class clown as a woman when one leaves the latenight time slot , the sex of comedy changes abruptly in prime time , women are , if not the dominant force , then major players between them , the writerproducers diane english and linda bloodworththomason have probably developed as many successful sitcoms as any two men working in hollywood today ms english created murphy brown and love and war ms bloodworththomason was responsible for designing women , hearts afire and evening shade and by far the biggest sitcom star of the last few years has been roseanne arnold indeed , roseanne has been such a hit that it has prompted an entire subgenre of sitcoms starring female standup comics this fall , nbc will broadcast the mommies , starring two california housewives turned standup comics and abc will introduce grace under fire , starring brett butler , a comedienne men and women on the latenight circuit say its defining characteristic is a dependence on jokes in this case , a quasitechnical term that refers to quick gags designed to get a laugh within a few lines or , in the case of late night with david letterman , a bit like a highspeed fruit toss there is never any danger of tuning in late and missing the plot , because there is none sitcom humor , in contrast , relies for its chuckles more on characters and story lines the humor is situational the protagonists are not so much inherently funny as funny in relationship to one another there are n't a lot of hardjokewriting women , dawna kaufmann , the sole female writer for the chevy chase show , said tracy abbott , the tonight show s first female writer , said she applied for a job on the show when she heard mr leno was looking for a woman she has not noticed a lot of interest from other women in her work my girlfriends who are writers tend to be on sitcoms , she said i really do n't hear , 'oh , i wish i were doing what you 're doing' midge wilson , an associate professor of psychology and women s studies at de paul university , who has done research on sex differences and humor , says that it makes sense that women are writing sitcoms rather than latenight comedy bits latenight humor leans toward what she calls putdown humor , which she believes has a male bent , while sitcoms are centered in the relationships between people and thus appeal more to women putdown humor is considered the norm because it s male , she said women s humor seems to be very much about connecting there are plenty of female comics out there performing in clubs and writing their own jokes but ms wilson argues that the jokes that women write many of them selfdeprecating are not the kind that male hosts generally

tucson , ariz as a bored teenager in a conservative colorado town , christian martensen quit a minimumwage job , packed some tiedyed clothes and followed the grateful dead band around america he led a carefree , vagabond life for a couple of years , but in the winter of 1991 , his van broke down and he needed money to keep moving when a fellow deadhead offered him 400 to find someone who would sell lsd , he accepted he now stares out the window of a narrow cell at the federal correctional institution here the man he thought was a deadhead was an undercover agent mr martensen , who is now 24 , is serving a sentence of at least 10 years under the mandatory minimum prison term imposed by congress in 1986 furthermore , because of toughened parole rules , he will serve most of that time while being tough on illegal drugs remains exceedingly popular with lawmakers and the public , a growing number of experts on the criminal justice system say the policy goes too far these critics acknowledge the problems caused by the trade in illegal drugs , but contend that punishments are often too severe it is absurd , they say , to sentence someone like mr martensen , who had no previous record , to a term that is much longer than those typically imposed on rapists , for example christian martensen made a mistake and he needed a wakeup call , said his lawyer , john runfola he did n't need to have his life ruined critics of mandatory minimum sentences say that in 1992 alone , according to the united states sentencing commission , more than 3 , 000 drug offenders who were not involved in violence and had no previous record were sent to federal prisons for terms of at least five years defenders of mandatory sentencing say the public has grown indignant over the misery wrought by the illegal drug trade , a crime they say is inherently violent and if overcrowded prisons have become a problem , they offer a solution build more prisons you ca n't get convicted of a drug law unless you knew what you were doing , said paul mcnulty , a spokesman for first freedom coalition , a washington research organization founded by william p barr , the former attorney general , that promotes strict drug laws after everything this country has been through with drug trafficking , it s very hard for people to look at these supposedly sympathetic cases and say , 'gee , we feel sorry for you' objections from judges but many federal judges across the ideological spectrum have raised objections to the mandatory minimums , and at least two senior judges now refuse to hear drug cases another , judge j lawrence irving of federal district court in san diego , quit the bench in 1991 in disgust , he said , over the sentencing laws you 've got murderers who get out sooner than some kid who did some stupid thing with drugs , said judge irving , who was appointed to the bench by president ronald reagan in 1982 these sentences are draconian it s a tragedy congress imposed the mandatory sentences for drug trafficking in a national mood of shock after the emergence of crack in the 1980 s and the death of len bias , the university of maryland basketball star , from a cocaine overdose now prison officials say the tough drug laws are the chief reason for overcrowding , with the federal system now housing nearly 40 percent more than its designed capacity drug offenders now account for 60 percent of the federal prison population , up from 38 percent in 1986 'very fashionable' sentences in congress , the subject is a difficult one in a hearing two years ago , representative william j hughes , democrat of new jersey , said , mandatory sentences have become very fashionable , and i support them , and i am probably as guilty as any member in increasing them but we get into a race each year , on the floor in particular , over the severest penalty we could come up with a death penalty and somebody would think of something to try to up that under the law , the penalties for trafficking are based on weight of the drug involved the sale of 10 grams of lsd , for example , brings a 10year sentence , as does the sale of five kilograms of cocaine punishment for the sale or possession of crack is 100 times more severe than for powder cocaine variance in sentences sentences for trafficking in lsd can vary by 10 years , depending on whether the drug was delivered on paper or on a sugar cube in the case of mr martensen , the heavy blotter paper that carried the lsd increased the weight of the drug to more than 100 grams , with the drug itself accounting for only about 15 grams it meant the difference between a fiveyear mandatory sentence and at least 10 years representative don edwards , a california democrat who is a vocal critic of the mandatory minimums , conceded that any chance for repeal of the laws was pretty slim but he held out hope for a possible modification in the law that would reduce penalties for nonviolent , firsttime offenders an amendment to the crime bill scheduled for debate in the senate would give judges the power to use some limited discretion in cases of firsttime , nonviolent offenders harsher sentences urged
on june 1 , 1991 , a jeans manufacturer named big yank shut an oklahoma factory employing 225 workers as the plant closed , the employees filed nearly 400 workers' compensation claims for injuries on the job , despite having filed only 6 in the previous year the company , which had already been battered by foreign competitors with lower labor costs , saw workers' compensation premiums for its nine factories across the country rise to more than 36 million a year from 18 million it says the increase forced it to shut three more factories that had employed 800 american workers workers' compensation has been an abomination for us , said kerry mortensen , chief financial officer of the big yank corporation , based in lexington , ky it is a major american tragedy people do n't realize that the abuse of workers' comp is causing the loss of our own jobs link to plant closings big yank s complaint illustrates a problem widely reported by employers and insurance companies but little studied so far on a national scale when companies close plants as they have during this latest recession workers' compensation claims often skyrocket lawyers defending workers argue that a flurry of claims at a plant closing reflects the plight of injured and mistreated employees who chose not to file justifiable claims until they faced unemployment there are many people who are not totally dysfunctional , but they are the working hurt , said lloyd b rowe , the president of the california applicants attorney association , a group for lawyers in workers' compensation practice now their source of income has been removed , their medical insurance has been ended and they may have little or no chance of getting another job system s intent but companies argue that the workers' compensation system of private insurance , devised at the turn of the century to support workers disabled on the job , has evolved into one that helps protect workers from economic blows companies say this evolution has been helped along by insurers that have paid the claims with little question the insurers counter that in many states such claims are hard to dispute because the laws are so lenient because workers' compensation insurance is required by almost every state , some companies in troubled manufacturing industries say they are often forced to pay stiff increases in premiums on top of annual premium increases of 10 percent in many states although experts say there has been no overall study of the problem , data from various states indicate a widespread increase in the use of workers' compensation as unemployment rises and in recent interviews , riskmanagement experts , insurance executives and investigators across the nation said employees frequently file waves of workers' compensation claims when plants close in declining industries , particularly in states with liberal workers' compensation laws statebystate reports in michigan , roger fries , the executive vice president of the competitive state accident fund , a public agency that sells workers' compensation coverage to corporations , said that in many if not a majority of the closings of heavy industrial plants in the state in recent years , 50 percent or more of the workers filed claims for strains and sprains that are not easily disproved on investigation , he said , his agency found the majority of those workers were motivated not by injuries but by sudden economic hardship his agency , he said , has fought those claims edward palsho , the secretary of the new jersey manufacturers insurance company , the largest workers' compensation insurer in that state , said that it was extremely common to find large numbers of workers filing claims for very general breathing and hearing problems upon the closing of foundries and chemical plants cheryl budd , a spokeswoman for the national council on compensation insurance , a ratesetting organization for the industry , said companies in louisiana reported bursts of claims when they shut down plants during the state s economic slowdown in the 1980 s in california , steve dornbach , the manager of a special investigation unit of the transamerica insurance company in orange and san bernardino counties , said 40 percent of the claims investigated by his unit involve plant closings , often with as many as 95 percent of the workers filing claims the california department of labor found that workers' compensation claims for stressrelated disabilities rose to 15 , 668 in 1991 from 10 , 444 the previous year alan tebb , vice chairman of the california workers compensation institute , a nonprofit research organization , said the increase was driven in large part by the state s economic downturn and corporate layoffs longterm studies in texas also indicate that as unemployment rose in the 1980 s , workers' compensation claims jumped when there is a plant closing , often there is just a ton of claims , particularly stress and cumulativeinjury claims , mr tebb said employers call it fraud but others say fraud is in the eye of the beholder dwindling business perhaps there is no more striking example of the phenomenon than that of the big yank plant in wewoka , okla

washington , may 18 a homosexual congressman today proposed a compromise to allow gay men and lesbians to serve in the military and be open about their sexual orientation off duty , so long as they keep it private while on duty the congressman , representative barney frank , democrat of massachusetts , said in a telephone interview that he would prefer completely lifting the ban on homosexuals in the military , but that we do n't have votes for that in congress mr frank s plan differs from one offered by senator sam nunn , democrat of georgia , by allowing homosexuals to be open about their sexual orientation while off duty or off base senator nunn , who heads the armed services committee , said saturday that do n't ask , do n't tell could allow homosexuals to serve in the military if they 're dedicated to that purpose , as long as they keep that private life private colleague has contrasting view the other acknowledged homosexual in congress , representative gerry e studds , also a massachusetts democrat , immediately took issue with mr frank s position , accusing his colleague of prematurely raising the white flag on this issue the contrasting views on the emotionally charged issue , even among advocates of homosexual rights , reflect the debate that has emerged in the past week over how open gay men and lesbians in the military should be allowed to be about their sexual orientation mr frank is the first prominent advocate of gay rights to endorse a position that accepts less than a total commitment from the clinton administration , at least initially , to lift completely the ban on homosexuals in the armed forces i'm trying to indicate a position i think is sustainable in congress , asserted mr frank , who said in an article in the boston globe last weekend that he could support a compromise on the do n't ask , do n't tell plan senior pentagon officials and scott williams , a spokesman for senator nunn , declined to comment on mr frank s position effort to reach compromise but the lawmaker s plan clearly intrigued congressional and defense department officials who will meet early next month in an effort to reach a compromise that honors president clinton s pledge to end discrimination in the military on the basis of sexual orientation mr frank , who announced his compromise plan at a news conference , said in an interview that under his plan if someone runs in a a soldier or sailor for offduty behavior like going to a gay bar or attending a gay gathering in civilian clothes , the military s response should be , none of your business even now , some bases tolerate service members' patronage of gay bars , although such practices could lead to discharge proceedings gayrights groups found several faults with mr frank s initiative barney s proposal is a creative gambit which , while preferable to the deeply offensive policy now , perpetuates the underlying policy of discrimination , said thomas b stoddard , coordinator of the campaign for military service , a gayrights group
gary clark returns to washington with his new team today , but it will hardly be old home week during his first eight years in the national football league , clark was a fourtime pro bowl wide receiver for the redskins , a terror on deep routes but he complained too much , especially when quarterback mark rypien was passing badly , so there were few tears in washington when clark signed in march with the phoenix cardinals it s still early in the season , of course , but if there are any tears now , they may be coming from the cardinals because of clark and their other highpriced newcomers during the offseason , phoenix gave threeyear contracts to clark \( 6 million \) and quarterback steve beuerlein \( 75 million \) as unrestricted free agents and they gave their top draft pick , garrison hearst , 75 million to be their rookie savior instead of rescuing the cardinals from their traditional blahs , those three bombed out in last sunday s 2317 loss to the philadelphia eagles clark uncharacteristically dropped three passes beuerlein completed only 7 of 19 passes for 93 yards and was benched for the second half hearst carried seven times for 3 yards in fairness to hearst , he had signed only the week before and was still rusty and he can take solace in the soft numbers that emmitt smith put up in the first four games of 1990 as a dallas cowboys rookie two carries for 2 yards , six for 11 yards , 17 for 63 yards and 12 for 28 yards no name tags needed old acquaintances are renewed this afternoon across the nfl landscape dallas and buffalo relive super

session , however , figures to be reggie white and the packers playing host to white s old team , the philadelphia eagles it s a football game , the object is to win , white told the philadelphia daily news i'm sure none of those guys are saying , 'reggie was with us the last eight years , so let s take it easy on him' if randall has a chance to juke me , he 'll juke me if i have a shot at him , i 'll take it that s the nature of the game white feels enormous scrutinty after becoming the major freeagent signing in the league s first year of wide player movement i'm used to people watching me , but this is different , he said it s like they want me to fail i'm not saying everybody is like that , but some people would love to see me fail so they could ridicule me i keep hearing that i'm slowing down i 've been hearing it for three years but i do n't hear it from the guys who have to block me , and they are the ones who would know the setting of the game will be a little haunting for eagles quarterback randall cunningham two seasons ago at green bay , he was injured in the season opener and missed the remainder of the year reggie , if he gets mad , nobody can stop him , cunningham said we 've got to make sure he does n't get mad it was at an april 1 , 1991 , playersonly meeting called by white that cunningham s leadership was criticized by his eagle teammates that meeting was really ridiculous , cunningham said , looking back the players went to reggie and he called the meeting and wanted to make sure everything was cool it was everybody against randall nothing was lost between me and reggie , but we just did n't hang out as much the team was falling apart the national walsh league bill walsh may be back in college , coaching at stanford , but the offense he ran with the san francisco 49ers is bigger than ever in the national football league with such disciples as mike holmgren of the green bay packers , paul hackett of the kansas city chiefs and jim fassel of the denver broncos spreading walsh s gospel of the quick , short pass , many teams are willing to take short gains and save the bombs for the right moment even the washington redskins and their bombardier quarterback , mark rypien , seem to be less greedy , perhaps because their fastest receiver , gary clark , has moved on to phoenix in monday night s 3516 whipping of the dallas cowboys , the redskins often threw short their inside running was so good that the cowboys could never find a defensive rhythm when we thought it was a pass , said charles haley , the cowboys' passrushing defensive end , it was a run when we thought it was a run , it was a damn pass they dictated to us what they were going to do and did it a little excitement would n't hurt everything wo n't be up to date in kansas city until people there appreciate that joe montana is a football gem montana , perhaps the best quarterback ever , played only 30 minutes in the two previous seasons , the victim of a torn tendon in his right elbow \( he passes righthanded \) at his request , the san francisco 49ers traded him to the chiefs , and last sunday , in his first game for his new team , he passed for three touchdowns and looked great in a 273 rout of the tampa bay buccaneers

fight the conclusions of the stillsecret final report on the affair at stake are the reputations of some of the highest officials who served under presidents ronald reagan and george bush , including some who were not charged with crimes but whose activities in the armsforhostages scandal may be dealt with harshly in the report by the special prosecutor in the case , lawrence e walsh the report is expected to assert that officials at the highest level conspired to deceive the public it will also stand as mr walsh s coda on the tangled affair , his opportunity to define , in his own terms , the culpability of some officials in a scandal that many republicans long ago dismissed as an attempt to transform a political dispute over the nicaraguan rebels , or contras , into a farreaching criminal case legal battle is likely as a result , there is serious discussion in legal circles here suggesting that lawyers for some top reagan and bush officials may mount a last legal battle to suppress the report , a battle that would almost certainly be waged in secret because of a court order barring lawyers or their clients from discussing the matter the complaints about the report have emerged in the last two weeks , after a special threemember panel of appeals court judges , who supervise independent prosecutors , invited a number of people named in the report to visit the federal courthouse here so they could review selected portions of the report , which was filed under seal by mr walsh on aug 5 the panel is headed by judge david b sentelle of the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit the other appellate judges on the panel are john d butzner jr , a senior judge on the fourth circuit , in richmond , and joseph t sneed of the ninth circuit , in san francisco none of those asked to respond to excerpts from the report know who else has been asked to examine it none of them have been permitted to take any pages outside the courthouse , nor have they been allowed to copy any pages or even read the full text of the threepart document , which consists of one classified volume and two unclassified volumes that total from 1 , 000 pages to 2 , 000 pages one of the court s secret orders , issued on aug 5 , advised a select number of lawyers and their clients named in the report to submit any comments by oct 4 after that the court is expected to make the unclassified portions of the report public along with the comments the classified portion will be sent to the congressional intelligence committees , but will not be disclosed as part of its procedure to guard against unauthorized disclosures , the judicial panel issued an unusually broad order barring lawyers and their clients from discussing the report with outsiders or even acknowledging the report s existence the ban has infuriated some lawyers , who nevertheless would not comment publicly some people who have seen parts of the report complained that the panel s procedures bars them from making protests against what they criticized as an arbitrary process for choosing the portions they were allowed to review they accused the panel of choosing fragmentary and narrowly drawn excerpts that denied them an opportunity to reply fully to the report flurry of veiled threats the complaints have led to a flurry of veiled conversations in recent days among some of this city s most powerful lawyers about legal action to suppress the report at least until the court provides wider access to people affected by it some lawyers say they have even heard discussion of efforts to persuade the judges to permanently seal the document , on the ground that it gratuitously damages the reputations of former government officials last december , with less than a month remaining in his presidency , mr bush effectively cut off mr walsh s long inquiry , pardoning six people who had served in the reagan administration one who was pardoned was former defense secretary caspar w weinberger , who was then facing trial as the first cabinet member indicted in the affair , on charges of lying to congress about the iran arms sales and efforts by other countries to finance the contras in february mr walsh said in an interim report to congress that mr bush pardoned mr weinberger to prevent a trial that could have exposed how top reagan officials engaged in a coverup to protect mr reagan from possible charges of wrongdoing a theme mr walsh is expected to deal with in further detail in the final report the judicial panel has never before released a prosecutor s final report on a largescale inquiry the judges appear determined to avoid premature disclosures to news organizations , trying to avoid a repeat of disclosures like those in july 1988 , when parts of the independent prosecutor james c mckay s report on the financial dealings of former attorney general edwin meese 3d were reported by news organizations before the report was made public but some lawyers have said the current panel of judges has carried fears about confidentiality too far their action stems from a section of the law on independent counsels that requires prosecutors to report to congress their findings about people who were found to have broken the law but were not charged with wrongdoing
in one of the most decisive moves it has ever made to combat shrinking market share , the new york stock exchange will cut certain customer transaction costs about 15 percent , william donaldson , chairman , said yesterday based on last year s volume , the change in pricing would pare such costs about 185 million for trades of fewer than 2 , 100 shares placed through the big board s computerized order system , mr donaldson said if volume grows in those trades , which are usually placed by individual investors , then the savings will increase , presumably giving the exchange the ability for further cuts none of the saving , to begin feb 1 , is likely to be passed by member firms to the investing public in the form of lower commissions rather , the big board is merely recognizing the financial reality that brokerage firms can and do execute trades in new york stock exchange issues off the exchange for less money the proposal is part of a broad plan to help the exchange recapture the volume of orders lost in recent years to regional exchanges and computerizedtrading systems the other proposals , which include reducing the turnaround time for orders and allowing new types of trades , are included in proposals submitted for approval to the securities and exchange commission the prime target of the plan , which was assembled by an exchange committee over the last year , are the trades at the low end of the scale , ranging from 100 shares to 2 , 099 that range has been the area where the new york stock exchange has seen the greatest loss what we are trying to do is increase the order flow at the low end of the order segment , mr donaldson said having a presence in all of the order segments is very important to the exchange and its customers through the plan , the big board is effectively admitting that strong action is called for to halt the decline in orders exchange officials have said that order flow would return or at least the decline in the big board s market share would slow down because of the quality of the big board s trading systems but that position proved untenable many brokerage firms established their own market makers elsewhere , such as at the stock exchanges in cincinnati and boston , providing extra revenue for handling customer transactions senior wall street executives praised the big board for reversing its strategy carrying out the plan i look at this as a traditional exchange finally saying , 'hey , we have got to be part of the 90 s and focus on the needs of our client base , ' said joseph grano , head of the retail division at paine webber , who worked with the exchange on its proposal by reducing customer transaction costs , the exchange will be simultaneously reducing its own revenue but because specialists have agreed as part of the plan to pay an additional 9 million in fees , only about half of that revenue cut will affect the big board s bottom line the exchange will put the cut in place by increasing a credit given to brokerage firms that place orders in the big board s orderexecution computer system the current credit is 30 cents against a full transaction charge under the new proposal , it will increase to 160 a number of retail brokerage officials said the cut in transaction costs was likely to strongly influence their decisions on where they directed order flow but they added that they did not expect the new plan to prevent them from using regional exchanges as they have in the past it is n't going to stop us from sending orders to cincinnati or boston or the pacific , mr grano said but i think it will preclude a lot of growth in diverted order flow the other proposals are less dramatic in their implications the big board plans to quicken the pace of turnarounds in orders by imposing new rules at the exchange on average , orders are now executed within about 29 seconds under the new rules , that would be cut to 15 seconds the exchange also plans to disseminate preopening prices of stock more broadly throughout the floor with an internal communication system under the new plans , it will also allow traders to place orders to be executed , if possible , at the market close at or below a set price graph shrinking market shows percentage of activity in nyse issues handled by the big board from '81 to '91 \( source new york stock exchange \)

washington , april 7 several old bills are coming due at the department of housing and urban development , and the costs are frustrating the clinton administration s hopes of rapidly expanding federal housing aid a combination of new laws , old decisions , deferred expenses , poor management , and the quirks of federal accounting are forcing the department to seek tens of billions of dollars in expanded budget authority over the next few years just to house the families it is now assisting this reduces its ability to offer rent subsidies to the millions of families that qualify for aid but are forced to wait as long as a decade because of the lack of government financing only part of the ballooning ledger represents new annual expenses a larger portion stems from bookkeeping rules that require the department to account in a single year for money that will be spent over several years but taken together , the numbers to be released thursday when president clinton offers his budget for the fiscal year 1994 present a gloomy fiscal forecast for secretary henry g cisneros the bad news comes after 12 years in which democrats promised to reverse republican housing policies they blamed for homelessness and urban distress just to keep the same number of families housed continues to cost more money into the future , said herb persil , the department s budget director if you want to add additional families , that just adds to the problem the general accounting office , a congressional arm not noted for its florid language , recently warned that the financial pressures will only worsen an already dismal situation last summer , a senate appropriations subcommittee called the figures staggering the sudden fiscal constraints come after two decades of worsening conditions for lowincome renters though federal housing assistance has been expanding , the number of needy renters has been growing even faster the department provides aid to about 45 million families , either through conventional public housing or programs that subsidize families living in private apartments but the department estimates that as many as 13 million more families qualify for housing assistance , which unlike cash welfare or food stamps is limited each year by congressional appropriations and about 51 million of those families are considered to have worst case needs this means their annual household incomes fall below ceilings that , depending on the city , average about 19 , 000 for a family of four in addition , these families live in severely substandard conditions or spend more than half their income on rent and utilities the amount we need is far beyond what we 're going to be able to get in the foreseeable future , said representative barney frank , democrat of massachusetts , a housing expert the bookkeeping problem much of the budgetary concern centers on the department s section 8 program , which provides subsidies to 27 million families living in private apartments the families pay 30 percent of their income on rent , and the government pays landlords an additional stipend , pegged to local housing costs when the program began in the mid1970 s , the government financed it mostly through 15year contracts , which have begun to expire in large numbers federal budgeting rules require that the entire multiyear cost of a contract be charged against the department s budget in the year it is renewed , although the money is actually spent over several years five years ago , none of the department s budget authority went toward renewing old contracts now about 7 billion of hud s 25 billion budget in the current fiscal year is allotted to the renewals , and the department expects that figure to grow to more than 15 billion by 1997 to reduce the cost of the contracts , hud has shortened their length to five years as a result , the department will soon have to begin renewing its renewals mr frank , among others , argues that such numbers are largely an accounting problem that exaggerates the situation while hud s budget authority will have to grow by leaps and bounds over the next few years to renew the contracts , the actual spending in any given year remains steady , rising only in rough step with inflation can we find the budget authority \? yeah , he said but some housing experts take a different view , saying the need for budget authority throws hud into fierce competition with other , more popular agencies it s a major problem , said cushing n dolbeare , a housing consultant and longtime advocate for lowincome housing under current law , the government s overall budget authority is capped every year , meaning increases at hud must come from decreases elsewhere the law expires in 1995 , giving congress the chance to write in new assumptions that account for the expiring contracts 'preserving' cheap housing a second area costing the government large new sums involves what are called preservation properties , referring to hundreds of thousands of apartments for lowincome families built beginning in the late 1960 s with governmentsubsidized loans
the sharp cuts in new york city s sanitation budget during the fiscal crises of 199091 have hit poor , minority residents far harder than wealthier ones , scarring onceorderly blocks in neighborhoods like harlem , bedfordstuyvesant and the south bronx with garbage collection , sweeping and enforcement steadily scaled back , the number of the city s 59 sanitation districts rated dirty by the mayor s office has jumped from 1 to 12 since 1987 the dirty districts are all economically depressed areas with mostly black and hispanic populations in west harlem , the percentage of streets rated acceptably clean by the city dropped from 588 in 1987 to 394 this year in the south bronx , the percentage decreased from 598 to 38 the rating in bedfordstuyvesant , brooklyn , declined from 553 to 464 a district is considered dirty if fewer than 50 percent of its streets are rated acceptably clean during monthly surveys by inspectors who assign grades based on visual examinations poor areas more vulnerable the drops in poor neighborhoods have occurred even as the city overall has weathered the sanitation cuts fairly well the citywide average for all 59 sanitation districts has remained steady in recent years about 70 to 75 percent of the city s streets are rated acceptably clean sanitation department officials maintain that they have spread service reductions evenly around the city but they acknowledge that poor neighborhoods have suffered more because overcrowding , shoddy apartment maintenance and a surfeit of vacant lots and abandoned buildings make them more vulnerable to sanitation problems there are a lot of conditions in these districts that are tough to correct , said john j doherty , the deputy sanitation commissioner for operations but community leaders in these areas scoff at those explanations , contending that the city has long devoted proportionally fewer resources to the sanitation needs of poor residents the budget cuts , they say , have merely dealt another blow to fragile neighborhoods already reeling from decades of indifference 'there has never been a will' there has never been a will to keep harlem clean , said stephen roberson , an organizer at harlem initiatives together , a citizens' lobbying group you 're asking me to differentiate between a time when they did n't want to keep this area clean and now , when they do n't want to keep it clean even more the sanitation department received some of the most severe cuts of any city agency in 199091 its budget in fiscal year 1988 was 5638 million the projected budget for fiscal year 1994 is 5986 million , which actually represents a decline of about 16 percent from 1988 when inflation is factored in the latter figure also includes money for the city s recycling program , which was not in place in the 1980 s perhaps the harshest service reduction was the elimination of the clean teams crews that roamed the city on foot with trash cans and brooms , picking up refuse from streets and sidewalks in 1987 , there were 1 , 400 such workers now , there are none many of our cleaners were in these poorer districts , so we were able to keep these districts out of the filthy category , mr doherty said but when the clean teams left , that had a big impact that is readily apparent during a morning stroll around west harlem with peggy shepard , cofounder of a citizens' group called west harlem environmental action at the corner of broadway and west 152d street , ms shepard gingerly circled a gutter clogged with so many fastfood wrappings , newspapers , beer bottles and chicken bones that it looked like a roadside waste pit think about the children in this area , she said when they walk through a trashstrewn neighborhood every day , sooner or later they are going to wonder , 'why is there so much trash \? maybe i'm trash , too' and then , turning away as if she could no longer bear the sight of so much decay , she added defiantly you would n't see this on columbus avenue downtown private crews community leaders like ms shepard maintain that the service reductions are not only ravaging their streets and sidewalks , but are also giving rise to a kind of sanitation segregation in some prosperous neighborhoods , business improvement districts private groups financed by surtaxes on businesses are hiring their own sanitation workers to cushion the blow from the cuts in midtown manhattan , for example , these crews have reclaimed streets that were once considered among the city s filthiest but poor areas have become dirtier because residents cannot afford to turn to the private sector to keep their streets clean they also have less political influence , so they have trouble lobbying for and obtaining scarce city services , the community leaders say this is basically the message now from the city those who have the money and power can expect certain services , said luis garden acosta , executive director of el puente , a community development group in williamsburg , a heavily hispanic section of brooklyn widening gap

dallas , march 21 six years after the wife of a prominent dallas minister was found nearly choked to death in the family s garage and left in a coma from which she has never recovered , a jury is finally about to explore the question that this city has debated with a morbid and seemingly endless fascination ever since did the minister try to kill her \? the defendant , walker l railey , who resigned as senior minister at the 6 , 200member first united methodist church of dallas in the controversy that followed the attack , will go on trial this week on a charge of attempted murder a jury is being selected in san antonio , where the trial was moved because of the intense publicity here , and opening arguments are expected as early as wednesday with that , it will finally become clear what evidence prosecutors assembled to prompt the sudden and mysterious indictment of dr railey last august , several years after they said they lacked the proof to convict him ordered not to comment both the prosecutor , cecil emerson , and dr railey s lawyer , douglas d mulder , are under a judicial order not to discuss the trial outside of court but the evidence might include testimony from the raileys' son , ryan , who was 5 years old at the time of the attack and who is believed to have witnessed part of it he once told investigators , maybe daddy did it but he has also given several other conflicting accounts and at one point was considered an unreliable witness another possibility is that improvements in dna testing in the years since the attack could be used in an effort to establish that dr railey had licked the envelopes containing racist hate notes that were mailed to his dallas home in the days before his wife was attacked the minister , who is white , was an outspoken foe of racial prejudice , and he suggested to the police after the attack that it had been carried out by whitesupremacist groups that he said had been threatening them dr railey s wife , peggy , a professional organist and the mother of their two children , has been in a vegetative state ever since the attack doctors say she has no chance of recovery and thus can never identify her assailant might have been bishop meanwhile , the 45yearold defendant , once a spellbinding orator who seemed well on his way to becoming a bishop and perhaps even the national leader of his church , has been through a personal and professional odyssey in the last few years he has resigned his church position , written a despondent note in which he said there was a demon inside my soul , attempted suicide , surrendered custody of his children , moved to california with his mistress and tried , without success , to divorce his comatose wife now he is back in texas , in the san antonio courtroom , insisting on his innocence prosecutors stunned dallas when they announced soon after the 1987 attack that dr railey was their prime suspect they suggested he had schemed to kill his wife , win his congregation s sympathy and , later on , marry his mistress , a twicedivorced dallas psychologist who legally changed her last name to papillon \( french for butterfly \) to reflect what she once said was the metamorphosis of my spirit circumstantial evidence but with no fingerprints uncovered at the crime scene \( mrs railey was choked with a cord \) , and with the raileys' young son apparently unable to give a coherent account of the crime , the evidence against the minister was always circumstantial prosecutors uncovered inconsistencies in dr railey s account of where he was at the time of the attempted murder \( he said he was studying in the library at southern methodist university \) and brought in experts to declare that the threatening notes delivered to him had been composed on a typewriter in his church office none of this produced an indictment , at least for several years it was enough , though , to persuade a civil court judge in 1988 to hold the minister liable for his wife s injuries he ordered dr railey to pay 165 million to her parents , bill and billie jo nicolai , who had assumed care of her dr railey has said he is destitute and has not paid anything on the judgment under texas law , the civil lawsuit required only a preponderance of credible evidence to find dr railey liable in criminal cases , proof beyond a reasonable doubt is needed to convict wore bulletproof vest when the police found mrs railey unconscious in the garage early on the morning of april 22 , 1987 , it appeared at first that the crime could have well been carried out by the hate groups that dr railey said were harassing him the minister gave the police six threatening notes he said he had recently received one said , on easter christ rose from the dead and on this day you are going down dr railey went to preach at his church on the easter sunday before the attack wearing a bulletproof vest beneath his robes many local religious leaders believed at first that the attack on mrs railey had indeed been the work of bigots but prosecutors quickly uncovered what they said were inconsistencies in dr railey s account for one thing , he had neglected to tell them that he had spent part of the evening at the home of ms papillon , the daughter of a former methodist bishop the numbers were wrong in addition , dr railey suggested he had an alibi in a telephone message that he had left on the family answering machine around 10 30 , believed to be the time of the attack hi , babe , the message said i'm calling you from my mobile phone peg , it s about , oh , i do n't know , i do n't have a watch it s somewhere between 10 30 and 10 45 my concern is that you 're safe but phone records subsequently showed that the call was placed at 12 03 am , well after the attack about a week and a half after the attack , just as prosecutors were preparing to question dr railey further , he tried to kill himself with an overdose of tranquilizers a note complained of the demon inside my soul and said forgive me for the pain i inflict on so many i have finally made the decision to take care of myself i have grown weak god has remained strong therein lies your hope but he recovered , and after several weeks at a psychiatric hospital he headed for california , insisting on his innocence i did n't do anything to my wife , and i did n't plan for anybody to do anything to my wife , he told reporters at the time now , at last , a criminal court jury will decide whether that was the case the maximum penalty on conviction is 20 years in prison and a 10 , 000 fine the burden of proof remains much higher than in the civil lawsuit against dr railey , and the core question remains what new evidence has emerged since prosecutors originally decided against pressing charges at the time of the civil judgment , the assistant district attorney in charge of the criminal case , norman kinne , said a conviction would be difficult there was no new evidence , he said of the civil trial there s a big jump between proving you lied about telephone calls and proving you strangled your wife photo walker l railey , left , arriving yesterday for jury selection in his trial in san antonio

the new group that won the fight to sponsor this year s st patrick s day parade may withdraw rather than face an embarrassing boycott over its inclusion of a gay and lesbian contingent , leaders in the irishamerican community said yesterday the withdrawal could put the parade back in the hands of its traditional organizers , who want to exclude homosexuals at a meeting on monday , charles j hynes , the district attorney and a leader of the new group , told john cardinal o'connor that his organization would defer to the ancient order of hibernians if the hibernians could resolve a dispute within the group over whether it can sponsor parades , said representative peter t king , republican of seaford , who attended the session if the sponsors withdraw , the dinkins administration might once again have to decide whether to grant a parade permit to the hibernians , who would exclude a gay group from marching under its own banner , or not to have a parade at all mr dinkins has long opposed the antigay stance of the hibernians , and he supported the permit application of the new group , the st patrick s day parade committee inc , made up mostly of liberal allies of his who had said they would permit the irish lesbian and gay organization to march under its own banner in violation of law when police commissioner raymond w kelly awarded the permit to the parade committee on jan 8 , he said it could not go to the hibernians because of a ruling by the new york city human rights commission that the hibernians' exclusion of the gay group violated the city s antidiscrimination law yesterday , mr dinkins , who was in washington for a meeting of urban mayors and the inauguration ceremonies , said we have taken our stand , we 've issued a permit to one group if that group goes ahead with the parade , then fine if that group decides not to , then obviously we have to determine to whom to issue a permit but i ca n't withdraw a permit we have issued the manhattan chapter of the hibernians has coordinated the parade since the 1850 s , but at a national meeting last summer , the hibernians amended their constitution to rule out parade sponsorship hibernian officials said the manhattan unit could put on the parade if it obtained permission from the national leadership , or if it incorporated itself under a different name to shield the hibernians from the legal expenses that have piled up during the twoandahalfyear dispute over the exclusion of homosexuals the manhattan chapter sought to run the parade , though it had not met either condition on monday , mr hynes told the cardinal that if the national hibernians want the parade back , they would step aside , said congressman king , who was the grand marshal of the parade in 1985 mr king , who has not been involved in the parade dispute , said that he attended the meeting at mr hynes s request , and that he believed the parade should be left with the hibernians calls to both mr hynes and george j clough jr , national president of the hibernians , were not returned appeals to cardinal the hibernians and cardinal o'connor have said there is no place for a gay contingent in the parade because it is a catholic event and the church teaches that homosexual acts are sinful officials of the irishamerican groups that traditionally send some of the largest contingents to the annual march on fifth avenue the hibernians , emerald societies and the irish county societies have said they expected their groups to boycott the event if a gay group marched in a fullpage advertisement in yesterday s irish echo , an irish community newspaper based in manhattan , the national governing board of the hibernians said that none of its units may march in a parade with any group whose main purpose is to extol a life style that is contrary to the teachings of the catholic church individuals may march , the statement said , if they are not identifiable as hibernians leaders of the parade committee , many of whom are hibernians , have stated recently that they formed the group not out of a desire to protect gay rights , but because they feared that the hibernian rules change meant there would be no parade

beijing , sept 11 a provincial coach from northeastern china , whose female runners have been bursting past world records , lashed out tonight at those who attribute his team s remarkable success to performanceenhancing drugs he said , instead , that he had been feeding his athletes an expensive potion made from a rare worm found on china s western high plateau in a rambling news conference in which he blasted critics of his team , the coach , ma junren , also criticized coaches of china s national team for trying to steal his best runners , disrupting their concentration and , generally , not recognizing his genius it seemed ma was mad at almost everyone , except my girls he said his runners would keep breaking world records all the way to the 1996 summer olympics in atlanta ma so dominated the news conference that his champions were not allowed to answer questions the coach gestured and shouted at a roomful of chinese and western reporters and even hawked his secret potions and training techniques to the highest bidder he was trying to raise money , he said , so he could underwrite the cost of feeding worm elixirs and soups made from soft shell river turtles to his athletes if anyone is interested in us , we always need funds to buy turtles , he said another record falls the news conference was called on a day when one of his liaoning province team members , 20yearold qu junxia , set a world record in the women s 1 , 500 meter run by more than two seconds during the 7th national games under way here qu , the 21yearold world champion in the 3 , 000 meters , ran the 1 , 500 meters in 3 5046 seconds qu broke the previous record of 3 5247 set by tatanya kazankina of the former soviet union on aug 13 , 1980 , in zurich barely a halfsecond behind qu was another liaoning team member , wang junxia , whose 3 5192 also broke the ous record it was wang who startled the track world this past wednesday when she became the first women to break 30 minutes in the 10 , 000meter run by shearing 42 seconds off of the world record in a sport where world records often come in increments of hundreths and tenths of seconds , and on a great day by a full second or two , wang s performance was hard to understate overnight , she and qu and the other stars on the liaoning team have become national heroines , and there is a spike of antiwestern sentiment in china this week over the skepticism from abroad that is preventing these chinese champions from fully enjoying their victories 'ugly rumors' ma , addressing what he said were ugly rumors that china had recruited former east german doctors and coaches to develop a secret drug regime to enhance running performance , said we do n't want any east german instruction , none of those east germans have anything to do with us both qu and wang were only allowed to speak for a few seconds during the news conference , and both took the opportunity to deny that they had used any illicit drugs in training this is what i tell my trainees to drink , ma said holding up a box of the wormderived potion this is all natural and chinese people have been drinking it for hundreds of years most often used by men as an aphrodisiac , the worm extract comes from the dong qiong sya cao , worm , whose name in a literal translation means , winterbugsummergrass chinese familiar with the herbal medicine said it can be bought at high prices at most traditionalmedicine pharmacies in china the worm thrives in summer on the highaltitude plateau of qinhai and gansu provinces it dies in winter and is gathered before the first snows by local farmers , who sell the twiglike , one or twoinch long carcasses into the herbal medicine market hard work is the key ma held aloft test results from china s sports medicine laboratories during the news conference and asserted that both national tests and recent tests in stuttgart , germany , during the recent world championships proved that none of his runners used any illicit drug and that his herbal potions were perfectly legal the real secret to the success of his athletes , coach ma said , was hard work , running at least a marathon s distance \( 262 miles \) per day , often at high altitudes , and applying the running technology of the sika deer and the ostrich the liaoning province runners , whose ranks have grown from five to 18 under coach ma , are known as ma s army , and most of them come from peasant families ma likes to say that he selects the kind of girls who can eat bitterness , which means endure the hardship of his training regime
washington , feb 18 the political debate over the budget began in earnest today as republicans said president clinton wanted to raise taxes without reducing government spending enough and the president defended his program for improving the economy the debate over the president s program , on capitol hill and around the country , was fueled by new figures published by the white house showing that almost all the deficit reduction proposed for the next two years in the package mr clinton outlined wednesday would come from tax increases , with almost none from spending cuts the new , more complete budget tables made public today also showed clearly just how much the deficit would be cut under the clinton plan instead of the 500 billion reduction over four years that was emphasized in some documents wednesday and reported by the new york times and some other news organizations , the cumulative reduction would be 325 billion , figuring in new spending the president proposes cabinet on the road mr clinton promoted his plan at a rally in st louis , his first stop in a twoday trip to missouri , ohio and upstate new york almost all the members of his cabinet and many other top officials were also on the road today to pitch the proposals by the end of the day , administration officials had appeared in more than 25 states meanwhile , treasury secretary lloyd bentsen and the budget director , leon e panetta , went before the congressional budget committees , the first step in what will probably be a tortuous journey as congress deals with the proposals congressional democrats were largely supportive of the president today , but republicans took aim at what they called insufficient spending cuts the bond market showed strong support for the president the 30year treasury bond , the best gauge of the longterm interest rates that must drop if mr clinton s economic program is to succeed , fell to 702 percent , the lowest since the government began selling such securities in 1977 page d1 mr clinton acknowledged the republican criticism in his speech at union station in st louis , but he and his cabinet secretaries maintained that the new government spending they sought was a new kind of spending a down payment on jobs and economic growth , not money to finance wasteful consumption today i do propose to spend some more money , mr clinton said , but not in the old way look at what we spend it for we have reduced government consumption we have reduced inessential programs but we increased spending on jobs , a jobs program to create a half a million jobs starting right now in building roads , repairing streets , fixing airports , cleaning up the environment with water systems and sewer systems , a million summer jobs for young people , if i can get the private sector to contribute to the 700 , 000 we 're going to create in the government overnight polls showed strong support for the president a cnn usa today telephone poll of 514 adults who said they watched the address wednesday night found that 79 percent supported mr clinton s plan , while 16 percent opposed it mr clinton s package , the toughest budgetcutting program proposed by a president since world war ii , would raise taxes and lower government spending so that the annual deficit , now more than 300 billion , would be reduced by 140 billion by the 1997 fiscal year , the last of mr clinton s term over five years , the deficit reduction would come almost equally from spending cuts and tax increases the main elements would be higher income taxes on families with incomes above about 180 , 000 , new taxes on energy that would cost most families 100 to 150 a year , reduced military spending , a freeze in the pay of government workers , limits in medicare and medicaid payments to doctors and hospitals and relatively small spending cuts in many other government programs the budget documents published today show that while the deficit would be cut by 39 billion next year and 54 billion in 1995 , government spending , now more than 1 trillion a year , would be reduced by only 5 billion next year and 6 billion in 1995 all the rest of the deficit reduction in those years would be accomplished by tax increases only in the last two years of mr clinton s term would spending cuts begin to bite the politics of economics questions about taxes and spending have been the main battleground of partisan conflict in american politics over the last two decades when republicans have been able to persuade the public that taxes were being wasted , they have generally been elected when democrats have been able to show that the government was paying insufficient attention to the public s needs , they have normally won in their appearances before the congressional committees , mr panetta and mr bentsen were assailed by republicans as being big taxers and spenders in a typical exchange , representative john r kasich of ohio , the ranking republican on the house budget committee , declared what i 'd like to know is what the heck went wrong in year 1 \? why not have the cuts now and the taxes later rather than what we always see , which are the taxes now \? in response , mr panetta argued that deep cuts in spending now would cause even greater consternation with regards to the economy mr panetta was chairman of the budget committee until he left congress this year to join the clinton administration normally mild and affable , he is popular among democrats and republicans but in exasperation today , he finally told the republicans , you are the perfect example of the gridlock the american people are tired of in the senate hearing , mr bentsen challenged the republicans to name the precise places they wanted to cut spending the treasury secretary , a senator from texas before he joined the cabinet , was questioned sharply about his assertion that an increase in the taxes on social security payments received by affluent retirees was a spending cut and not a tax increase mr bentsen said it was properly characterized as a spending cut because social security benefits would , in effect , be taken back by the government at a breakfast meeting with reporters , vice president al gore said that the administration was prepared to work with congress on modifications in the economic plan but that the main components all have to be there in order for the plan to be successful while it is far too early to gauge how the clinton plan will fare in congress , the administration could take heart that the criticism came almost entirely from republicans the democratic leaders in the senate and house went out of their way to praise the program and to emphasize the importance of demonstrating that the president and congress could work together for the good of the country some democratic backbenchers objected to particular proposals that would harm their constituents for example , senator kent conrad of north dakota said he was worried about proposed cuts in farm subsidies but the public support for the overall program among democrats was solid , at least for today photo leon e panetta , budget director , testifying before the house budget committee , the first step in what will probably be a tortuous journey as congress deals with president clinton s economic program \( stephen crowley the new york times \) \( pg a14 \)
racing officials , reacting to public concern over fatal injuries to star horses in the preakness stakes last month and the belmont stakes three weeks ago , are exploring a landmark change that would provide more spacing between the races in the triple crown series no new format has been developed , but one racing executive reported that one sequence under discussion was this the kentucky derby would still be run on the first saturday in may , but the preakness would be run one month \( instead of two weeks \) later and the belmont stakes one month \( instead of three weeks \) after that so , instead of three demanding races in five weeks' time , the races would be spread over eight weeks' time this was a tragic year , joe defrancis , the president of pimlico race course , said yesterday from baltimore we talk about ways of improving the triple crown every year after this year s series , we asked ourselves if we should consider something drastic defrancis said the talks were preliminary , predicted that no snap judgment would be made , and added it s an evolving process we 'll keep talking over the summer and see where it leads us this is one of the most difficult issues we need to address , he said you have 125 years of tradition on the one hand and , on the other hand , the major leagues are expanding in all sports change is something not to be feared jerry lawrence , executive vice president of the new york racing association , doubted there was any unified push for a change but he conceded that what happened this year brings the subject up i do n't think the spacing of the races caused the injuries to those two horses this year , he said but it s true the public perception may be otherwise , and it can be powerful the only change i 'd favor personally is to equalize the spacing put three weeks between the derby and the preakness , and leave three weeks between the preakess and the belmont and karl schmitt , vice president of churchill downs , said from louisville , i do n't think the talk has reached any governing bodies yet , but there s been much talk by many people about changing the triple crown races do n't forget , they used to run the kentucky derby at a mile and a half , and it s been run on every day of the week except sunday racing people have argued the merits of the triple crown for years most agree that the series poses the ultimate challenge for 3yearold horses , three classic races at three different distances at three tracks the kentucky derby at a mile and a quarter at churchill downs , the preakness at a mile and threesixteenths at pimlico and the belmont stakes at a mile and a half at belmont park in new york only 11 horses have swept all three races since they were inaugurated more than a century ago , and none since affirmed did it in 1978 over the years , though , the races individually have undergone changes in distance , spacing and even format the belmont , for instance , was run clockwise in the english fashion until 1921 , and has been run as early as may 24 and as late as june 23 centerpiece of racing year but for the last 40 years , the three classics have become stabilized as the centerpiece of the racing year for 3yearold horses however , the public s sensitivity has been jolted several times in recent years , mostly in races carried on national television the filly ruffian shattered a foreleg and did not survive her match race at belmont park with foolish pleasure , the winner of the kentucky derby , in 1975 the filly go for wand fractured a foreleg near the finish line of the breeders' cup distaff in 1990 , also at belmont the distinguished british jockey lester piggott was seriously injured when his mount broke down during the breeders' cup sprint at gulfstream park last year but the public seemed even more shaken when two horses broke down in the triple crown series this spring during the preakness on may 15 , the colt union city fractured a leg and did not survive three weeks later in the belmont on june 5 , the favorite prairie bayou fractured a leg and did not survive d wayne lukas , the trainer of union city , speaking by telephone from his barn at santa anita yesterday , insisted again that his colt had not entered the preakness with any soreness or injury but he also said again that he favored changes in the triple crown sequence his own formula run the kentucky derby at a mile and an eighth , then three weeks later run the preakness at its present distance of a mile and threesixteenths , and then the belmont three weeks after that at a mile and a quarter remember , a 3yearold horse is a baby , he said , and you 're getting him ready to go a mile and a quarter in early may if it was n't the triple crown , you could n't get a lot of trainers to do it no , i do n't think more time between races would have saved union city or prairie bayou but there is a wear and tear in racing competition , as in all sports trainers tell you to give them another week and they 'll fix charles barkley s elbow time , wayne lukas said , is your ally veterinarian begs to differ however , a dissenting opinion was voiced by dr manuel a gilman , who served as chief veterinarian at new york s tracks for 32 years and for seven as a steward until he retired last year if your horse is sound , gilman said , the triple crown sequence is not dangerous two weeks is a normal time between races remember , there used to be four weeks between the preakness and the belmont , and ben jones ran citation in the jersey derby in 1948 as a workout between the two big races , and he won them all the accidents do not suggest any basic flaw in the triple crown sequence prairie bayou was sound he just took a bad step if you simply spaced the races out by a week or two , some horses would break down for some other reason , or they 'd start coughing no , it s not an impossible dream to run a sound horse in the kentucky derby and two weeks later in the preakness and three weeks after that in the belmont meanwhile , television officials remained vague on changing the dates there have been some discussions within the horse racing industry and among television executives about how to improve thoroughbred racing , said mark mandel , an abc spokesman some of the discussions we 've been involved in and some we have n't , but to get specific about the discussions is premature
tampa , fla , march 12 stepping up the white house s campaign for vast changes in the nation s healthcare system , hillary rodham clinton listened to testimony today from several dozen floridians invited to share medical horror stories , complaints and ideas on how things could work better the daylong event , the first of four organized by the robert wood johnson foundation in support of the white house effort , was called conversations on health a dialogue with the american people , a title suggesting its essential political point the crucial discussions shaping the health policy that the clinton administration intends to unveil in the first week of may are taking place in private , among the 15 working groups that make up the task force headed by mrs clinton but if that policy is to win congressional approval despite criticism from interest groups and conservatives , and if it is to convince a skeptical public that the federal government can manage private health care competently , the white house must show persuasive evidence that the plan truly reflects what people want businesses complain comments by carol roush , the owner of a small communications company in tarpon springs , were typical of those of several business owners who said that the mounting costs of providing health insurance for their employees were driving them out of business the cost is astronomical , and none of us can afford it , ms roush said and anyone with a preexisting condition simply ca n't get insurance something has to be done bill mauk , an executive of the john alden life insurance company , asked mrs clinton for a plan that would provide a system where administrative costs come under control , enforced by topdown planning and augmented by reform in the civil judiciary system covering malpractice suits physicians do things not because they know they are effective but because they know they might be challenged later on , mr mauk said personal horror stories the most compelling witnesses , however , were not business executives or health care professionals but people who testified to the havoc and suffering wrought in their own lives by medical costs there was a union carpenter who had been forced to go without health insurance rather than take a cut in salary there was a 46yearold cancer patient who was facing a new round of chemotherapy treatment without benefit of health insurance a 45yearold orlando woman confined to a wheelchair by muscular dystrophy told of her struggle to getmedicaid to cover some of her medicalrelated living costs and a lawyer spoke on behalf of a 31yearold mother of three who had been paralyzed in an automobile accident and left with medical costs that reached as much as 1 million a year pat hackettwaters of orlando talked about her son who has had a muscle disease for 19 years in 1978 we bought his first motorized wheelchair and it cost 1 , 500 , she said the insurance paid 90 percent , and we paid 150 three years ago a new motorized wheelchair cost 15 , 000 , and the insurance was willing to pay only 350 for those prices he should have a van with airconditioning the angriest testimony came from dr roman hendrickson , president of the florida academy of family physicians he seemed almost to lecture mrs clinton i do n't want to be my patients' gatekeeper , he said , speaking against the concept of governmentmanaged care let some nameless , faceless bureaucrat on the other end of the phone do that and do it very well at this hearing , though , there was a nearunanimity that illustrated the limits of public involvement in the white house healthcare project the hearings put together by the johnson foundation appear as public events but are actually by invitation only , with panelists and audience members selected from a list put together by the foundation with at least some guidance by the white house the foundation , one of the largest private philanthropic groups devoted to healthcare issues , proposed the idea of the hearings to the white house although steven schroeder , the president of the johnson foundation , was chairman of the meeting , mrs clinton was indisputably the center of attention taking copious notes , she led what limited questioning there was of those who testified , and opened and closed the hearing with brief remarks that underscored the point that she was seeking public involvement and consensus searching for right move we came to learn and to exchange ideas and points of view that will assist the president , from my perspective , in making sure the proposals he will present to congress and the american people are fully informed , she said i do n't think there is any doubt the american public does want fundamental healthcare reform but she said that the american people want to be sure we move in the right direction , adding , we have a population of about 250 millionamericans , and we have 250 million experts on health care the event today was videotaped by a camera crew hired by the foundation and made available without cost by satellite to television stations around the country a lot of people think these hearings are public hearings because mrs clinton is involved , said john hoyt , a seattle public relations consultant who helped organize the tampa event we have had to spend a lot of time telling people that they are not , and that not everyone can attend photo hillary rodham clinton after arriving yesterday in tampa , fla , where she listened to testimony on problems in health care and medical insurance

stratford , ontario three times a week , at the cavernlike festival theater of the stratford festival , miss mazeppa , the trumpetplaying stripper of gypsy , is belting out a legendary piece of showbusiness advice you gotta have a gimmick , if you want to get ahead doubtless , this is counsel that the festival organizers have wearily and repeatedly considered over the 41 years of the institution s history with minimal government subsidies for the arts , which now represent less than 10 percent of the festival s budget , and a discouraging 7 percent increase in ticket prices dictated by canada s grumbleprovoking goods and services tax , the stratford festival , which runs a narrowing but continuing deficit , has got to get a very big audience and the ecdysiast is right to get that audience particularly after repeated productions of the shakespearean standards that made the festival s name you gotta have that gimmick , or , indeed , many gimmicks it represents no small achievement that the festival can report that it will probably take in its largest boxoffice grosses ever this year while this season offers none of the stars with guaranteed drawing power alec guinness , james mason , maggie smith and brian bedford who have trodden the boards here in years past , the festival has inaugurated several popular discount programs its gift shop is well stocked with groovyclassical tshirts \( one , showing shakespeare in sunglasses , reads rebel with applause \) , coffee mugs and umbrellas and in his last year as artistic director here , david william , who will be succeeded by richard monette , has carefully created a somethingforeveryone schedule of plays they are clearly intended for an audience , a majority of which comes from within a 150mile radius , that janice price , the director of marketing and communications , admits is innately conservative the resulting program , performed in the festival s three theaters throughout the small town of stratford , is innocuously entertaining at its worst and gently thoughtprovoking at its best while shakespeare himself takes a back seat \( the company is no longer called the stratford shakespeare festival \) to such crowdpleasing warhorses as gypsy , the mikado and the importance of being earnest , the bard is represented by antony and cleopatra , king john and the perennial midsummer night s dream more adventurous are the productions of euripides' bacchae , costumed with atavistic variations on classical masks a new historical play set in canada after the american revolution , fair liberty s call , by sharon pollock , and the young company s spirited interpretation of the illusion , corneille s multilevel \( and suddenly very fashionable \) meditation on the beguilingly deceptive art of the theater after robin phillips s emotionally haunting interpretation of king john , the illusion was the most consistently satisfying of the five productions i saw as directed from ranjit bolt s gleefully rhymed translation by marti maraden , it skirts the play s more academic complexities to focus on a bright , broadly comic style that suggests the lighter works of moliere the casting is unbalanced in the dominant role of the military braggart , matamore , matthew penn overplays cravenness and underplays braggadocio , diluting the linguistic pleasures of his exaggerated , selfapotheosizing monologues and as the the scheming maid lyse , yanna mcintosh is so vibrant and forceful that she becomes , by default , the play s center , which is rather like despina s becoming the star of cosi fan tutti all the same , the jokes read clearly , the pace is swift and the play s conclusion , which involves actors' shedding their identities on at least three levels , is a sentimental triumph , a metaphorical reminder of the particular joys of repertory , in which we are able to see the same actors repeatedly reincarnated from play to play for the bacchae , directed by mr william and the festival s first major staging of a greek tragedy since james mason suffered epically through oedipus rex in the 1950 s , the greatest innovations are in alan barlow s design the bright , eerie masks , costumes and serpentineswirled setting suggest a bizarre melding of the chthonic and the contemporary the effect can , initially , be ludicrous the appropriately epicene dionysus \( played with insinuating swagger by the invaluable colm feore \) recalls jeff koons s sculptures of his wife , the italian porn star cicciolina , and the chorus of women under the god s saturnalian sway sometimes suggest a tribal drill team moreover , the actors have n't found voices to match the mythic grandeur of their costumes , and the effect can be reminiscent of a dubbed italian gladiator movie but as this sinister tale of rigid , rational civilization and the dark , primal forces that undermine it unfolds , its hypnotic power takes hold although mr william places acute emphasis on the psychosexual conflicts of the young tyrant pentheus \( ted dykstra \) , this bacchae is a far cry from the blissedout , frenetically sensual productions that were popular \( for obvious reasons \) in the late 1960 s
you do n't hear much about suzuki these days , but japan s no 6 automaker just keeps on truckin' in fact , american sales for 1992 were up 15 percent from the year before , and the company expects '93 results to be 12 percent better than that and while the numbers are not huge 25 , 000 to 30 , 000 vehicles a year any doubledigit increase in today s market is worth noting notable , too , is suzuki s worldwide effort , with sales of more than 833 , 000 cars and trucks in 150 countries the 73yearold company also has assembly plants and joint ventures in 25 of those countries in fact , it may be its partnership with general motors that obscures its presence in the united states not everyone knows , for example , that suzuki makes geo metros and geo trackers for gm or the ways in which they differ from suzuki s own versions of those cars and little sportutilities , the swift , samurai and sidekick but then , too , tiny vehicles do keep a naturally low profile all the same , the sidekick , introduced in october 1990 , feels fairly tall when you motor down the highway it rides on fat 15inch tires , and its traction , low gearing and price also make it one of the least expensive ways to have fourwheel fun in the boondocks the sidekick , which comes in two and fourdoor versions and with two and fourwheel drive , offers three levels of trim , js , jx and jlx , and stickers range from 11 , 449 to 16 , 369 all twodoor versions have canvas tops , while the fourdoor models have steel roofs , and there are few options the fourdoor sidekick , sold only in america , accounts for about half of suzuki s total sales here , and the tester was one of those , a 15 , 779 jlx painted polar white , with blackout trim and chrome molded wheels for '94 , it has been gussied up with a new security alarm and a tilt steering column but , as in the past , there was also a long list of standard equipment , including antilock brakes at the rear , power buttons for the windows , side mirrors and door locks , cruise control , reclining front buckets and a split rear seat the fullsize spare rode on the rear in a locking hard case with sidekick splashed across it and behind the door , which swings from left to right , there was plenty of cargo room expandable to a morethanplenty 45 cubic feet when the rear seat is folded down that seat , incidentally , is reasonably comfortable , although legroom is tight when the buckets are scooted back to accommodate tall occupants up front one wonderful thing about the rear compartment is that the windows go all the way down , something rarely found in today s vehicles all sidekicks have twotone gray vinyl and cloth interiors , and the driver and front passenger are treated to most of the usual creature comforts the sound system is excellent and is prewired for a compactdisk player there is no air bag but , mercifully , there are none of those dangerous and troublesome mechanical seatbelts either the fourspoke wheel is wrapped in vinyl , and the dash beyond includes a tachometer , fuel and temperature gauges and a speedometer that tops out at 90 faster than one probably wants to go in the rather tall and narrow sidekick buttons for the front windows are in the armrests , where they should be , and there is a onepush down function for the driver s window buttons for the rear windows are in the console , along with the shifter either standard or automatic and a lever to lock the vehicle into fourwheel drive there are overhead grab handles for all but the driver , and the dark gray vinyl dash has a large bar in front of the passenger , one that can be held with both hands should the offroading get to be too exuberant a small but deep tray also is molded into the top of the dash , and the glovebox is bigger than some in much larger vehicles the locking glove compartment is also cleverly designed to hold the hood release , an antitheft feature that other manufacturers might want to copy the hood itself must be lifted manually and propped with a rod but it reveals a neat engine compartment with the tiny powerplant mounted fronttorear and affording what would appear to be easy maintenance the engine is aluminum , a 16liter four with 16 valves and multipoint fuel injection it produces 95 horsepower and a somewhat anemic 98 footpounds of torque , but then the vehicle weighs only 2 , 763 pounds , and performance is sufficient if not exactly robust the most expensive sidekick couples the engine to a fourspeed automatic transmission with a selector to choose normal or power modes for better economy or more acceleration the tester , however , was of the fivespeed persuasion , and the stick needed constant stirring to keep the little engine from stumbling even so , the gearing is low , which means engine revs are high , and there is generally a fair amount of sturm und drang under the hood otherwise , though , the sidekick is quiet and wellbehaved on the highway the body , mounted on a frame in the old style of construction , is tight and seems possessed of fewer creaks than i have heard in the past the suspension also is tight and a bit firm combined with the big tires , it yields a jouncy ride but one that compares favorably with most other sportutilities like performance , fuel economy is sufficient if not spectacular it ranges from a low with the fourdoor automatic of 22 miles per gallon , city , and 26 , highway , to a high of 25 and 27 for a twodoor with the stick add the fact that a sidekick s fourwheel drive is there when you need it and you have a vehicle that deserves to be well , your friend and helper the name is just right photo the fourdoor sidekick , sold only in america and only with a steel roof , is suzuki s bestselling model in the united states the twodoor

these are the teams the giants have beaten the chicago bears they are a long way from the days of mike ditka screaming for the refrigerator to go over the top the tampa bay buccaneers does the new healthcare plan provide coverage for the eyes of bucs fans who have to watch that monstrosity \? the los angeles rams they have tried everything to get better except put magic johnson at quarterback they are still mediocre at best talk to any giants player or coach and he will tell you , it is better to be 30 than a skinny 03 , no matter who the opponents might have been true they will also tell you that the good teams beat the bad ones and the giants have certainly done that but those same players and coaches will also tell you that they have n't been truly tested yet they have read the papers and watched the sports shows and listened to the radio and heard what people are saying well , if it is a test the giants and their followers want , school begins on sunday in buffalo forget about the super bowl rematch stuff it is nonsense not needed for motivation i do n't need to go back that far to get motivation , said quarterback phil simms this will simply be a great game between two good teams but the giants are looking at this as the beginning of a threegame stretch that could prove just how good they are and just how legitimate their 30 record is first , they face the bills at loud and wild rich stadium , then come games against washington and philadelphia before the team s second bye week the real season begins now we read and hear things , said linebacker corey miller , we know what people are saying about the teams we played we know that the rams and tampa bay are n't the best teams in the world but we 're still 30 , so we must be doing something right and we also know that beginning with buffalo , these next three games are going to have a big effect on our year these games will tell just how good we 're going to be none of this has gone unnoticed by coach dan reeves this game is a real test for us this week , he said , to see if we belong in that next level of play right now , everybody is saying we 've won three games we should 've won but can we move up and compete with teams that are playoffcontending teams \? we 'll have a good idea these next three weeks because that s what we 'll be playing if we can beat buffalo in buffalo , that would mean we belong in that category of people you have to worry about when you play us worst possible time the giants are catching buffalo at the worst possible time the bills \( 21 \) are coming off a 2213 spanking by the miami dolphins at rich stadium there are a barrage of statistics that do n't bode well for the giants first , the bills have n't lost backtoback games at home since 1985 the bills are also 112 during the regular season against the national football conference since 1990 , and buffalo is 366 over all at home since 1988 with the exception of those super bowl losses , the bills have played very well against the nfc the fans have something to do with it , but i think it s more that our team really gets pumped up when we play at home , said bills quarterback jim kelly the reason for what we did last week , the only thing i can pinpoint , is miami was better on that day that s a fact we 've all stated it the giants will put their nflleading defense , which has held teams to just 213 yards a game and now includes former linebacker carlton bailey , against the bills' highscoring , nohuddle offense mike nolan , the giants' defensive coordinator who is proving to be one of the bright young talents in the game , was at the buffalomiami game picking up a few pointers on how the dolphins controlled buffalo a simple offense basically , the bills' offense is simple one tight end , one back and three wide receivers simple , but potent when the one back is thurman thomas they run thurman right they run thurman left and if that s stopped , they go long to andre reed or hit thomas coming out of the backfield the key for the giants is to stop thomas the dolphins held him to just 46 yards rushing and 17 receiving miami did an excellent job defending him , said nolan there were times when thurman caught the ball and a dolphins player just got him by the shoestring it was close but i'm sure he s frustrated a little bit the one distinct advantage for the giants is that they 've seen the nohuddle before this season , when they played tampa bay of course , tampa bay quarterback craig erickson is n't kelly , but the experience of playing it will help there are even some defensive coordinators in the league who think offenses like the nohuddle as well as the runandshoot are becoming extinct as defenses have caught up with and even passed them but do n't tell that to the giants jim kelly runs his offense better than erickson , said defensive lineman keith hamilton kelly is a great player you can never shut down jim and thurman thomas you can just try to limit them
to the editor cleaning up college football \( editorial , aug 29 \) repeats a common canard when it says , athletes make millions for their schools to the extent that the athletic departments in universities make millions , the funds are retained for the benefit of the athletic departments this , at least , is our experience at the university of illinois none of the revenue of our teams is made available in any way to cover the real costs or budgetary needs of the university , except for costs incurred in the operation of the athletic teams the university , as an educational scholarly enterprise , gains nothing financially from its association with the activities of teams fielded in its name by our athletic department if anything , far too many university resources are spent in support of athletics we could hire a substantial number of much needed faculty members for the value of the time our chancellors and counsels spend dealing with football , haggling with the national collegiate athletic association over rules and debating the ethnic significance of our mascot you are correct that someone is making millions from athletics , and it is a shame that the athletes do not get a cut the beneficiary of these profits , however , is not the operating budget that supports the educational and scholarly mission of the universities emanuel donchin champaign , ill , sept 2 , 1993 the writer is a professor of psychology at the university of illinois
san francisco , july 6 when a gunman began his shooting spree in the halls of the pettit martin law firm here last thursday , his first victims were jack berman and jody jones sposato , who were trying to do what the gunman himself apparently thought he was trying to do fight the system colleagues say mr berman , a lawyer with bronson , bronson mckinnon , had worked hard to persuade his firm to spend less time defending corporations and more time helping people fight former employers ms sposato s case was one of the first in his campaign jack berman was helping jody sposato fight the system , said sarah e robertson , an associate who worked for mr berman it s unfathomable that this madman came in and tried to hurt the system and he got jack and jody the six other people killed by gian luigi ferri last thursday included a secretary , a summer intern and an executive aide two victims were lawyers with pettit martin , which 10 years ago gave mr ferri the advice that he blamed for his financial downfall but neither had had anything to do with that advice and none of the dead or wounded were on a hit list mr ferri had carried in with him hurting the 'little people' the lack of a link between mr ferri and his victims has made it all the harder for family , friends and colleagues of those who were shot to make sense of the violence it is , they say , like trying to draw moral lessons out of an event that was as random and impersonal as a natural disaster the people mr ferri gunned down may have worked in a highrise office in the city s financial district , but they were little people doing humble jobs , said charles ross , a lawyer who was among the six who were shot but survived mr ferri , a 55yearold mortgage broker and unlucky realestate speculator from los angeles , ended his 15minute rampage by raising a gun to his chin and killing himself this week , the funerals and memorials began , as did attempts to create some good from the grief at nearly every service , mourners are talking about stricter laws to control the semiautomatic pistols mr ferri legally bought before using them to kill on talk radio shows , callers discuss the falling down syndrome , a term taken from the title of a recent movie to describe middleaged men who crack under financial and emotional pressure and harvey saferstein , president of the california bar association , has called for an end to lawyer bashing , which he said contributed to mr ferri s rage no connection with firm a rambling letter found in mr ferri s bag and released over the weekend by the police makes clear that the man saw himself as a victim of a system out to crush him among others , he blamed the law firm pettit martin , which had given mr ferri advice in several real estate transactions in 1981 among the first victims of mr ferri s paranoid rage were four people in a glass conference room of the pettit martin offices on the 34th floor the firm had occasionally represented one of the parties and had lent the room for a deposition , although no one with the firm was in the room mr berman , 35 , sat with ms sposato , 30 , who was filing a sexdiscrimination suit against her former employer , electronic data systems , over her dismissal several years ago deanna eaves , 33 , a stenographer , took notes as sharon o'roke , 35 , a texas lawyer for eds , took ms sposato s deposition the deposition was to have taken only a day , but it spilled over for a second , putting them in harm s way the gunman fired through the conference room s glass window , killing mr berman and ms sposato on the spot ms eaves hid under the table , and ms o'roke ran for her life , while being shot five times ms eaves , who was shot in the arm , was released from the hospital today , and ms o'roke is still in the hospital in serious condition dying for his wife down the hall , john c scully , 28 , an associate with the firm , heard the shooting and ran down a staircase to an empty office on the 33d floor where he had left his 27yearold wife , michelle scully a lawyer at another firm , ms scully had come to her husband s office to use the law library and study privately , friends said they ran toward the elevator to escape but were confronted by the gunman as mr ferri aimed , ms scully later told the san francisco examiner , her husband thrust himself in front of her and was fatally wounded ms scully , shot in the arm , was released from the hospital over the weekend on the same floor , it had become a habit for david sutcliffe , a 30yearold summer intern from the university of colorado law school , to break the monotony of work in the early afternoon and visit charles ross in his office the intern liked to ask the 42yearold lawyer , who was working for the firm as an independent contractor , for advice ranging from how to maintain integrity as a lawyer to what sights he should visit in california that afternoon , mr sutcliffe was excited about having met the california attorney general , daniel e lungren , at a luncheon with pettit martin he seemed a little star struck , mr ross recalled fearing a 'pathetic death' moments after mr sutcliffe left his office , the gunman appeared in the doorway and shot mr ross in the arm i knew i was confronting a reality i could n't even imagine , said mr ross in an interview monday at his home , where he is recovering from his wound the gunman was cold , detached , impassive as if i could be anybody it made me realize that i had to be as coldblooded to him as he was to me he added , i was worried that i would die some pathetic death in the office mr ross slammed his door shut , only to have the gunman open it again then , yelling , who the hell are you \? mr ross said , he pushed past the gunman and ran down two corridors , ducking into a room to hide those not as fortunate as mr ross had , like him , never seen or heard of the gunman , the police said besides mr berman , ms sposato and mr scully , the dead were allen j berk , a partner with pettit martin deborah fogel , 33 , a secretary with the law firm davis wright tremaine donald michael merrill , 48 , who worked for trust company of the west as a financial consultant , and shirley mooser , 64 , an executive assistant at the trust company of the west brian berger , 39 , a pettit martin lawyer , remains in critical condition with massive chest injuries victoria smith , a marketing vice president for the trust company of the west , is in fair condition the hardest thing about the ordeal , mr ross said , was hearing that mr sutcliffe had been killed soon after leaving his office breaking down in tears , mr ross described the intern as a friendly kid who had a jimmy stewart sincerity that was rare i worked for what i got , mr ross said , haltingly i fought for my life but i have survivor s guilt photos at the entrance of a building in downtown san francisco , where a gunman killed eight people last thursday ,

richmond , feb 8 the virginia governor today abandoned a campaign to limit people to buying one handgun a month , but his new plan to allow additional gun purchases was immediately rebuffed by the state s house of delegates gov l douglas wilder this morning announced a proposal under which customers could buy an unlimited number of handguns after obtaining special permits from the state he said the new plan kept the spirit of the original the public will understand i would not sign on to something if i thought it was a loophole , the democratic governor said but this evening , the virginia house of delegates passed mr wilder s original proposal , 59 to 41 the senate will vote later in the week , and a state official said either version might eventually emerge from a conference committee the vote signaled that some type of gun control was virtually certain to pass before the legislature adjourns feb 27 , mr wilder said in a statement tonight mr wilder s onegunamonth idea has provoked a furious battle in the legislature since he announced it on jan 13 the plan came in response to figures from the federal bureau of alcohol , tobacco and firearms showing virginia as the leading source of guns traced from crimes in new york city and the washington area in new york in 1991 , 41 percent of such guns were found to have come from virginia in 1992 , the figure was 26 percent in washington , virginia was the origin of about twothirds of the seized guns would permit exceptions mr wilder s original , stronger plan had been supported by the democraticcontrolled house , and today s vote suggested opposition to the weakening of gun legislation but the governor s second plan would have permitted the sale of an unlimited number of guns to a person who a computer check showed did not have a criminal record and who filled out a virginia state police form giving a legitimate reason for the purchase exceptions to the original provision would include purchases of antique guns and firearms to be used in law enforcement or private security the plan announced today was a compromise with republican lawmakers mr wilder s original plan had run into stiff opposition in the senate , where republicans offered a proposal similar to the one the governor endorsed today currently , a gun buyer must show a virginia driver s license to a seller , who calls the state police for a computer check of criminal records if there is none , the sale is allowed tom hill , a spokesman for the bureau of alcohol , tobacco and firearms , said virginia was popular as a place to buy guns because no proof of residency was required to get a driver s license furthermore , in most of the state , outside the washington metropolitan area , no waiting period was required to buy a gun under the governor s new proposal , in a sale of a single gun , a computer check would show whether a customer had bought a handgun in the last 30 days if so , the customer would have to appear in person before a police official and obtain a purchase certificate in the case of a person wanting to buy several guns at one time , the customer would have to obtain the permit in person in advance
princeton aldous huxley was himself middleaged when he imagined an anthology of later works to be included , an artist had to have been a master who lived without ever ceasing to learn of life , and , in the novelist s view , not all masters had achieved this wordsworth , for example , spent his last 50 years preserving an almost unbroken record of dullness , and peter panlike , haydn continued to write the same sort of thing he had written 20 , 30 and 40 years before in fact , the only masters to make it into the hypothetical anthology were shakespeare , bach , el greco , beethoven , verdi and last but not least goya these thoughts appear in huxley s introduction to a volume of goya s etchings , printed \( poorly \) in 1947 reproduced in the book are los caprichos , los desastres de la guerra , la tauromaquia and los disparates to see all four series exhibited together is an unusual experience nevertheless , that is the treat now awaiting visitors to the art museum at princeton university the sleep of reason reality and fantasy in the print series of goya numbers 211 images made between 1796 and 1824 but , in the case of los desastres and los disparates , not published until some 40 years after the artist died a show organized and circulated by the trust for museum exhibitions , in washington , its contents were drawn from the collections at the claremont colleges , in claremont , calif the meadows museum of southern methodist university , in dallas , and in some instances from the princeton museum installations of old master prints tend to look alike at a distance , but this one proclaims its specialness from the start in the first gallery , where hang the relatively benign caprichos , the images in white mounts and stained wood frames contrast conventionally with the puttycolored walls but in the second gallery , the tones of mount and wall are so close that seemingly it is only the dark frames touched with gilt that keep the prints from escaping into space there could be no better foil for goya at his hallucinatory best , as he is in los disparates , or when ripping out the vitals of his fellow man , as he does in los desastres or , for that matter , when laying on the line the grisly everyday pleasures of bull fighting one might think that the blood sports would relieve some of the pressure , but of course one would be wrong goya is often regarded as a satirist , and to see how inappropriate that term is , the viewer has only to consider the other artists so called , like his english contemporary , thomas rowlandson , and daumier there are no laughs in this exhibition there is , however , a dreadful sense of the avidity , the almost prurient satisfaction felt by the artist as he contemplated the human capacity for monstrousness and nowhere is this more evident than in the war etchings , inspired by the napoleonic invasion of spain in 1808 yet , for all the images of atrocities committed by the french , it is pretty clear that the artist had humanity itself in mind and , considering the history of the last 200 years and the current reports from yugoslavia , who has the nerve to gainsay his pessimism \? los desastres abounds with ghastly images , none ghastlier than that of a hussar lounging before trees full of hanged corpses with the air of a man taking satisfaction in a job well done incidentally , the bearded , mustachioed face on this impeccably turnedout soldier is indistinguishable from the faces that caricaturists gave the german villains of world war i one of the artist s most effective devices is the composition that lurches sideways , as in he deserved it , where civilians are dragging off one of their own by the feet , and in the scene reproduced on this page , much the same , which features men heaping up bodies as if they were garbage but it is never better than in the tauromaquia print of the bull that has escaped into the stands , causing the spectators to rush forward in a mass what roland barthes would call the pique in a photograph is the corpse impaled on the horns of the motionless animal in the background the same panicstricken surge is in fearful folly , the disparates print of a giant shrouded figure that stands against a black sky towering over relative lilliputians los caprichos , though more an indictment of daytoday evil , is not without its hairraising images one is nanny s boy , a child with a mustache modeled , no doubt , on some overbred hapsburg and the nocturnal scene of a frightened young woman trying to extract teeth from the mouth of a hanged man \( for aphrodisiac purposes \) it is also the series containing the wellknown image of the artist bent over his desk , beset by owls and bats the sleep of reason produces monsters the show is an opportunity to renew acquaintance with the familiar and to encounter the unfamiliar , notably the painted miniature of a monk haranguing an old crone a very late work , this as important , though , it focuses attention on goya s technique his mastery of black , white and the speckled aquatint that huxley calls salt and pepper after leaving the university on april 11 , the prints continue on their nationwide tour the museum , in the middle of the campus , is open tuesday through saturday 10 am to 5 pm and sunday 1 to 5 pm photo much the same , by goya , is in an exhibition at the art museum at princeton university \( the art museum , princeton university \)

to the editor i think the new york times book review did a terrible disservice to its readers when it published the page 1 piece on holocaust denial \( july 11 \) , a branch of fiction promulgated by a few perverse european intellectuals and american pamphleteers , none of them credible or serious would you devote 4 , 000 words to an examination of the claims of the flat earth society \? the new york times leads , whether it wants to or not and this piece , by its appearance in your pages , gives respectability to an argument that deserves none ward just vineyard haven , mass
to the editor among my friends , and increasingly for me , a concern has been growing that the new york times has in some sense sold out to whom \? i cannot say indeed , i have no idea but we have all become increasingly shocked and troubled by the flagrant editorializing on your front page and in particular by what seems to have developed into a get clinton obsession in your editorials and columns i suspect you have been receiving many complaints about this , but to date i have seen none in print for great numbers of us , your paper has been for decades the standard by which others were measured \( and usually found flawed \) so it has been slowly and with pain that i , that we , have allowed ourselves to perceive and to detect and finally to remark on the painful and persistent slant , in splaying all over the front page whatever nasty item \( haircuts \? ! \) was available to you that day we are deeply disappointed that you are engaging in this kind of journalism fay horton sawyier chicago , june 2 , 1993
to the editor in response to your report on the new military government in nigeria \( news article , dec 2 \) a major objective of the nigerian state is to develop stable and lasting democratic structures the country has gone through problems and difficulties necessitating several military interventions but at no time did we give up the pursuit of the democratic objective none of the military governments intended to remain in power indefinitely all saw themselves as corrective regimes determined to restore peace and stability , and to chart a new course for political and economic development , based on democracy and free enterprise thus , although most nigerians prefer democratic rule , they almost invariably welcome military interventions , which they see as better than allowing the country to slide into chaos , with unpredictable consequences the military , for its part , rules in full consultations with the general public , by nationwide debates and setting up elected institutions to chart a new political future in addition , the military runs the country in cooperation with civilians in the present military government led by gen sani abacha , all but two members of the 33man cabinet are accomplished and experienced politicians and administrators , contrary to your quoted allegation that they are all brawn , no brains by deciding to include in his government prodemocracy activists and to call for a constitutional conference , general abacha has demonstrated he does not intend to stay in power indefinitely moreover , all nigerian military governments respect human rights and due process it is true that some people are detained from time to time , but only if they are involved in criminal offenses , such as organizing riots , in which many innocent people lose their lives or property but even such criminals are released after some time nigerian military regimes have never deliberately engaged in brutalities , largescale repression and murder of political opponents freedom of speech and expression is always allowed like many other countries , nigeria is encountering serious economic problems in our case , these are accentuated by our economic recovery program but the standard of living of our people has risen considerably since independence , with the provision of electricity , pipeborne water , hospitals and secondary schools in the rural areas during the military regimes that we had in the 1970 s and 80 s zubair mahmud kazaure ambassador of nigeria washington , dec 6 , 1993

peter jampolis \( with striking sets by dale chihuly \) , just a week after having seen strauss s ariadne auf naxos , in elijah moshinsky s beautiful though slightly busy new production at the metropolitan opera the juxtaposition revealed reasons for strauss s bafflement both pelleas and ariadne were composed early in the century and heavily influenced by wagner , and each deals with a mythic subject and rejects realism yet they occupy different musical universes , representing opposite poles of the modernist movement ariadne is a deliberate composite of allusions to opera s past the prologue shows an opera composer and cast preparing for a performance of a new opera seria , only to learn that the rich viennese patron has hired a commedia dell'arte troupe to perform at the same time the music derives much of its strength from its miscellaneous styles , which shift as quickly as the farcical goingson and include mockrossini , hints of viennese coffeehouse tunes , standard operatic melodrama when the composer sings of the mystery of life , the music turns to ersatz wagner , as if to rib the composer s piety the score s musical masks , with their winks to the audience , are stripped away when zerbinetta , the coquettish commedia interloper , sings ein augenblick and when the composer hails music as a holy art in these moments of great sincerity , the music is completely straussian zerbinetta observes that no one can know what is real on a stage she may appear joyful but really be sad the composer defends his belief in music s powers both are preoccupied with art s illusion for one , even when playful , art causes delusion for the other , in the form of opera , it is revelation the listener is caught between these two views the opposition is never resolved the same thing happens during the work s second half , when the composer s ariadne is performed even apart from the commedia interruptions , the operawithinanopera presents a peculiarly divided pair of lovers ariadne is submerged in a world of illusion , believing bacchus to be the god of death bacchus dwells on his escape from circe s sorcery , worrying that ariadne might have similar magical power bacchus and ariadne , with their jarringly mismatched fantasy lives , are as different as zerbinetta and the composer , yet strauss treats their meeting as if they were partaking in a heroic romance the glorious music makes it seem as if siegfried were rescuing brunnhilde , or tristan and isolde were finally uniting meanwhile , hugo von hofmannsthal s libretto makes their love antiheroic , overturning traditions and expectations the audience is both moved by events and distanced from them , reminded of the past while leaving it behind pelleas is another matter debussy also wanted to depart from operatic tradition he once joked about producing the work in japan , where there would be no set expectations or interpretive habits but he does not separate the work from the past by using irony or pastiche or sly reference he tries to dissolve time completely although pelleas resembles parsifal in this respect , debussy eliminates wagner s drive toward resolution and fulfillment the score uses a motif for each major character and even combines them but these motifs are not used to italicize events they seem to float in a musical stream , carried by its currents maurice maeterlinck s play , which forms the basis of the libretto , acts similarly the characters have no background in time and seem suspended in their mythic kingdom melisande has a mysterious past that is never known pelleas is always about to leave but never does six months pass as easily as a minute debussy treats this world of caverns and stagnant pools and deep wells the way he treats the sunken cathedral in his piano prelude it has its own watery pulse when golaud brings pelleas into the castle vaults , repetitions of a wholetone scale create an eerie morbidity debussy s music actually tries to eliminate all sense of difference and division it cushions the listener , even dissolving distinctions between sung and spoken language \( debussy wanted his singers to emulate speech \) boundaries between the real and the unreal become porous in contrast , strauss s music thrives on differences and divisions , on operatic numbers and set pieces , on contrasting styles and sudden juxtapositions debussy dissolves history into dream language strauss turns history into a burlesque no wonder strauss could n't hear anything in pelleas he was eavesdropping on a parallel universe similar goals , opposite ideas we dwell somewhere in between perhaps someone should consider performing pelleas and ariadne simultaneously
milan , italy , nov 16 listen carefully the sound you do not hear is a nation holding its breath there are no banners , no horns , no crowds parading through the street , but there is an advanced case of communal anxiety here in italy as its national soccer team faces wednesday s final qualifying game for the world cup of 1994 from the arid boot of italy to the damp northern cities , few people do not know the score if italy beats or ties portugal wednesday night , italy goes to the world s most important tournament , to be held at nine sites in the united states next june if the country with the best professional league in the world loses to portugal , the only way it can sneak in is for switzerland to lose to weak estonia if italy does not qualify , it will be a civic disgrace careers will be altered , heads will roll evaluating the italian mix meanwhile , in the host nation , millions of soccer fans are well aware that italy would supply the single greatest mixture of tradition , skill , money and positive energy alan rothenberg , the president of the united states soccer federation , must take the official posture of any parent that he loves all his children equally but it just happens that rothenberg has chosen to attend wednesday s game in milan in terms of excitement , pageantry , there are half a dozen teams that are special , rothenberg said the other day in terms of tickets , it does n't mean much because we 're doing so well but in terms of other business , obviously , it means a lot of money and italy is almost like a second homeland for so many americans italy is one of 16 countries still fighting for the last nine spots in the 24team tournament after a grueling twoyear process the most clearcut games wednesday are in buenos aires and paris australia plays at argentina after the two teams tied , 11 , in the first match of a twogame totalgoals series bulgaria travels to france , which needs only a tie but in four other groups , teams must play their own games and wonder what is happening in simultaneous games the top two teams in each group qualify denmark needs a tie in group 3 , ireland plays northern ireland at belfast , following a recent wave of violence , and will qualify with a victory at the same time , denmark plays spain at seville , with denmark holding a 1point lead over spain and ireland denmark needs only a tie to qualify the situation is more complicated in group 4 , where belgium has 14 points , romania 13 and wales and the former czechoslovakia have 12 each romania plays wales at cardiff the czech and slovak states play belgium at brussels ties are decided by goal differential in group 2 , england would have to wipe out a goal differential of 7 by rolling over san marino in bologna , italy , and hope the netherlands would lose mightily to mediocre poland in poznan the turnaround seems virtually impossible in worldlevel soccer in group 1 , italy has scored more goals than portugal , which is why italy will qualify with a tie switzerland , 1 point behind , will qualify if it beats weak estonia at zurich unless portugal and italy arrive at a tie with three goals or more soccer , italianstyle world cup officials know portugal would bring its own loyal following to the site at the meadowlands in new jersey or the one in foxboro , mass , but there is only one italy it has the most expensive league , its sunday league games are televised live to favored cities like new york and boston , and it has won three world cups plus , there are the italianamericans studies show three million americans of italian descent living within a 50mile radius , said charlie stillitano , the director of the new jersey venue that s very significant because as a venue director , i want the most passion possible anybody who has been to a world cup has been touched by fans from two dozen nations , in costumes , waving flags , blaring horns there was none of that in sober milan , where people were going about business today rather than staging pep rallies at futuristic san siro stadium , there were no fans , except for a few friendly gents offering to sell a ticket for about 240 in the ubiquitous shops of milan , you could buy a michael jordan cap easier than a souvenir of the azzurri , the blues , the national team sometimes , emotions run wild people get more excited about the league teams , said enzo degl'innocenti , a young cab driver but they will get excited if italy wins the world cup that gigantic sense of entitlement can be uncomfortable when there is failure the italian players of 1970 remember being spat upon after flying home from their world cup loss in mexico this year italy would be among the five favorites but first it must qualify italy beat portugal , 31 , in oporto on feb 24 , but italy s players are frequently injured or out of favor national coach arrigo sacchi , who never played major soccer but won a league title with milan , recently called up his 64th different player in two years sacchi is starting four milan players , but counts heavily upon elegant roberto baggio from juventus of turin , who set up all three goals recently against scotland there is great fear and trembling that the reliance on highlypaid foreigners \( stranieri \) in league play limits the scoring skills of italians no , risk , no gain when will you ever have millions of people watching you \? sacchi asked , trying to turn the national angst into a positive i say that when you do n't want to risk stress , then it s time to get out the nation is going through corruption scandals in business and politics , and reaching the world cup would do wonders for the italian psyche it would do wonders for the american organizers , too photo italian national team players

washington , may 5 the federal reserve said today that there was generally modest improvement in the economy in april after the stormrelated slowdown in much of the country in march in its survey of economic conditions , known as the beige book , the central bank said shopper traffic and retail sales were reported to have rebounded modestly last month the report was more upbeat than some of the government s recent statistics but many economists consider the beige book to be less reliable than the government s statistical reports because it is based on informal surveys and impressions shortterm interest rates the beige book was prepared for use at a meeting on may 18 of the federal open market committee , the central bank s main policymaking committee the group will determine shortterm interest rates over the next six weeks , and most economists expect it to leave rates unchanged the group meets every six weeks the report said that in most of the country , manufacturers reported increased shipments and orders , with production in some automotive and steel plants near capacity according to the survey of the nation s 12 federal reserve districts , residential real estate activity is strong or on the rise in most regions around the nation , although the southern california market remains in a slump the federal reserve said there was a general increase in bank lending , noting that it was concentrated in consumer loans and home mortgage refinancings , rather than in business loans in several areas of the midwest , however , there was a noticeable pickup in lending to small business problems in california in the west , the survey said , the greatest economic problems were in california , where aerospace and military cutbacks have hurt consumer confidence and economic activity , and western washington , with the strongest growth in utah , idaho and eastern washington job conditions were mixed in most regions , the report said it noted that some companies are hiring modestly , particularly in auto parts and capital equipment but none of the 12 federal reserve districts anticipated a flurry of new hiring , and several districts said employers were avoiding new hiring by extending hours , using temporary workers and increasing productivity the report saw little in the way of inflationary pressures , a result of stiff competition , slower sales growth and consumer resistance to price increases the federal reserve bank of san francisco said lumber companies reported a 20 percent drop in lumber and plywood prices from their peak in march according to the report , many retailers said consumer confidence was lower than at the beginning of the year a large midwest retailer surveyed said sales growth was held back by bad weather , concerns about tax increases and uncertainty about the impact of changes in income tax withholding steel production is doing especially well , the report said , because of increased sales of motor vehicles and consumer appliances new york area is mixed in the new york area , economic developments were mixed in recent weeks , but on balance tended toward improvement , the survey said many retailers said their sales were below projections during february and march , partly because of severe snowstorms , although some were able to make up the shortfall in late march home builders in the region reported some recent improvement and predicted that home sales would surpass last year s level the report noted that declining vacancy rates and other factors were prompting some prominent developers to plan new rental apartment buildings for the first time in years the report said that no one was anticipating a building boom , however , because of worries about job security and changes in federal taxes according to the report , leasing activity was brisk in midtown manhattan , with the vacancy rate edging downward
the investment house owned by gov jim florio s chief aide and another florio political associate earned more than one million dollars in three years even though the firm performed little underwriting work , and in some cases none at all , for the money , according to wall street executives , lawyers and government officials who did business with it the firm , armacon securities , was federally licensed to buy new bond issues and to resell them to the public , but it lacked almost all of the normal essentials of an underwriter nevertheless , some wall street firms , and some issuers of bonds , said they were happy to bring the small new jersey firm into underwriting deals because of the perceived influence of its founders and their related enterprise , consolidated financial management , in state finance and politics they said it was neither illegal nor improper , but simply how wall street works the two firms won their reputation through the work of their principal investors , joseph c salema , who became governor florio s chief of staff in 1990 , and his associate , nicholas a rudi jr , a former camden county administrator consolidated financial specialized in advising local governments in their sale of municipal bonds armacon had no sales staff to sell the bonds , no clientele of retail customers to buy them and little capital of its own to finance an inventory in 1991 , when it took in 727 , 800 in underwriting fees , its total operating expenses were less than 50 , 000 as an underwriter , armacon s profile was so low that some investment houses involved in underwriting groups did not even know armacon was taking part did we do a deal with them \? asked the head of public finance for an investment bank that was one of the underwriters in a 1992 bond offering by the hudson county improvement authority , a deal in which armacon participated i never heard of them before at least 10 other investment bankers , bond lawyers or bond traders who took part in bond sales that officially included armacon among the underwriters expressed similar puzzlement normally firms are entirely aware of who else is involved in the cooperative selling effort mr salema has maintained that he had no knowledge or control of armacon s business dealings after he rejoined mr florio s staff in 1990 , shortly after the firm was founded through a representative , mr rudi declined to discuss consolidated s or armacon s operations 'goodwill payments' in spite of its limited scope , armacon has profited from at least 14 underwritings people working with the firm acknowledged that on occasion wall street investment houses had brought it into underwriting deals to provide goodwill payments to the firm the investment houses hoped that sooner or later armacon or consolidated could prove helpful by steering business toward them or putting in a good word with a client at the right time some investment bankers and lawyers on wall street described these practices as a way of life investment banking houses typically rely on a web of relationships built up over years , often on a bed of mutual favors while some favors may be illegal , wall street executives and lawyers said they believed that splitting fees with small regional firms with good local ties was both legal and good business even if the recipient did little work , or none , on a given deal it s the nature of the business that you can very often get paid for doing nothing , one person who has worked with armacon said like most other wall street sources , he spoke only on condition of anonymity , for fear of jeopardizing business relationships armacon and its affiliate , consolidated financial management , both in clementon , are under investigation by federal officials looking into whether merrill lynch company made improper payments to armacon to obtain state bond business at least one other firm , the first boston corporation , has been subpoenaed for records in the inquiry , executives with the firm said three inquiries wall street s dealings with armacon and consolidated are being examined in separate criminal and civil inquiries run by the united states attorney in manhattan and by the securities and exchange commission the national association of securities dealers , an industry selfregulatory body that oversees the overthecounter market , has also begun an inquiry , according to wall street executives who have been asked for information by the nasd merrill lynch , mr salema and mr rudi have repeatedly maintained that they are not targets of the federal inquiry , although merrill lynch has suspended three senior municipal bond executives who had dealings with armacon in 1991 , the year it began assisting in bond underwriting , armacon earned 616 , 358 , according to its sec filings in that year , the firm was involved in three underwritings subsequent sec filings that are publicly available do not disclose the firm s earnings , but it has been involved in at least 11 deals since then , and its 1992 tax liability more than doubled the previous year s a person with ties to the firm said its total profits easily exceeded one million dollars
chicago the press had it backward , michael jordan said more than once he was not retiring from basketball because his father had died he was retiring from basketball because his father had lived the father was considerably shorter , and just as bald , and he always fell short of being a caricature of a stage parent just when you thought james jordan might be hanging around a bit too much , you realized he was n't waiting in the corridors because he liked it although he surely did he was also there because his son wanted him to be there he was his son s best friend that night last spring in the limousine speeding from new york to atlantic city , father and son getting away from the brutal pressure of the arena , surely they talked more than cards and jump shots his father had such a profound impact on him that michael jordan remembered a conversation they had in the summer of 1991 , after the chicago bulls had won their first title retire , the father had said or at least , that was how michael jordan remembered it yesterday on the day he actually did retire he heard his father s voice saying he did n't need basketball anymore the father clarified it for the son , the way parents can do , if the children are wise enough to listen , which is not always the case james jordan was shot to death while napping in his car in july , but he had given his son a great gift before he died he gave him the liberty to be his own man the son took that advice yesterday he gave up the game he loved but did n't need all that much some of us who fretted about the compulsions of michael jordan now have to face the possibility that this man actually does know the limits if there was a tear shed , i could not see it michael jordan was as purposeful in his retirement announcement as he was on the court and in the process , he paid tribute to the man who was blown away on a dark north carolina highway two months ago that really made me realize how short life can be , jordan said yesterday in his deep , clear voice it can be taken away so quickly , so innocently i'm an optimistic person and i try to take something from it that made my decision even simpler he did n't go around thinking he carried the weight of the world , of chicagoland , of the jordan family , of black america , of the national basketball association something had given him the insight that he could act for himself after the bulls won their third straight title , giving him something that even magic johnson and even larry bird had never done , michael jordan had some quiet times with his father not much time , because these were two grown men , hurtling around to golf games and funerals and business deals and whatever else they did and then they were separated by random evil jordan said he took time to mourn , and then discovered that nothing had changed a lot of my life has been very selfish , jordan said yesterday it s time to be unselfish i 've got to get back to a more normal life , as normal as possible for all the money and the glory , his life has seemed dreadful recent books by sam smith and bob greene , journalists in this town , have made him seem a captive of overheated hotel rooms and room service and back stairways and latenight card games with old cronies , partly because he could not go out and wander the malls or take in a movie so he made his break for relative freedom he went to phil jackson , the coach with his equally deep roots in christianity and the 1960 s counterculture jordan has not always agreed with jackson s coaching , but he respects the man inside i asked phil , 'is there anything more for me to prove \? ' jordan recalled phil thought for a minute , and i realized there was n't jerry reinsdorf , the club owner , did not try to dissuade him , either it would have been very dishonest , reinsdorf said yesterday , michael jordan talked about the future , being with his wife and children , playing golf for fun and challenge , playing basketball informally he was so realistic , so much at peace with himself , that he even conceded he might feel the urge to play , sometime down the road the word 'retire' means you can do anything you want , jordan said i'm not going to close the door on it perhaps this retirement will turn out to be a sabbatical , in honor of his father the biggest thing i can take from my father not being here today is that he saw my last game , michael jordan said that meant a lot and if he ever plays again , it will be for himself michael jordan was not playing any games yesterday , none at all photo james jordan \( associated press \)
chicago lean and fit , stephen m wolf , the 52yearold chairman of united airlines , works out every chance he gets in the personal gym adjoining his office here and he s attacking the problem of getting the carrier into fighting trim with an equal zeal united became the nation s largest airline in june , edging out american by the crucial measure of miles flown by passengers but far from celebrating , mr wolf is looking critically at what industry analysts agree is an unhealthy amount of fat indeed , united s parent , ual corporation , posted an operating loss of 538 million last year , far more than amr , american s parent , which posted a 25 million operating loss particularly worrisome , southwest airlines , the only major carrier to report a profit last year , is competing on an increasing portion of united s routes 16 percent , double the 8 percent overlap of only five years ago and mr wolf realizes that united has to match southwest s lowcost structure if it is to remain competitive the most dramatic result of mr wolf s efforts is the possible buyout of the airline by its unions responding to his appeal for help last month , the pilots , machinists and flight attendants'unions politely indicated a willingness to make concessions in return for a controlling stake in ual the development is remarkable for several reasons while unions have traded concessions for equity at trans world airlines and northwest airlines , they did so only with their backs against a wall united , by contrast , has a 19 billion cash cushion moreover , three previous attempts by united s unions to buy the carrier not only failed , but were marked by confrontation and invective now union leaders who largely balked at mr wolf s invitation earlier this year to discuss concessions have adopted his earnest , conciliatory stance of trying to find a way to assure the carrier s longterm viability and secure workers' jobs we seek to pursue a collaborative effort now with a still healthy company , the unions said labor leaders have shared few thoughts lately about the move , but they clearly were swayed by unpalatable alternatives and an industrywide contraction that has helped make united the latest example of bedrock american companies trying to orchestrate a shift to a lithe , more profitable structure united also reflects how transportation companies are scrambling to cope in a deregulated market of lowercost airlines pressuring the largest carriers mr wolf is not relying on just one strategy to restore united to health united is shedding moneylosing routes , just recently cutting its daily departures from orlando by more than half united has also established a new subsidiary , the ual leasing corporation , to lease the planes it is otherwise grounding air wisconsin , a small fleet that feeds passengers to united hubs , has been sold united has also replaced cleaning staff and skycaps with contract workers it is reviewing bids to buy its 17 flight kitchens , which employ 5 , 800 workers and has raised the possibility of selling its pilot training center in denver all these changes are on top of the 400 million united carved out of its 1993 operating budget the most controversial suggestion so far , however , is that united might spin off an airline with nonunion pilots to take over unprofitable shorthaul routes united s top managers have deployed a vice president , frederic f jake brace , to study the issue fulltime , and they continually comment on the importance of the socalled jake brace project as the big fix for their domestic operations there is one issue standing between us and glory , said john c pope , united s president and chief operating officer but the pilots reacted sharply in june when the possibility of a spunoff carrier came to light , reminding the airline that such a breach of faith prompted a strike in 1985 , and that we will again respond with every legal means at our disposal that made the unions' friendly response last month all the more surprising industry analysts credit , to some degree , mr wolf s highminded stump speeches about the need for change over the last several months he has campaigned to convince employees that the industry faces deeprooted problems the unions recognized many years ago the need for restructuring , but to his credit , wolf has succeeded in persuading them that management s view of the airlines is sincere and accurate , said joseph r blasi , professor of management and labor relations at rutgers university , who has been retained by united s nonunion employees to advise them as the buyout talks progress it was mr wolf who first floated the notion in washington that a national commission should be appointed to study the industry s ailments in speeches , interviews and internal employee newsletters , mr wolf and his lieutenants tell and retell a lesson in airline economics 101 about secular changes under way in the business in his monthly editorial in the july issue of united s inflight magazine , mr wolf addressed the importance of increasing productivity of american workers , a message no doubt written with united s unions in mind as they consider the airline s restructuring plan
banking officials testifying in the world trade center bombing trial yesterday traced transactions involving several defendants in the case , drawing a picture of joint accounts opened with cash , withdrawn as cash and sometimes transferred to other accounts as cash the manager of a jersey city branch of statewide savings bank , diane lynch , said that one of the defendants , mohammed a salameh , deposited 8 , 570 on oct 22 , 1992 , four months before the trade center explosion that killed six people and injured more than a thousand ms lynch said that mr salameh withdrew 3 , 400 in onehundred dollar bills on nov 30 another banking executive , steven torry , assistant branch manager of a national westminister bank in jersey city , testified that mr salameh and another defendant , nidal a ayyad , opened a joint account and deposited 8 , 567 on oct 14 , 1992 , withdrawing 8 , 560 eight days later prosecutors did not explain the significance of the transactions , but the indictment indicates that they will show that the money was used to buy chemicals to make the trade center bomb they are also expected to argue that the transfers from one bank to the next were intended to hide the trail of the funds source of money is unclear it was the first time that the prosecution has introduced testimony regarding the money that it says was used to finance the trade center operation where the money came from has not been made clear and may never be the testimony also indicated that mr salameh maintained a joint account and a safedeposit box with a fifth defendant in the case , bilal alkaisi , who will be tried separately mr ayyad was listed as also having access to the safedeposit box attempting to take the sting out of the government s evidence , mr salameh s defense lawyer , robert e precht , had ms lynch acknowledge that arab immigrants commonly open accounts with cash and engage in cash transactions the defense suggestion is that the mere existence of the defendants' joint accounts does not implicate them in wrongdoing testimony about the money transfers came at the end of a day taken up mostly by the 12 jurors and 5 alternates leafing through hundreds of pamphlets , books and magazines in several languages , all from the luggage of another defendant , ahmad m ajaj for most of the morning session , while the rest of the court dozed or stared into space , the jury perused a small river of publications handed them by mr ajaj s defense lawyer in addition to many bound publications , there were stacks of postcards , envelopes , folders and plastic evidence bags filled with scraps of paper of varied sizes , all of it found in the three pieces of luggage that mr ajaj had with him when he arrived at kennedy international airport from peshawar , pakistan , on sept 1 last year many types of literature there were copies of the economist some american newsmagazines a copy of the daily newspaper of peshawar a blue express shipping service envelope , and what appeared from a distance to be electronics catalogues and softbound books with gold embossed lettering on them and red designs they were in english , arabic , urdu and even swedish , and they demonstrated that if nothing else , mr ajaj collected all sorts of literature earlier in the trial , it had been established that mr ajaj , a palestinian living in houston , went to peshawar in april 1992 the prosecution s contention is that mr ajaj became involved in the trade center conspiracy during his trip abroad when he returned to the united states five months later , he was traveling under a false name using a fake passport and was carrying in his luggage six volumes of military manuals that included instructions on how to build homemade bombs the prosecution is expected to present testimony eventually that on the volumes in mr ajaj s possession were the fingerprints of a man , ramzi ahmed yousef , who is accused in the indictment of helping to build the bomb but mr ajaj s lawyer , austin v campriello , is trying , it seems , to suggest in the jury s mind a different ahmad ajaj from the radical palestinian terrorist portrayed by the prosecution hence mr campriello s decision to circulate to the jurors every page and every scrap of paper in mr ajaj s possession , apparently to show them that the defendant had many other books and magazines , none with any evident connection to bombmaking
the war between coffee shops and their patrons is centuries old , at least new yorkers know that while you do n't exactly take your life in your hands whenever you enter a coffee shop here , you certainly risk your nerves being rattled and your ego bludgeoned and your coffee served weak i have been a devoted soldier on this battleground for much of my adult life and so speak with consummate authority on survival techniques in coffee shops i have navigated the mine fields of service , food , tips and stained silverware to get to the souvlaki , the mousaka and the chicken gyro deluxe as well as , in delicatessens , the belly lox , the kasha knish and the nutandraisin rugelach i have had the succulent , i have had the soggy when asked , i am not shy about imparting my acquired wisdom in these matters i include delicatessens in this conflict since the prices , the atmosphere and the attitudes are often similar , and sometimes even the food overlaps most of the town s coffee shops i 've eaten in are owned by greeks , and most of the delis are run by jews in the historically jewish and greek new york restaurants , you must always be prepared to defend yourself , either from a waiter spilling feta cheese in your lap or from a zinging wisecrack i once asked a waiter , how s your corned beef today \? he said , fine , how s yours \? the late sportswriter jimmy cannon and a group of colleagues were in a hurry one day but stopped in a coffee shop for a quick bite cannon gave the waitress careful and specific instructions on how he wanted his club sandwich i want two pieces of bread , not three i'm on a diet when the order arrived , he counted the pieces of bread with his finger there were three pieces he looked up god gets even with me in little ways , he said he meant waiters or waitresses get even , i believe , because they are on a different level from the deities i remember a line somewhere about a waiter even god could n't catch his eye sometimes even waving your hand or your knife wo n't work you must wait until they are finished looking over their fingernails one waitress in a coffee shop in recent memory had all the charm and grace of a prisoncamp guard i ordered a bowl of raisin bran she said they had none i was puzzled because when i entered the establishment i was sure i had seen raisin bran on a shelf with other small boxes of cereals i walked to the front there it was ! i returned to my seat , called her over and told her she returned with a bowl and the box of raisin bran unopened , of course why did you tell me you did n't have raisin bran \? i asked i lied , she said , with a strange smile after i had eaten my raisin bran and was departing , i stopped beside her i left you a nice tip on the table , i said our eyes met thanks , she said i lied , i said now , this was uncharacteristic of me because i usually leave a tip no matter how deplorable the service the reason is , these are people working hard for a living , normally , and i respect that i also know that if you 're going to return to a coffee shop , you 'd better be on good terms with the person who serves you you never know what little tricks they may play on you and your order but if you are ever to nail one of them , you must be prepared never to darken that particular joint s door again , as i was or at least until the server quits to work in another coffee shop , which happens frequently i have been with some masters of the coffee shop and deli , people who have served in the trenches , so to speak , and understand the power of blandishments and a broad world view i was with the great former knick basketball coach , red holzman , when , leaning toward the waiter , he said almost conspiratorially , is your soup hot today \? the waiter assured him it was red indeed got his hot bowl of soup , since the waiter , disarmed by red s question , made a special effort for him in the kitchen gave him some extra cole slaw , too another time i sat with the comedian jackie mason and a companion of his in a deli jackie s friend ordered a sliced tongue platter , and when it came it looked as if it could feed an army my god , said the companion , so much food ! i ca n't eat all that food ! mason was taken aback who says you have to eat all the food \? he said if you go into a house and see a room filled with chairs , you do n't say , 'too many chairs , i ca n't sit down ! ' i once interviewed julia child , the french chef , and asked how she selected a restaurant when traveling she mentioned three main criteria i check to see if there are fresh flowers on the table , if there are clean tableclothes and if there is the smell of good butter cooking my rules for choosing coffee shops and delis are not quite the same i want something hardy , something livedin , something that shows there has been some pretty good eating activity there lately i avoid a place with fresh flowers too genteel plastic flowers if any flowers tell me that management is more concerned with flanken than flora i want a place with a few crumbs on the table and chair someone has apparently enjoyed something there recently and the smell i want is either that of corned beef or corn muffins anything else is just commentary drawing
rangers forward aleksei kovalev must serve a fivegame suspension for tripping dale hunter of washington in a game last sunday night , the national hockey league announced yesterday the penalty , handed down by the nhl s senior vice president , brian burke , matches the longest suspension given by the league this season and will cost kovalev 27 , 34375 , his salary for five games burke said yesterday that kovalev s action in itself may not have been enough to warrant such a severe penalty , but that kovalev s record of onice misbehavior this season had prompted him to send the young russian forward a message the seriousness of the injury hunter will miss four to six weeks with a torn anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee also played a part in burke s decision you ca n't say it was a slash , and it was n't a combative act , burke acknowledged but it was sneaky it was senseless he was n't going for a puck he was n't trying to prevent a scoring chance it was senseless a simple response in the sunday game , which was played at madison square garden , kovalev approached hunter from behind the capitals' net and used his skate to kick hunter s skates out from underneath him no penalty was called on the play in his hearing before burke on wednesday , kovalev stressed that the incident was an accident , and thus did not warrant punishment burke said his response to that was simple alex , he said , you 've had three 'accidents' this year the first came when kovalev , who is in his second season in the league , hit a capital from behind in the rangers' game against washington on oct 11 for that infraction , he received a formal warning from the league a month later , kovalev was suspended from the rangers' game against winnipeg on nov 10 after incurring backtoback major highsticking penalties in new york s two previous games for these and other incidents , kovalev is gaining a reputation in the league for being something of a cheapshot artist when gary bettman took over the league , burke said , referring to the nhl commissioner , he said that repeat offenders were going to be penalized significantly that was a factor here kovalev is not a novice in the justice system in the national hockey league and i'm concerned i'm concerned because he s got great physical ability , great talent but he 'd better make an adjustment in how he plays or he is going to be inactive a great deal in the future hunter an angel \? not ! neil smith , the rangers' president and general manager , reacted with frustration to yesterday s ruling , saying that based on the videotape of sunday s game , kovalev did not deserve to be penalized at all and rangers coach mike keenan was quick to note that hunter was hardly an angel , having recently finished serving a 21game suspension for slamming a celebrating pierre turgeon into the boards during last spring s playoffs if you live by the sword , eventually you 're going to die by the sword keenan said of hunter it s unfortunate that he was hurt , but that s the way he s always played the game of hockey he s hurt a lot of people and maybe it all caught up to him there is bad blood between kovalev and hunter kovalev broke the hand of mark hunter , dale s brother , in a minor league game last season and dale hunter had suggested that he would attempt to retaliate but burke insisted yesterday that none of that played a part in determining kovalev s intent in the tripping incident i'm ignorant of those facts , burke said and they were not brought to my attention during the hearing kovalev served the first game of his suspension on tuesday , when he was forced to sit out the rangers' 31 victory over the new jersey devils pending his hearing yesterday with burke he will also miss games against toronto tomorrow , new jersey on sunday , edmonton on wednesday and buffalo on dec 13 he will be eligible to return to the lineup on dec 15 , when the rangers play the hartford whalers at the garden in addition to forfeiting his salary for those games , kovalev was fined 500 by the league i feel the game is being decided on a video screen , kovalev said no penalty was called on me during the game , yet i'm being suspended two other nhl players have received fivegame suspensions this season hartford s doug houda was suspended for that many games after headbutting buffalo s randy mohler , and rangers forward nick kypreos sat out five games after his check on james black of dallas resulted in 29 stitches in black s forehead that incident occurred while kypreos was still playing for the whalers
tai n't necessarily so , i know , but i have always subscribed to the theory that more is better more pudding , more parties longer , lower , wider you 'd think i was born in texas instead of pennsylvania but in one regard , at least , bigger is indeed better , and that has to do with the chrysler corporation s two latest cars the stretched versions of the lh series introduced last fall , the chrysler concorde , the dodge intrepid and the eagle vision the new ones are called new yorker \( base price 24 , 294 \) and lhs \( 29 , 105 \) , and they are seven inches longer than the midsized cabforward models that have occupied so much commercial time on television they are frontwheeldrive sedans , fast and vast , with huge trunks , and they are today s incarnation of the old detroit iron but immensely better there were two test cars , first the new yorker and then the lhs , and aside from badges and interiors and such , they were identical , both painted in what the company calls chargold the paint , a 97 option , was nice enough , but other colors would be less bland chargold looks tan or gray or gold , depending on the light , but none of those hues was as pretty as the silver that graced the car when it made its debut at the detroit auto show last year at that time , it was judged best in show by the visitors , and when the concept car came to the new york exposition just a bit later , it was the hit of the year if you exclude the spectacular dodge viper , a concept car that also went into production but it was n't just the color that caught everyone s fancy it was the design , and that makes sense , since the roofline is a direct steal from the classic past the rounded rear profile in particular is something we have seen before chrysler says it was lifted from the type 57 bugatti of the 1930 s that may be , although it seemed to me that it was really a replica of the saloons marketed by jaguar from 1953 through the 1960 s it could be that jaguar stole it from bugatti and that we never noticed or it could be that chrysler simply does n't want to admit to learning from jaguar , which now is owned by ford in any case , the lines are gorgeous , and the roof allows more headroom in a car that already is an amazing package , a modern automobile that offers as much interior space as the behemoth new yorker sedan of 1960 and while we are at it , it is worth mentioning that chrysler will continue to market its previous line of large cars the imperial , new yorker fifth avenue , salon and lebaron sedan until supplies run out production of those far more angular and dated models will end next month but those cars , along with the hotselling lh s , jeeps and minivans , have finally brought chrysler back to profitability , making it the only one of detroit s big 3 that made money last year in addition , this year s sales are up almost 25 percent the new yorker and lhs are expected to build on the success of the lh series , and they make standard their siblings' optional 35liter v6 with its 24 valves and 214 horsepower a fourspeed electronically controlled automatic is the only transmission available , but performance is as good as might be expected from a stick zeroto60 performance is on the order of eight seconds , mighty quick for a sedan , and fuel economy is rated at 18 , city , and 26 , highway in actual driving , consumption averaged 23 miles a gallon , but the cars were new , and a breakin period no doubt would improve the number fourwheel disk brakes are standard , as is an antilock system traction control is optional on the new yorker and standard on the lhs it eliminates wheel spin by engaging the brakes on a wheel that is losing traction like the '93 lh models , the 1994 new yorker and lhs use an automatic system to recirculate air when sensors detect that the interior is overwarm , even when the engine is off and the car is parked despite the common platform , the new models share no body panels with the lh cars , and there is a unique body crease that runs from front fender to taillight at the rear , the added length means a massive trunk , and the cars offer a fullsized spare beneath the cargo floor the trunklid is perhaps overly plain and might benefit from ornamentation but there is a low liftover and the taillights do not intrude into the opening inside , a black elastic cargo net spans the cavern to keep grocery bags from toppling a nice touch one problem with both test cars , though , involved the rounded corners of the rear bumper the trim is chrome tape , mounted in the soft plastic cover of the bumper , and each car s tape had been chewed by the walls of parking garages chrysler will have to do something about that with the added length , both cars offer limousinestyle comfort but there are differences , including these the new yorker i get letters now and again from people who wonder why the manufacturers do n't put the shift lever back on the steering column where it belongs in this case , chrysler has the car also had a bench seat in front , split 5050 , and the test car had what chrysler calls premium leather the bench is all that is available in the new yorker , and along with the column shift it does make that model a typical old american car

in november district attorney robert t johnson of the bronx announced what appeared to be a brash attack on the status quo no longer would he offer plea bargains to indicted felony suspects , no matter the cost to the court system now , after nearly seven months , the granite walls of the bronx county courthouse have not tumbled down as many had feared yet mr johnson s unorthodox approach has begun to strain the criminal justice system the backlog of cases in the bronx , already the city s worst , has grown , even as the overall crime rate has dropped dismissals have risen 35 percent , in part because prosecutors cannot try cases within the limits of speedytrial laws and rikers island officials complain that bronx inmates are a disproportionate burden at the jail plea bargains still flourish experts say it is difficult so early on to assess mr johnson s policy , though he calls it an unqualified success but there appears to be a growing consensus among lawyers , judges , academics and other authorities that mr johnson s policy is not the great step for justice that he suggests though mr johnson claims to be the district attorney who clamped down on plea bargaining a practice unpopular with a fearful public it still flourishes in the bronx , only now most of it takes place before indictment rather than after and while some say his idea is not bad , and compare it to a similar plan in nassau county that has won praise , they complain that he instituted the plan abruptly , in anger at one judge and without formulating a framework to make it work to me , before any policy can be assessed you have to define what the purpose of the policy is , said irwin shaw , director of the legal aid society in the bronx i do n't know what the purpose of his policy is others in this borough , where there are 10 , 000 murders , rapes , robberies and other serious crimes each year , are less circumspect 'it s madness' to eliminate the plea policy is not just folly it s madness , said acting justice joseph fisch of the supreme court , a tough sentencer usually considered a friend to the district attorney s office he was particularly upset because , under speedytrial rules , he may have to dismiss a case against a robbery suspect who was prepared to plead guilty in return for a lighter sentence because of the district attorney s policy , prosecutors had declined to accept the plea the policy has also fueled a ferocious clash of egos on one side is the borough s administrative judge , burton b roberts , a former district attorney noted for his hurricanelike voice on the other is mr johnson , a former judge who appears perpetually uncomfortable , who claims to disdain politics but smiled when he recalled recently what former mayor edward i koch told him about the policy he said if this works , i should run for mayor , mr johnson said for his part , mr johnson says that the policy is simple and , so far , successful his aim , he said , was to end automaticmarkdown justice since november , except in a few special cases , his office has stopped offering plea bargains to suspects who have already been indicted , unless they want to plead guilty to the top count , the most serious charge of the indictment before , he said , suspects would wait for as many as three separate plea offers before accepting the most lenient now , in what he calls a measure of the policy s success , mr johnson boasts that 77 percent of all defendants pleaded guilty so far this year to the top count they were charged with last year , the number of such pleas was 62 percent , and statewide , it is only 53 percent since the policy took effect , more felons have been sentenced to time in state prison and the number of pleas , or cases that do not go to trial because they involve an admission of guilt , are down , to 3 , 057 so far this year from 3 , 637 in the same period last year political points the focus here is more professional , mr johnson said it allows us to be tough , but also still leaves room for people to come to us in a real meritorious case but while he has made plea bargaining an issue and reaped political points for railing against it his critics note that the practice is alive and well before a case reaches the grand jury , usually within five days of arrest beyond that , in an effort to keep the courts from overflowing , mr johnson has been screening cases more carefully as they come in , often reducing cases that were originally filed as felonies to misdemeanors the percentage of cases reduced to misdemeanors so far this year is 38 percent of 3 , 102 cases , compared with 32 percent of 3 , 015 cases in the same period last year mr johnson s inability to end plea bargaining seems to have proven a point he did not intend just how dependent he and the rest of the nation s courts are on the practice , despite the public s distaste for it the oldfashioned notion of justice that a person is accused and then tried before a judge and jury has long been the exception rather than the rule in the bronx and elsewhere last year , only 6 percent of the 9 , 670 cases in the bronx went to trial nearly all of the rest involved some sort of plea , either to the top count of the indictment or to some lesser charge need for negotiations
this is not a pretty story it begins one christmas morning , when i was 6 years old and my paternal grandmother s boyfriend , uncle leo , sat on and broke my hoursold shellac recording of tubby the tuba it was my first record , and i had played it only once i cried all day and vowed then and there to collect as many records as i could and guard them with my life never again would my peace of mind and ease of soul be forfeit to another human being collecting the records was only a matter of money as a child , i was fully conversant with the concept of the layaway plan i took afterschool jobs at the public library shelving books and at the robin hood cafeteria carrying trays to ransom my copies of the little engine that could and hansel and gretel from the local record shop dickens would have wept preserving my hoard against the uncle leos and little brothers of this world had become easy with the introduction of the vinyl longplaying record , a scientific achievement i placed alongside dr jonas salk s i would never get polio , and my phonograph records were unbreakable the world was my oyster and then i heard a recording of the tenor beniamino gigli singing recondita armonia from puccini s tosca i thought it was the most beautiful sound i had ever heard in that one fatal instant , i became that most fabled , most insatiable collector of recorded sounds the operalover now i had to own every recording of that aria , that tenor , that opera , that composer and , ultimately , every note of operatic music ever committed to disk or tape i was out of control freud had missed his ultimate challenge if psychiatry could explain my need to collect records , i still would n't want to be cured it s given me too much pleasure collectors of anything are always being challenged to explain or defend their obsessions why \? all i can say is that we 're not doing what glenn close did to michael douglas and we pose no threat to national security or morale like sex , collecting records is fun people have been doing the one since adam and eve and the other since thomas edison but unlike sex , you can do it with a headache or even when still getting over the flu , which is why some people actually prefer it i am not one of them , but that s another story lp s were unbreakable , but they could be scratched the tape format arrived in time to replace our worn copies of der rosenkavalier , conducted by herbert von karajan , on angel with a scratchfree copy on cassette or open reel the trouble with tapes was finding the exact spot where anything other than the beginning of a piece actually began an aria , for example and the annoying amount of blank tape to run off on cassettes with sides of different lengths if god had not invented the compact disk with its instant access to precise cuing points , an opera collector would have it was only a matter of time having it all of course , the true , unregenerate opera collector has every recording in every format that same gigli tosca from its early 78 rpm incarnation in 1938 through the 45 rpm box edition and lp double album of the 50 s to its metamorphosis into the shiny cd available today the reason to own all these formats is the artwork of the covers \( different in every edition \) and the librettos , program notes and pictures of the artists but reason not the need count your lucky stars instead the value of recordings to modern musical culture cannot be overemphasized someone my age or younger would otherwise have no impression of the sound of caruso s voice , for example of course , a recording is not the same as the real thing \( ella and memorex notwithstanding \) , but in the great neapolitan s case or nellie melba s , the utter void without some suggestion even of the sound they made is unthinkable they also make wonderful souvenirs of artists we have treasured in our lifetime who are now silent the soprano eleanor steber will live forever in her definitive performance of samuel barber s knoxville summer of 1915 besides , this is a creator s recording steber herself commissioned the piece and sang its world premiere one assumes barber was pleased with what he heard thanks to recordings , we can still hear verdi s first otello , the tenor francesco tamagno , or puccini s boheme as led by its original conductor , arturo toscanini people who do n't get a tingle at the thought of putting on something that close to being present at the creation are people i do n't think i want to know playing the easytoget with the advent of the cd , record collecting has become a relatively simple and inexpensive passion the big chains like tower records have knocked out of business those outoftheway specialty shops in manhattan like discophile on west eighth street , where you could find a hina spani singing heartstopping verdi or a miguel fleta having a vocal and probably emotional epiphany singing e lucevan le stelle from tosca instead , these once scarce and very expensive imported recordings have now been transferred 15 or so arias apiece to budget recital disks , which shops like tower and hmv display with a profligacy unthinkable even 10 years ago , and at prices a fraction of those charged for the shellac pressings with which most older collectors began in fact , the thrill of the hunt is gone , but the availability of these oncescarce treasures is a happy recompense
the fans who cheer him , the reporters who cover him , the majority of people who meet him , will never get close to him that is the way patrick ewing wants it his passion for privacy will undoubtedly hurt him in the balloting for this year s national basketball association most valuable player award so be it his passion for privacy also has cost him some endorsements and commercials he 'll live with it it cost him in this season s allstar balloting , when shaquille o'neal was voted by fans in a landslide to start over ewing he accepted it perhaps the only way ewing would allow himself to be more commercialized , more publicized , or more scrutinized , would be if it helped the knicks win a championship but none of the people who want ewing to open up , or to share more of himself , can help him win so ewing remains unchanged , and he continues to chase his dream of winning a championship with the knicks he plays , and he lives , on his terms i like who i am , and i'm very comfortable with the way i am , ewing said in a recent interview i'm a laidback , normaltype person there are other guys who always want the spotlight , but not me i can do without all that i just want to win a championship my career will be somewhat unfulfilled , in my mind , until i win one as the knicks prepare to start the playoffs tonight against the indiana pacers , ewing has never felt better about his chances of winning an nba title coincidentally , ewing , who is 30 , is among a group of nba stars who have reached their 30 s still pursuing their first nba title charles barkley \( phoenix \) , hakeem olajuwon \( houston \) , dominique wilkins \( atlanta \) and clyde drexler \( portland \) are in the same boat , or make that the same yacht , with ewing chasing a title before time runs out it had to be annoying for ewing , barkley and drexler last summer , when members of the united states olympic team needled one another , and someone like magic johnson or larry bird or michael jordan would say , at least i have a ring not that ewing is obsessed by the game he likes cars , music , working out but most of all , spending time with family and close friends ewing and his wife , rita , and their 2yearold daughter , randi , split time between a residence in new jersey and their offseason home in maryland ewing also has an 8yearold son , patrick jr , who lives with his mother in massachusetts but maintains a close relationship with his father he s a pretty big basketball fan , and he s going to be tall , ewing said of his son but i talk to him more about his schoolwork than basketball determination to win but during the playoffs , it is ewing who will be tested always driven , ewing is even more determined to lead the knicks through the finals , and his teammates sense it he has been saying a lot of things the last couple of months , said knicks forward charles smith he has definitely opened up his mouth more the last two months than he has all season we 'll walk in at halftime and he 'll say , 'we 're playing lousy , let s go' saturday before the chicago game , the last thing he said before we left was , 'i'm coming to play sunday , and the rest of you guys better come with it' you remember after the dream team was done , and jordan and scottie pippen were talking about coming to camp late \? patrick did n't miss one day of training camp and he worked harder than anybody he s driven by something , and i think it s getting that ring he wants to prove a point so ewing keeps pushing himself and his teammates walk into the knicks locker room before a game , and ewing is deep into his pregame ritual , staring at the videotape of that night s opponent , headphones on , listening to a compact disk through the headphones , handling a basketball between his hands , almost oblivious to the happenings around him i listen to a lot of different music before games rap , reggae , rhythm and blues , but it has to be something that gets the juices flowing , ewing said prelude to a championship \? and once the game begins , no one plays it with more intensity than ewing numbers only scratch the surface of what he has meant to the knicks this season averaging 242 points , a careerhigh 121 rebounds and 199 blocked shots more than ever before , he has made clutch plays to win games and for the first time in his eightyear career , the knicks won 60 games , which is often the prelude to winning a championship with only five players back from last season s team , ewing willingly joined cocaptain charles oakley to become the team s unquestioned leaders that role conflicts with ewing s reserved personality , but at some point he decided that if the team needed more vocal direction from him , he would provide it yet when ewing was asked if he has become more of a leader this season , he responded i think i 've approached things about the same that was a typical ewing answer short , understated , nonrevealing postgame interviews are the only kind that ewing conducts regularly he rarely grants interviews after practice he hardly ever grants interviews on game days
berlin the accidents of travel find me writing about a new recording of kurt weill s last completed piece of musical theater in the city in which he made his reputation and in which , according to two related schools of thought , he did his only important work the score is lost in the stars , a musical weill wrote with his playwright friend maxwell anderson it was based on alan paton s novel about south african racial injustice and reconciliation , cry , the beloved country , and opened on broadway in 1949 after 273 performances there , it toured nationally and was revived on broadway , on film and in opera houses the most notable operatic revival came in 1958 , early in julius rudel s tenure as artistic director of the new york city opera mr rudel here conducts the orchestra of st luke s in the score s first honest representation on records \( musicmasters 0161267100 cd \) , in contrast to the stalwartly sung but brutually cut original cast album \( mca mcad10302 cd \) the music weill composed as a refugee from nazism in the united states , where he lived from 1935 until his death in 1950 , has been unfairly dismissed the german playwright bertolt brecht and his intellectual heirs sought to downplay weill s contributions to the brecht collaborations \( the threepenny opera , the rise and fall of the city of mahagonny and others \) by suggesting that in america weill had capitulated cravenly to greed , sinking quickly to the level of a hack there is also a european prejudice , a snobbish disdain for colonial pretensions , based on an elitist and austere notion of modernist esthetics david drew , weill s staunchest champion in britain , called the composer one of music s great mighthavebeens , since he had abandoned his supposed modernist mission even stephen hinton s fairminded assessment of weill in the new grove dictionary of opera , which chides mr drew for that remark , summarizes weill s career as a movement from european highbrow to american middlebrow , the latter a cultural context to which he adapted with apparent ease but which most of his american works ultimately transcend though true in a sense , this contention does injustice both to broadway and to weill s consistency of vision he sought simultaneously to sustain the operatic tradition and to communicate with a contemporary audience through popular musical idioms weill s works were original and progressive within their contexts on both sides of the atlantic had he lived past the age of 50 , he would undoubtedly have contributed more actively to the american fusion of popular entertainment and accessible opera even in his time , he was hardly alone the 1930 s , 40 s and 50 s were a period of active experimentation on broadway , with all sorts of composers and authors striving to produce serious , commercially viable scores , from virgil thomson to richard rodgers to gian carlo menotti to leonard bernstein , leading , in direct descent , to stephen sondheim far from being a wasteland , new york at midcentury was full of lively , ambitious and idealistic people trying to create a serious american hybrid of operas and musicals as mr hinton points out \( and as thomson recognized in his critical writings in the new york herald tribune \) , weill s american career represented a constant attempt to find new solutions to the problems posed by this effort we need more modern recordings on the level of this release to put his whole achievement in proper balance but even if his works were not uniformly successful , all were seriously intended and completely compatible with his german aspirations the very theme of lost in the stars attests to its moral earnestness indeed , the \( literally \) preachy text can ring a bit stilted to modern ears but paton s novel and weill s musical relating the story of a zulu preacher , his son \( who is hanged for killing a white man \) and his grandson , mirrored by three generations of whites who struggle to embrace racial harmony have unfortunately lost none of their timeliness and the music , tuneful yet ingenious and stirring , warrants revivals as well the new recording , at nearly 72 minutes , is almost twice as long as the cast album one number cut during rehearsals is restored , but the main reason for the added length is that finally , lost in the stars is presented in a way that recalls weill s bold original intentions this is really a choral play , as the musicmasters notes describe it , and in that sense not far removed from john adams s death of klinghoffer set songs and distinct numbers are foreign to its essence , which is a flowing , seamless depiction of the unfolding tragedy in almost cinematic terms , with the chorus taking on a variety of roles the producers of the cast album tried to break up this flow into separate numbers like those of a conventional broadway show , distorting weill severely in the process the new account sounds remarkably fresh in its orchestration \( weill did his own \) and supple in its dramatic structure the concert chorale of new york is excellent , and the leading roles are well sung by gregory hopkins , arthur woodley , reginald pindell , cynthia clarey and carol woods \( although the zulu accents in the expanded dialogue sound misguided \) mr rudel s conducting shows all the love and passion he says he felt during the recording sessions , and the album as a whole should play a vital role in the reevaluation of weill s american reputation
waco , tex , march 14 the federal siege against a heavily armed religious sect here entered its third week today amid some signs of weakening resolve among the 105 remaining cult members negotiators for the federal bureau of investigation said that a number of members of the branch davidian sect had asked for details about the judicial process and what charges they might face if they were to surrender a favorable sign , in the words of the chief bureau spokesman here , bob a ricks the sign came on a bright sunday morning in central texas , exactly 14 days after the standoff began with a wild shootout at the sect s compound , 10 miles east of waco another death reported there was an indication today that a third sect member may have been killed in the shootout , in addition to the two confirmed deaths scott peterson , the courtappointed lawyer for kathryn schroeder , who left the compound on friday night , said in an interview that she had told him of the death of a 38yearold man she identified as perry jones federal authorities would neither confirm nor deny the assertion tonight , authorities at the site turned bright lights on the cult s compound in what a spokeswoman called a tactical maneuver he did not explain what the tactic was supposed to accomplish it was difficult for reporters to determine what was happening inside the compound , because the federal authorities cut off outside lines and prevented the four adults who had come out from being interviewed the chief source of information has been a daily news briefing by spokesmen for the fbi and the bureau of alcohol , tobacco and firearms , which staged the feb 28 raid in an attempt to arrest the cult s leader , david koresh , on illegalweapons charges mr ricks said today that ms schroeder had told him that members of the sect , a renegade offshoot of the seventhday adventist church , henceforth wanted to be known as koreshians this afternoon sect members displayed a banner reading , fbi broke negotiations we want press it was unclear what prompted the message on saturday , three cult members were said to be ready to give up , but they have not surrendered nor is there any indication that mr koresh has softened his stance against surrender none of the 11 fbi negotiators have spoken to him since late friday night , and there was heightened concern today that the 17 children remaining in the compound had in effect become tactical pawns , shielding the sect against a new federal assault mr ricks said members had been told those who surrendered would be held as material witnesses until investigators could sort out who was responsible for the deaths of four firearms bureau agents in the shootout what we are facing is a very difficult situation where fire was indiscriminately coming out of the compound , mr ricks said this morning wo n't specify charges federal officials declined to specify possible criminal charges against the sect members but local prosecutors have cited a variety of potential state and federal charges , including murder , assault and weapons violations it s left to the imagination , said charles rosenthal , first assistant district attorney for harris county in houston , who is not involved in the waco case they 've committed all sorts of weapons crimes he said the state and federal governments could each prosecute for assault on peace officers in texas , the death penalty can be sought for the murder of more than one person in the same episode or for the killing of an officer executing his duty from my own standpoint , this is a death penalty case , mr rosenthal said the negotiators have not offered to lessen the charges to induce mr koresh to surrender we do n't get into discussions like 'do you know you 're facing the death penalty \? ' mr ricks said but he added , we have not minimized what he s facing during the first few days of the standoff , the sect released 41 children to the authorities all or most of the 17 who remain are believed to have been fathered by mr koresh , who considers many of the female sect members to be his wives there were further discussions , too , about the wounded cult members in the compound one , scott kojiro sonobe , a 35yearold landscape architect from honolulu , was told by doctors on the telephone that he might lose the use of his right hand , injured in the shootout , if not treated soon but he was said to be concerned about criminal charges mr sonobe was recruited by the sect in honolulu in 1986 seeks to speak for cult mr ricks said ms schroeder , whose husband was killed in the shootout , wanted to serve as a spokeswoman for the cult but since her surrender she has been held as a material witness and could not be reached for comment mr peterson , said in an interview this afternoon that ms schroeder had come out to see her young son and to serve as a conduit between the authorities and the sect she does n't want to do anything right now that would endanger the lives of anybody , mr peterson said she and the fbi agent in charge are in agreement that they both want a peaceful end to the situation she is being held in the county jail until a detention hearing on tuesday he added that since her surrender ms schroeder had spoken by phone to steve schneider , mr koresh s chief lieutenant , and had told him she had been treated decently by the agents he said she had encouraged mr schneider to urge the injured , who include his wife , to come out for medical treatment ms schroeder remains loyal to the sect and has kind things to say about mr koresh , mr peterson said she said life had been disrupted inside the compound since the siege began , with less time for worship , the lawyer said there was no electricity , he added , but plenty of food a year s supply , he said one year
to the editor anna quindlen s focus on the brightchild syndrome in public schools in dumb about smarts \( column , nov 7 \) is fuzzy with oneline solutions no , the public school system does n't take care of its brightest students , but her random jabs at the problem do n't solve it more money tracking better role models money should n't be a consideration until there s a plan for improvement that starts with a teacher consensus that all the students are their responsibilities to teach role models \? nonsense so long as situation comedies , mtv and movies hold up illiterate , foulmouthed and lascivious millionaires and politicians as icons , we the parents and the teachers , not the mass media cast them in the hero mold this generation of adults may itself be so hooked that it ca n't protect its children from them as for tracking now there s a theory gone astray and it s the fault of teachers taking the easy way who ca n't teach bright children bright things and slower children dumb things \? there s nothing wrong with tracking in theory it used to work when i was a kid , preworld war ii , being educated by jesuits students were taught the same basic courses at the same high level by dedicated teachers that takes hard work but it was successful we were separated roughly by ability levels in some , but not all courses we were all taught shakespeare , latin , history , math , science , languages through high school some of us soared in fields where our talents lay and plodded through less inspirational valleys the teachers were dedicated to the proposition that every one of us would achieve children exposed to tracking today are being taught different things if children on one track are reading shakespeare , those on another are reading just above comicbook level the thirdtrack child will never achieve educational compatibility with the firsttrack child , which stigmatizes the lowertrack child for life and grossly impairs motivation those advocating the tracking system choose not to understand , for example , that every child in a threetrack system can , really can , be taught to read and understand julius caesar , while perhaps only the inspired child will go on to king lear in later years , children so taught will have shakespeare and an appreciation of language as a basis , among other educational values , for a commonality of interests perhaps none of what s wrong with the public school system can ever be righted until discipline can be enforced and we discard the idiotic notion that the civil rights of students include the right to misuse school facilities and not to work if they so choose neil sullivan scarsdale , ny , nov 11 , 1993 drawing
huntington , ind , june 17 clarisa , an artist with a mass of raven black hair and only one name just like cher drove all the way from milwaukee with her 3d laminated brass portrait of dan quayle she hoped to contribute the work , which depicts mr quayle climbing the stairway of politics , with a cross in the background , to the dan quayle center and museum , which opened in the former vice president s hometown today she had , after all , sent one of her brassy portraits , with liz emblazoned on it , to elizabeth taylor for the star s 60th birthday and received a thankyou note in return 'cream of the cream' but thomas mehl , the curator of the first vice presidential museum to honor a living person , refused to help clarisa carry it inside , apparently not considering it quite right for his exhibit , huntington to washington the dan quayle trail we have the cream of the cream here , mr mehl , a 31yearold graduate student , said as he looked around proudly at glass cases displaying such quayle collectibles as his high school letter sweater \( with a golf bag insignia \) a red , white and blue golf bag from his senate days baby pictures his fifthgrade report card , which showed he was once considered a pretty good speller his uniform for the huntington kiwanis little league team a small red sweatshirt with his mother s handsewn danny on the front a car registration for a 1977 yellow plymouth the quayles' wedding announcement in the huntington heraldpress , and mr quayle s law degree with the bottom chewed off by the family dog , barnaby , who is shown in an accompanying snapshot looking not at all repentant just as andy warhol predicted in the 1960 s that everyone would get 15 minutes of fame , so now , this small heartland town is promoting the notion that every politician deserves 15 minutes of history among the people who are flabbergasted at such an idea is paul light , a professor at the humphrey institute at the university of minnesota who is an expert on the vice presidency to begin with , he said , even for a vice president who was not as underutilized or underprepared as dan quayle , it takes a fair amount of hubris to have a museum named in one s honor while one is alive pointing out that hubert h humphrey and walter f mondale did not have their own museums and neither did most vice presidents through history he added certainly , it does set a new standard for the creation of museums if dan quayle can have one , i shudder to think of all the politicians in washington and in state capitals who will want them dubious dental event quayle boosters here are hoping that with so much carping about the new clinton administration , the time might be ripe for some nostalgia about the quayle years as william kristol , a conservative analyst in washington who was mr quayle s chief of staff \( but just could n't make it to huntington for the opening \) , wryly notes if clinton keeps going in this direction , people will want a john sununu museum and a sam skinner museum in a couple of years one of the first visitors this morning to the beige brick building that was once a christian science church was gene snowden , the republican mayor of huntington , resplendent in white jacket , red pants , white shoes and matching american flag tie he was certain the museum would be a success , judging from the attention mr quayle attracted last year when he visited a dentist in town two thousand people crowded around to see him while he was getting his teeth fixed , the mayor said two thousand \? his wife , carol , repeated dubiously surplus historical stuff marj hiner , the secretary of the museum foundation and the owner , with her husband , homer , of a local trucking company , said , a lot of people wait 50 years , after the person is gone , but we had all his history laying right here , so why not do it while he s still living \? mrs hiner said that mr quayle was pretty amazed when a group of townsfolk approached him about setting up a museum with private donations but the quayle family ended up contributing loads of stuff , as the museum founders call their mementos only a small percentage of quayle detritus is on display , but the museum executives hope to put out more once they get going the quayles are expected for the formal dedication in september and have indicated they may drop by before that although mr quayle has urged the museum founders to set up some hightoned symposiums on the duties of the vice president , mrs hiner said that most people are more interested in his childhood and his life 'in the consoletion' following this philosophy , the museum makes no pretense to historical heft instead of state documents , visitors may peruse a letter written by the former vice president to his uncle gene pulliam after the 1959 phoenix jaycee junior golf tournament qualifying day i shot a 56 , he wrote , in a handwriting that sloped steeply down to the right i was in the consoletion \( despite his good marks in spelling in his fifth grade report card from kiva grade school in scottsdale , ariz , mr quayle s problem with misapplied e s seems to have appeared early \) in that report card , the young mr quayle also received exemplary marks for behavior , dependableness , courtesy , cleanliness , care of property and work habits music and geography were trouble spots that year mr mehl , who is getting school credits from eastern illinois university for his work at the museum , keeps the tone light and positive the richard nixon presidential library may feature selected watergate tapes , but at the dan quayle museum , there are no detours into dark corners of the quayle legacy none of the famous quayle gaffes are recalled the time he bought an anatomically enhanced male doll in chile to the horror of his wife , or the time he misspelled potato for a group of schoolchildren truth at the souvenir stand for now , visitors will have to settle for a book on sale at the souvenir stand things the media , talk show hosts , and liberals never tell you about dan quayle a sample meaningful accomplishment from the book he has surprised many members of the press because unlike most politicians he is able to discuss complex and technical information accurately without referring to notes or deferring to aides a sample accurate quote our diversity is our strength a sample vital statistic during the 1968 republican convention in miami beach , fla , he was a driver for the nixon entourage giving an interview to a local television reporter , mrs hiner said the museum would be an inspiration to everyone it illustrates that you can go to school , ride horses , play golf , get decent grades and look what you can become
philadelphia jim fregosi sat at his desk last monday , trying not to bask too obviously in the earlyseason feats of his philadelphia phillies with a victory that night , fregosi knew , the phillies could establish their best start ever , with 23 victories in 30 games but this was in philadelphia , so at that point , a veteran scribe , who has forgotten more about phillies' history than any current member of the tribe ever knew , asked an obvious philadelphia question did fregosi know , the writer asked , what happened to the last philadelphia manager whose team had won 21 of his first 28 games \? of course fregosi did not know \( why would he \? \) and of course there was a punch line danny ozark was the manager and his '79 phillies managed to win only 63 more games and wound up in fourth place with an 8478 record he was replaced by dallas green before the season ended fregosi just sat there and smiled this was , after all , philadelphia , as tough a sports town as ever existed but fregosi will not be bullied by the weighty philadelphia history , or be overly inflated by the 1993 team s amazingly successful start i 've been around this game a long time , he advised the philadelphia press corps everyone has his ups and downs so enjoy fregosi is and his smile suggested more because fregosi knows what the rest of the national league is finding out that the tough town has a tough team and , most important , a winning team if looks could kill even the look suggests the toughness center fielder lenny dykstra , it seems , walks to the plate to lead off a game with dirt on his uniform reliever mitch williams , the man who says he pitches as if his hair were on fire , changed his number to 99 , just like a character called the wild thing in the movie major league why \? because williams is the living and breathing wild thing , aging fregosi but toting up saves faster than most anyone in the league then there s john kruk , the everyman hero of philadelphia , the rotund , bearded one who is most likely to be voted poster boy of the south philadelphia softball league all told , the look , with all the scruffy beards and flowing manes , is reminiscent of harvey s wallbangers , the motorcyclegang lookalikes who rocked and rolled in milwaukee in the early 1980 s and the reputation for high jinks and low esteem for anything sacred brings to mind the antics of the rambunctious gas house gang in st louis if you 're a member of the philadelphia phillies , you have to like the comparisons because harvey kuenn s brew crew and the gang that made st louis famous won this phillies team could , too , if early trends mean anything best start ever the phillies won that game last monday night , by 51 over the pirates , for the 237 start and they entered their game yesterday in atlanta with a 249 record , the best in the major leagues but they were on a minislide , having lost two straight games remarkably , it was only the second time this season the phillies had dropped two straight , the first such time coming april 1617 in chicago still , the phillies enjoyed a fiveandahalfgame lead over secondplace montreal in the national league east before yesterday s games so , the fun would continue , and the winning , too the bottom line is it s a lot of fun because we have some very funny guys on this team , said shortstop mariano duncan as he glanced at the veterans row in the veterans stadium clubhouse before the game against the pirates last week what he gazed upon is a corner that houses not only players of character , but characters who can play like kruk , darren daulton , williams , the comedic and sage pitcher larry andersen , and barrelchested pete incaviglia they form a group so ribald and off the wall that dykstra , one of the founding members of the row , considers himself mellow by comparison they remind me of the old mets , only hungrier , dykstra said they 're pretty wild in here , he continued , referring to the clubhouse , and i started it , i guess but they 're serious about the game and they want to win , bad williams agreed the clubhouse is where we have fun , where we stay loose , he said , referring to a place also known as the inner circle and the ghetto but the fun , he added , has a purpose it s what the phillies use to bury the sort of bad vibes that would sink a more serious and desperate lot no one on this team can get down , said williams no one can rest we wo n't let him because no subject s taboo no subject at all take , for instance , some mammoth shots that williams yielded in his old stomping ground , wrigley field , on april 18 home runs that helped extend the phillies to the limit in an 1110 brawl i could have hung my head , williams said and on other clubs , maybe guys do n't say anything to you but when i got in the clubhouse , it was like 'hey , mitch , you threw the ball a long way how far did it go \? do n't keep that up ! the humor has helped to create a closeness and a positive attitude here that just did not exist in years past and it started in spring training , said second baseman mickey morandini we won there for the first time in a long time , and you could see things coming along then we went to houston and swept the first series and the attitude has carried on ever since , it seems through every game classic signs of good things to come continue to build when duncan hit a grand slam in the eighth inning of a game against st louis on may 9 , it was the eighth time the phillies had used a home run to win a game this season the next night , in that monday night game , daulton used another grand slam to stun pittsburgh last year , the phillies were often treated like a doormat by national league west teams , finishing 2844 versus outerdivision opponents this season , the phillies are 164 against the west they are 52 against the san francisco giants and the houston astros the two winningest teams in the west a large part of the success can be attributed to additions brought in by general manager lee thomas the team started the year with 10 pitchers , none of whom are products of the phillies' farm system starting pitchers danny jackson \( healthy and winning \) and curt schilling \( a steal from houston , and winning \) have been a boon so have productive role players like new additions milt thompson , incaviglia and jim eisenreich the attitude , fregosi said , is directly tied to the blend of players sure , you map out a plan , but you never know till you get them all together and see how they fit they fit still , remembering that it s early , and that it s a tough division and a tough town , tempers every thought the phillies have of october but they know where they 've been the organization , which has not visited the postseason since 1983 , knows what is possible we 've been there a couple of years with the losing , said wes chamberlain , the right fielder we 've had that experience we do n't want to go back
the pugilist at rest stories by thom jones 230 pp boston little , brown company 1895 writers as good as thom jones appear but rarely the original poetry of his fictional world is irresistible , and the sense that he knows this world absolutely has cleansed his prose and produced an affectless sheen the pugilist at rest , mr jones s first book , is a collection of 11 stories arranged in four sections , bound thematically as well as by philosophical references that provide a sometimes sardonic and antithetical context for the excruciating clarity and vividness of the writing the tone is one of almost unremitting pessimism in these eventful and grim , thoroughly active tales , americans find themselves enslaved to what one is tempted to call destiny , in view of the sweeping determinism with which the author portrays war , narcotics , bureaucratic oppression and bad luck many of these stories are written in the first person , and i is such a slippery individual that the thought police are going to have their work cut out for them separating the author from his narrators the stories in the first section are about the war in vietnam , primarily , and about its aftermath in injured lives i frankly wonder whether anyone has written better about this war or better caught its terrifying otherness the common voice of these soldiers and of the author himself is not what we have become accustomed to the soldier as bystander , paralyzed by ambivalence , or the soldier as mourner the men of these stories are outright warriors they do n't really understand the national story that placed them here , but they buy it these men were , and in some cases will again be , ordinary citizens in ordinary american towns but for now the heart of darkness has become the self of darkness , and the american capacity for efficient violence is raised to a shock wave of perception after reading mr jones s accounts of men on reconnaissance in southeast asia , you look at your countrymen differently his assertion , in the title story , that a kind of sadism springs from grief is one that lingers there was a reservoir of malice , poison and vicious sadism in my soul , and it poured forth freely in the jungles and rice paddies of vietnam i pulled three tours i wanted some payback i grieved i grieved for myself and what i had lost i committed unspeakable crimes and got medals for it it was only fair that i got a head injury myself none of this would work without the author s absolute authority , and it does work , despite the somewhat familiar terrain of rock 'n' roll , drugs , unspecific fear , horrible wounds viewed with detachment , that allconsuming vietnam zombieism that is so very different from the outoffocus injuries and encoded behavior of other wars for mr jones , death in vietnam is grotesque and ignominious recently living , dreaming men turned into kitsch statues or glistening semisolids , sometimes becoming projectiles themselves such horrors are the perfect backdrop for the narrator s cynical quotations from schopenhauer or twisted historical views \( it is thought that st paul had a temporallobe fit on the road to damascus \) out of the languor of killing come such cries from the heart as i wanted to give my buddies a good show ! that is , produce a stunning body count here , our rangers yearn for the purple field of heightened perception and trancelike power , a thoroughly dehumanized predatory state that will lead , they hope , to their survival and necessarily to the death of the enemy yet there is merriness in the face of stated gloom and , born of pain and reflection , a survivor s rakishness boxing , as a subject , resembles war for thom jones , not just because of its violence but also because of the way its practitioners , even its champions , are victimized by absurd , external and , finally , deterministic forces his boxers , like his soldiers , seem to be involved in some crazy experiment the intention of which lies well outside their understanding or they imagine themselves enacting a nietzschean will to power it is often most useful for them to assume they are the subject of a joke and that , while it may offer them small consolation , at least someone , unknown to them , is enjoying it even the enjoyment of others is heartening to these beleaguered people , who are reduced like true primitives to putting their faith in medical mumbo jumbo or dreams of eventual peace in stories like wipeout , sex and love offer a kind of politics of cruising , with abstract goals like action , breaking hearts and dumping resulting in the familiar outcome of extreme isolation in another story , mosquitoes , a los angeles emergencyroom doctor , ruled by his fascistic , darwinian social views , dreams of solitude and indulges his own version of the robinson crusoe story as with other of mr jones s isolatoes , he will bring his dogs , as well as a case of mosquito repellent with which , the reader imagines , he intends to banish the eumenides

hate on trial the case against america s most dangerous neonazi by morris dees and steve fiffer illustrated 280 pp new york villard books 21 on nov 13 , 1988 , a 28yearold ethiopian student named mulugeta seraw was clubbed to death by a gang of skinheads in portland , ore two weeks later , in the southern poverty law center in montgomery , ala , the organization s chief trial counsel , morris dees , studied documents provided by the portland police in 1987 , mr dees and other lawyers from the center successfully brought a civil suit that bankrupted the alabama chapter of the ku klux klan after several klan members were convicted of killing a young black man in mobile testimony from a remorseful klansman helped the victim s mother win a 7 million award , which included a klanowned building that she sold the three men convicted in connection with seraw s death were followers of the white aryan resistance , a neonazi group with headquarters in fallbrook , calif , led by tom metzger and his son john tom metzger , a television repairman , was a ku klux klan leader who jolted san diego in 1979 when he won 43 , 000 votes in a losing bid in a democratic congressional primary he broke with the klan and created his own hate group , with a cable television show by 1988 his operation was pulling in 100 , 000 a year both metzgers are rank merchants of hate but they were not in the state of oregon when mulugeta seraw was killed nevertheless , mr dees decided to initiate civil litigation against them , as well as the three convicted killers , on behalf of the seraw family hate on trial , by mr dees and steve fiffer , the duo who also wrote a book about the alabama klan case , a season for justice , presents mr dees s account of the 1990 oregon trial , in which he contended that the metzgers were liable in seraw s death because of the legal doctrine of vicarious liability if a party provides substantial assistance or encouragement' to the perpetrator , he can be held liable for the perpetrator s acts , the authors write clumsily , the metzgers represented themselves at the civil trial \( tom metzger s objection to a judge whose last name sounded jewish resulted in a switch the new judge s name , ancer haggerty , heartened mr metzger too late , he found out that judge haggerty was black \) the metzgers argued that the first amendment protected their freedom to disseminate their views and literature , and that they played no role in seraw s death mr dees and his colleagues argued that the metzgers , through the portland skinheads , had agreed upon a common objective that clearly contemplated injury to others nothing in the first amendment prevented imposing liability if such a conspiracy could be established our argument to the jury would be simple under our constitution , you have the right to hate but not to hurt david mazzella , an officer of tom metzger s group who provided crucial information about seraw s killers to the portland police , was the plaintiffs' star witness he emerges in hate on trial as a prototypical skinhead who changed only after seraw s death it was understandable that dave , who as a child had been shuttled among mother , father and grandparents , none of whom seemed to want him for long , had grown up to crave and need attention , the authors write he had received it for a while from the skinheads who had looked up to him as a leader and from the great tom metzger himself he had relished 'performing' on national talk shows of another skinhead , the authors write , he boasted of appearances on the talk shows hosted by oprah winfrey and morton downey , noting that the programs had even paid his air fare and lodging the trial itself was broadcast live on cable television in portland bill moyers later served as anchor of a public television program that presented the metzgers unalloyed , intercut with a panel of legal scholars who embraced mr dees s theory that free speech is not a license to hurt hate groups are violent their leaders , relying on euphemism , attract new members and new money through appearances in the mass media , usually on television putting klan and neonazi spokesmen on talk shows gives them a scrim of respectability , of celebrity what responsibility do the producers and hosts of these programs have in feeding the imagination of hate and violence \? on this , the authors say too little and given mr dees s obvious knowledge of how the mass media function \( his own skills at selfpromotion attest to that \) , his silence is a shame the trial occupies more than half of the book as mr mazzella holds his ground during tom metzger s crossexamination , the free speech boundary dissolves and the conspiracy theme emerges in full light the jury returned a 125 million judgment , which financially crippled the white aryan resistance although the lopsided legal conflict leaves the narrative a little short of dramatic tension , the descriptions of the people involved are well wrought , and a moral quest fuels this book with driving power
when gotham bar and grill opened in the early 1980 s , it epitomized the highliving , brashspending decade the warehouse space on east 12th street was an eclectic meld of newwave americana and italian moderne there were the stenciled checkerboard wood floor , the arts and crafts painted chairs , the gauzy , billowing parachute lamps hanging from the ceiling , the stippled walls and the faux capitals on the soaring columns that punctuate the rambling room the music boomed the crowd hollered to converse and windmilled in vain for absentee waiters the kitchen stumbled in its first month , i had two of the worst meals of my life at gotham bar and grill still , there was something compelling about the place maybe it was the restaurant s overblown ambition and its dogged commitment to live up to its own grand vision ten years later , gotham bar and grill has done that , and more under the tutelage of its chef , alfred portale , the kitchen has sustained its imagination but grown steadier , more reliable and workmanlike there are still glitches five years ago , i was served an ungutted panfried flounder last week i faced a quail the age of methuselah , perched on risotto with savory and swiss chard also recently , there was a squab whose age was not masked by the sweet roasted garlic and pancetta that came with it , and a dish of pasta tossed with smoked salmon and a cream sauce that had been reduced to a rich , salty glue when the kitchen goofs , it does so in grand style but it does so rarely usually , the groceries are squeakyfresh and handled solicitously skate wings sauteed in brown butter and served as a first course with an artichokeandwhitebean salad could have been eaten as sushi that fresh , that briny , and a brilliant counterpoint to the artichoke and buttery beans likewise , slender fillets of mackerel were delicious , quickly seared with slowgrilled tomatoes and a sprightly salad of arugula and chickpeas the house seafood salad , a tower of scallops , squid , octopus and lobster buttressed by avocado , is the kind of thing one dreams possible but only in a seaside restaurant ravioli of goat cheese snuggled up to ravioli stuffed with a husky caponata were tender and deliciously complemented by the sweet fennel broth and bits of roasted peppers and tart capers salads whether the tumble of mixed greens in sherry vinaigrette , the mountain of watercress and endive with a scaffolding of stacked beets , walnuts and strong roquefort , or the marinated goat cheese with leeks and sweet peas do not get better than gotham s none are lean cuisine the kitchen uses fine oils with abandon diet somewhere else as sprightly and fresh as gotham s cuisine appears , it is a worthy indulgence the dishes soar in height as well as flavor gotham bar and grill is the home of tall food the salads look like mountain ranges the delectable sauteed softshell crabs are perched high on pillars of grilled yellow and green squash that flank a pyramid of couscous and tasty baby bok choy the roast chicken is excellent , but it is served with such a towering haystack of fried matchstick potatoes that the diner s initial response is to call for a pitchfork and start making bales inevitably , the soaring constructions collapse and the diner becomes the cleanup crew this is not food made for first dates in fact , the sprawling restaurant itself is n't for cozy romance while there is now ample room between the whiteclothed tables and the music has been subdued , gotham bar and grill remains more a brasserie than a wellpadded luxury dining room but in that way , the place is very new york diners create an invisible bubble of intimacy around their tables that insulates but still lets them see and be seen since it is one of the few spots where tattered and paintspeckled tshirts mingle with armani suits , the crowd is alluring at gotham bar and grill , downtown meets uptown the avantgarde meets the establishment , the young and pretty chow down with the older and rich one wonders who is paying the check for the tables of struggling artists , students and lawyers too young to be partners the menu and intelligent wine list are pricey then again , the restaurant s airy , subdued style and the superb cooking are worth saving for even if i were n't on an expense account , i 'd order the sauteed halibut flanked with sweet grilled fennel and artichokes in a dillandgreenpepper vinaigrette or the monkfish roasted with manila clams and spicy portuguese sausage likewise , the bouillabaisse of scallops and giant prawns , mussels , squid and lobster is wonderfully fresh and soulful in a saffron broth grilled salmon is nicely complemented by blanched fava beans , wilted chard , chanterelles and a roasted corn custard the saddle of rabbit is stupendous , grilled and perfumed with wild fennel and served with spinach and white beans and the lamb , with its sweet garlic custard , the veal chop with mustard greens and the new york steak with a flan made of marrow and mustard are all excellent eating
the literary images presented in readings by claire bloom on sunday before each composition in the american symphony orchestra s first concert of the season were familiar of lady macbeth describing how easily she could dash out the brains of an infant sucking at her breast and of hamlet contemplating the nightmares that might haunt him even in death s sleep these , along with fleeting glimpses of desdemona and ariel , led directly into musical images and portraits far more obscure but quite fascinating orchestral works inspired by shakespeare and ably conducted by leon botstein , the orchestra s music director , at avery fisher hall the temptation is to put the word controversial before mr botstein s name , for as most listeners know by now , he is also the president of bard college and the editor of the music quarterly it has seemed unjust to many that out of an amateur s love of music and a parttime career , he has managed to become music director of a not insignificant orchestra and the dominant figure in the most important contemporary trend in concert programming during the last 50 years reviews of his first season at the helm of the troubled american symphony were , in fact , mixed often polite , sometimes less so , occasionally positive but just as his earnest summer festivals at bard have attracted an avid audience , so , too , has mr botstein s musical project with the american symphony the orchestra reports an increase in subscriptions of 15 percent over last season mr botstein described that now familiar project to the audience after intermission it is to redesign the concert format , to play music that is rarely heard and to present it in a thematic or historical context that can give it new meanings in this case , shakespeare provided the context , and the four works tchaikovsky s hamlet overture , john knowles paine s symphonic poem the tempest , dvorak s concert overture othello and richard strauss s symphonic poem macbeth were all written from the 1870 s to the early 1890 s this sort of thematic programming , mr botstein argued , is not a gimmick he is right and he has also been working hard to shed the image of the amateur that has haunted him mr botstein is not , of course , an orchestra builder and technician of the traditional mold there is often a lack of coherent focus in less driven or more exposed passages , as if small details distracted from the longer line and there were occasions when mr botstein tended to belabor phrases that would have been better used for atmosphere or implication rather than brute effect but mr botstein has a strong liking for the romantics of the late 19th century , and he dug into these scores with sympathy and intelligence he has minimized excessive arm gestures that led in the past to extraneous nuance his treatment of lyrical lines has become clean and robust there was genuine sweep when the music called for it , and the music spoke for itself mr botstein accomplished something important here later concerts this season , all at lincoln center , include accompaniment to the silent film of der rosenkavalier and a program on relationships between black and jewish jazz composers because of mr botstein s goals and because of the nature of the repertory he is programming , those who prefer to measure the precision of brass attacks or the fatness of the cello section s sound or to hear absolute precision in 16thnote patter are bound to be somewhat disappointed the performance standards are more modest here , but more than high enough to direct attention elsewhere , to an experience of musical novelty that was once offered large audiences by new compositions and here , the pieces justified the interest they were intriguing reactions to the passions and characters of shakespeare s plays although the work by paine , an american composer best known for his affiliation with harvard , was the least compelling \( it tended in its winsome sweetness to treat the tempest as if it were as you like it \) , each of the other works was fascinating there were images of lady macbeth s vigorous urgings , hamlet s pained equivocations , and the barely restrained fury of othello none of the musical programs , despite their often detailed allusions , could match the masterly language ms bloom read stripped of the particulars of phrase and image and construction , the plays' plots , after all , are often commonplace music cannot always replace the language it filters out but heard together , the compositions' many shared characteristics their use of joined bass and cello sections for ominous or fateful themes , their taste for percussion to mark military moments and instants of shock , their dialogue between innocence and energetic passion as part of sonata form show a nearly common view of shakespeare himself he seemed thoroughly at home in the waning years of european and american romanticism
washington , march 28 if trees are festooned with spanish moss in two biographies of abraham lincoln , is one author guilty of plagiarism \? no \? suppose the borrowings of words and felicitous phrases come to a total of 175 in a single book \? the definition of plagiarism passing off the work of another as your own once seemed rather simple but several recent cases have made it a matter of hot dispute , so much so that the american historical association has formed a committee to redefine the term and finetune the definition , including a sample list of firstdegree and seconddegree offenses how many duplicated words constitute plagiarism , or perhaps it is a question of which ones \? must the copying be deliberate , or is the fact of duplication enough \? fine or sharp distinctions \? the case of stephen b oates , a historian and popular biographer at the university of massachusetts at amherst , seems designed to test all the assumptions about what plagiarism is and whether academia can effectively deal with it professor oates is the author of with malice toward none the life of abraham lincoln \( new american library , 1978 \) , which has sold more than 100 , 000 copies since it was published and which , historians say , is the standard onevolume biography of the 16th president three years ago , robert bray of illinois wesleyan university , a fellow lincoln scholar , presented a paper at a historical conference in illinois , drawing attention to some similarities between professor oates s biography and abraham lincoln a biography \( knopf , 1952 \) , by benjamin p thomas , which was the standard onevolume biography at the time question of paragraphs among examples offered were two paragraphs from the biography by mr thomas , who is now dead herndon was something of a dandy in his younger years , affecting a tall silk hat , kid gloves and patentleather shoes five feet nine inches in height , thin , angular , erect , he moved and walked quickly with a superabundance of nervous energy darkskinned , with raven hair , he had sharp black eyes set deep in craterlike circles and from the oates work herndon stepped about in fancy clothes , a big silk hat , kid gloves , and patent leather shoes he was thin , stood about five feet nine , and had raven hair and black eyes the following year , mr bray and others took the evidence to the american historical association , which privately looked into the two dozen examples provided and also into accusations by others that dr oates plagiarized parts of two other books he had written last summer the association came down with a verdict or was it a hung jury \? yes , dr oates is guilty of something , the group said , sotto voce in a letter to the principals in the case , the historical association said dr oates s biography was derivative to a degree requiring greater acknowledgement of benjamin thomas s earlier biography and that the association concludes that he failed to give mr thomas sufficient attribution for the material he used the association strongly recommends that future editions give more credit to mr thomas but no , the association did not use the word plagiarism to describe what dr oates had done and of course , its arguments and detailed conclusions were private , though some people knowledgeable about the letter told reporters about it as readers about the events remained puzzled , each side quickly claimed victory i am very pleased , said the accuser , dr bray i am delighted , said the accused , dr oates , who now refuses to speak specifically about his case others appeal ruling nevertheless , another historian appealed the case to the offices of walter stewart and dr ned feder at the national institutes of health , two knowledgeable freelance scholars of academic improprieties and in the last few weeks , the scholars increased the stakes they have just finished running not only the lincoln biographies but also the two other oates books through their plagiarism machine , a computer program that scans and compares texts for exact matches in a letter to the american historical association , mr stewart and dr feder say they identified 175 instances of possible plagiarism in the lincoln biography and 340 instances in dr oates s biographies of the rev dr martin luther king jr and william faulkner far more instances than anyone had previously charged in addition , they examined several definitions of plagiarism , put out by various universities those rules range from prohibiting more than a line of repeated text to multipage explications of each type and style of plagiarism everyone has his own definition of plagiarism , said dr oates in an interview , adding that professional societies have failed to establish a clear and complete definition , or a procedure for adjudicating cases no way to clear name that failure , he said , means that those charged with plagiarism have no authority to appeal to once tarred with accusations , a scholar has no good way to clear himself the case comes amid anguish and selfdoubt among scholars what is the threshold for plagiarism \? one distinctive word \? a full sentence or paragraph \? what about a full sentence that contains no memorable phrases at all , versus two artful words \? does it matter if the work doing the borrowing is a scholarly work , or can popular writings borrow more freely \? dr oates said he was just not sure how small a borrowing might be to be counted as plagiarism in music , do n't they use eight bars \? he asked when he was a student , dr oates recalled , the definition of plagiarism was quoting more than four words without enclosing them in quotation marks
washington , dec 31 robert m gates , the director of central intelligence , has ordered a sweeping overhaul of how the cia maintains its vast store of files , government officials said today mr gates s order is a result of the embarrassment suffered by the central intelligence agency over its role in the criminal investigation of an atlanta branch of an italian bank the justice department complained in the summer that the nation s prime intelligence and espionage agency failed to submit crucial information in the files about the bank , banca nazionale del lavoro the cia said the failure stemmed from an unwieldy system of maintaining its secrets in october mr gates asked the agency s office of inspector general to review how the agency maintains both its computerized and paper files , and his decision to seek changes is in response to that report in addition to reporting on the agency s information retrieval systems , mr gates also ordered the inspector general to review the agency s performance in the criminal investigation of loans made to iraq by the atlanta branch of the italian bank , which has close ties to the government in rome questions about reputation in a letter to employees of the cia in october , mr gates lamented that the agency s reputation had been once more called into question over the bank fraud case and promised that the two reports would be completed by the end of the year while the report on the agency s filing system , in which it keeps millions of pieces of information , was completed earlier this month , the companion report on the agency s role in the bank fraud case is not expected to be done for another two weeks , intelligence officials said today specifics of the changes in the agency s informationretrieval systems are secret , the officials said , but the report recommends changes to insure that files are not so hidden from senior officials that they cannot be fully informed when asked for information computersecurity experts said the cia s system of filing its secrets is so compartmentalized for security s sake that it is often difficult or impossible to track down all relevant information on a subject at the same time , they said , the complicated system also provides a ready excuse for the agency when its officers want to withhold information events not clear it has never been clear in the banking case , for example , if the agency was unable to locate all the information about the bank or simply declined to provide it to the justice department the justice department last year indicted the manager of the bank s atlanta branch on charges that he defrauded the headquarters in rome in approving sizable unsecured loans to iraq the indictment followed intense debate between the justice department lawyers in washington and prosecutors in atlanta over whether the bank s leaders in rome were aware of the loans to iraq because prosecutors were charging the branch manager , christopher p drogoul , with fraud , it was crucial to know if the rome officials knew what was happening the prosecution fell apart at a tumultuous court hearing in september when the federal judge in the case , marvin h shoob , allowed mr drogoul to withdraw his guilty plea after the disclosures of how the cia withheld its information the agency often has found itself in the embarrassing position of belatedly finding information relevant to prosecutors and defendants in court cases during the trial this summer of clair e george , a former head of the agency s covert operations branch , the cia reported on two occasions that it suddenly discovered relevant documents in boxes under some desks \( mr george , who was convicted of lying to congress about the cia s role in the irancontra affair , was among six officials implicated in the irancontra affair who were pardoned last week by president bush \) plausible explanations one senior congressional aide said that the cia s claims have a the dog ate my homework quality , but are actually quite plausible given the agency s compartmentalized filing system in which some information , like that on covert operations , is stored separately with limited access yet it is also true , the aide said , that the complicated filing system provides a cover for the cia to withhold information the cia currently has more than 10 separate computer information banks and more than a million pieces of paper , intelligence officials said mr gates told reporters that when interest in the italian bank affair first surfaced publicly six months ago , he had more than three dozen agency employees working full time just to gather the information from the cia s separate filing spots in a sense , the cia is caught in a clash of cultures in which keeping secrets and making them accessible even to its own officials is inherently a conflict the agency , with its origins in the precomputer , paper age , still has tons of written files that have never been put into any information bank hard decisions peter g neumann , an independent computer security expert , said intelligence administrators faced a dilemma as to how they want to fashion their computer systems one one hand , he said , they could put everything into separate compartments , on data banks that are not allowed to mingle with each other but that would make for a highly inefficient system in which analysts and case officers are denied knowledge they need , said mr neumann , the principal scientist in the computer science lab of sri international of menlo park , calif the second approach , he said , is to pool all the information and allow access to everybody with a security clearance many of the cia s data bases operate independently of the telephone lines or other common carriers and are thus supposedly impervious to penetration from outside the agency also has always maintained that none of its systems of maintaining classified information are linked with any system containing nonclassified information
a few years ago , while dabbling in some fund raising for public schools , donald schupak , syracuse university class of 1964 , was taught a lesson by a savvy harlem principal an entire generation of unmotivated , unfocused and disenfranchised students was being lost in large , anonymous new york city high schools now mr schupak , an investment banker and a former horn hardart chairman , has persuaded his alma mater to do something about it syracuse university is sponsoring a new kind of city high school and offering its graduates special preference for admission and scholarships to cover tuition to the university the new school , the high school for leadership and public service , is part of a vast movement under way in the city to create as many as 50 new smaller , more intimate themebased high schools , intended to reach tens of thousands of students , many of whom are now headed for failure in traditional schools but when the leadership school admits its first ninthgrade class at the old stuyvesant high school in manhattan in september , it will have several unusual characteristics that take it beyond many other creative partnerships being developed between the city s board of education and museums , unions , colleges , neighborhood groups and even members of some black and hispanic churches within the city s five boroughs an unusual match the new high school for leadership represents an unusual match between a huge urban school system , with a reputation for bureaucratic gridlock , and a sprawling private university on a leafy hilltop campus 250 miles from new york city , with no obvious obligation to struggle with the city s particular mix of urban problems and educational inertia students are to be chosen for the new high school not strictly on merit but to represent the vast range of abilities in the city s public schools , from the brightest to the slowest readers those who excel will get to attend the university and to receive financial aid packages to cover the 19 , 000 annual tuition , room and board though classes at the high school will be taught by regular city teachers , faculty members from syracuse s respected school of government , the maxwell school of citizenship and public affairs which counts president clinton s secretary for health and human services , donna e shalala , among its graduates will help shape an innovative , handson curriculum that will bring students into city offices to learn how government works syracuse graduates will be recruited as mentors to the high school students , who will be able to audit university lectures with a sophisticated satellite hookup and attend summer classes on the syracuse campus rather than teaching students in blocks of traditional 50minute periods , syracuse officials hope to use projects like internships in government agencies to teach not just civics but everything from english literature to mathematics in an effort to make often obscure subjects more relevant more quickly transcending boundaries this school could be a factory for enfranchisement for an entire generation of disenfranchised and unmotivated students , said mr schupak , who attended public schools in mount vernon , ny , received an undergraduate and a law degree from syracuse and has worked for the last 18 months to bring the university and the school system together sandra ruppert , a policy analyst for the education commission of the states who is studying collegepublic school collaborations , said the new school may transcend the traditional boundaries of most cooperative ventures we found lots of good examples of innovative and creative programs , she said , but what they do n't do is change the way schools and colleges do business , and span the boundaries between them for most of this century , most public school officials believed that education was the domain of professionals , and high school teaching was best organized with the efficiency of a factory floor , with the school days divided into fixed periods , separated by ubiquitous school bells but in the last decade or so , with ever increasing concerns over dropout rates and educational failures , more and more educators have been struggling to find new ways to make teaching relevant through new ways of organizing the school day , and by making connections with institutions outside the school systems in new york city , the movement was given new impetus by studies that showed that students assigned to alternative high schools performed better than those who stayed in traditional neighborhood high schools though these new schools were not a priority of schools chancellor joseph a fernandez when he came to new york from miami , he quickly embraced the concept and pushed the school bureaucracy to find space for the new schools overcrowding in city schools and the availability of money to pay for extra leased classrooms also helped the movement along several private foundations , including the aaron diamond foundation and the fund for new york city public education , began a competition that selected 14 new school projects under development a team of educational reformers was given approval to start at least six small high schools that would eventually replace julia richman high school on east 67th street in manhattan
now that the toronto blue jays have proved they can repeat as american league pennant winners despite a wholesale change in their appearance , they go to the world series to see if they can repeat there , too , with their adaptable dozen the blue jays , who wrapped up the pennant tuesday night in chicago , have 12 players among the 25 who were not on their world series roster a year ago the most important cast changes were paul molitor playing the role of dave winfield and dave stewart as jack morris in becoming only the second team in the last 15 years to have a chance to win two successive world series , the blue jays have answered the widespread questions raised by their decision to make those changes last winter they lost most of their departed players as free agents , some of whom they tried to resign , some of whom they let go by economic design molitor , who played his first 15 major league seasons in milwaukee , was one of those signed as free agents to balance the large losses about two weeks before the start of the season , he discussed the effect the changes could have on the team difficult to measure it s a difficult thing to measure , he said then the irony is this is a championship ball club , and it has such a different look from last year there have been dramatic changes there will be inevitable comparisons when you 're successful and you make changes and then if you do n't do well , people will say if it ai n't broke , why fix it it was n't broke , and general manager pat gillick was only trying to fix the payroll , a major league high 495 million but by the time he was finished maneuvering , particularly with the lateseason addition of rickey henderson , the blue jays wound up with a payroll only slightly lower than last year , just shy of 48 million , with some postseason bonuses to be added it feels good , gillick said yesterday by telephone from toronto , discussing the team s success we moved a lot of people around out of necessity , more financial necessity than anything else it was n't that we wanted to get rid of the players they certainly would 've been welcomed back but we could n't handle it financially gillick , however , was delighted to pay out the latest 50 , 000 that sum goes to stewart as a bonus for being named the most valuable player of the league championship series that s good , gillick acknowledged i'm happy about that stewart was n't spreading the bonus among his teammates , but he was passing out accolades to me , this is the best ball club i 've played with , offensively , stewart said we 've got a lineup with so much talent we 've got guys who care about what they 're doing they take their jobs seriously they know what they have to do to win starting with paul molitor he s my favorite player he has an idea of what he has to do if there s a play he can make a bigger play , he goes for it when the blue jays let winfield go as a free agent and decided to sign molitor , five years younger , the popular view was that molitor could n't possibly contribute more offensively than winfield did but molitor topped winfield in batting average , 332 to 290 runs batted in , 111 to 108 slugging percentage , 509 to 491 , and onbase percentage , 402 to 377 he fell only four home runs short of matching winfield s total of 26 stewart comes through the stewart move was questioned , too the blue jays signed him for significantly less money than jimmy key and david cone would have cost them , and the skeptics were correct a combination of injuries and ineffectiveness limited him to a 128 record during the season but with two victories against chicago , he responded to the high standards he had established in four previous pennant playoffs when the season started with injuries , paul beeston and pat gillick said what s important is that i be able to pitch at this point of the year , stewart related regardless of what happened during the year , they expected me to come through at this time of year and stewart did , raising his playoff record to eight victories \( no other pitcher has more than four playoff victories \) and no losses in 10 starts , a 203 earned run average and a ratio of nine baserunners per nine innings with his victories against the white sox , stewart outdid the 1992 peformance of morris , who won 21 times during the season but lost three postseason games while winning none morris was back this season but suffered a seasonending elbow injury last month as they head into the world series , the blue jays have to watch for a change in stewart s effectiveness in six previous series starts , he has a creditable 249 era but a 23 record manager cito gaston indicated in the flush of playoff success that he would use his pitchers in the same order as he did against the white sox , meaning that juan guzman and stewart would start the first two games saturday and sunday gaston was n't prepared to say , but molitor most likely will start at third base instead of ed sprague in the three games in the national league city , when the designated hitter will not be used sprague was a member of the world series roster last year , but he batted only three times , all as a pinchhitter gaston does n't use pinchhitters much any more the blue jays were the last major league team to use a pinchhitter during the season darnell coles on may 13 , in the team s 34th game and gaston did n't call for one in six games against the white sox in fact , the same nine players played every inning of every game against the white sox all sorts of changes sprague has become the everyday third baseman , replacing kelly gruber tony fernandez has returned to play shortstop , a job vacated by manuel lee duane ward , who had been the setup reliever for the closer , has replaced the departed tom henke as the closer pat hentgen has moved into the starting rotation danny cox , al leiter and tony castillo are new to the world series bullpen , and veterans coles and dick schofield and rookies willie canate and rob butler are new to the reserve unit , the guys who do n't play gone are pitcher david wells , reserves pat tabler , rance mulliniks and derek bell and left fielder candy maldonado in maldonado s place , of course , is the enigmatic henderson when the blue jays acquired him from oakland july 31 , they expected him to lead the charge to the postseason but henderson has hit a stunningly low 202 for the blue jays , including 120 \( 3 for 25 \) in the playoff that kind of performance wo n't help the blue jays become the first team since the 197778 yankees to win two successive world series championships since then , only the athletics , with henderson on hand , have had a chance to repeat they won the earthquake series in 1989 and returned the next season but lost to cincinnati in four games table the cast changes , but the play is still a hit shows changes in the starting lineup of the blue jays from last year s world series team to this year s
st petersburg , russia the topoftheline tourist attraction in st petersburg is still what it always was the tour of the hermitage if the museum ranks level , in this respect , with versailles and the louvre rolled together , it is because that s exactly what it is , with additional echoes of the metropolitan museum , the british museum and the uffizi in florence there will never be anywhere quite like the hermitage for the presentation of so great a diversity of major art in an architectural wonderland for this reason , the fortunes of the hermitage in the tumultuous times that have broken out all over the former soviet union are a matter of international concern the worst potential calamities have been avoided nothing from the collections can or will be sold together with its friendly rival the russian museum in st petersburg , the hermitage has been formally ranked by president boris yeltsin among the top cultural institutions of russia this hardly needed to be spelled out the hermitage and the russian museum were also declared to be federal property , and for that reason exempt from privatization the operating budget of the hermitage is to be a part of the federal budget when the hermitage earns hard currency in one way or another , it is to have a new degree of autonomy in the use of that money substantial tax reliefs were also included in recent written assurances under its new director , mikhail piotrovsky , who succeeded in 1992 to the post to which his late father , boris b piotrovsky , had brought both an inimitable charm and an invincible gaiety , the hermitage has also begun to look abroad for corporate sponsorship in a report prepared for unesco earlier this year , written primarily by edmund pillsbury , director of the kimbell museum in fort worth , it was said that the hermitage currently earns about 20 percent of its operating budget from various forms of sponsorship , admissions and sales from its shops the cocacola foundation lately gave 300 , 000 toward the establishment of a new conservation studio \( it may be relevant that pepsicola for years had the monopoly of the cola market in the soviet union \) a joint russianamerican marketing company for the hermitage has been set up the french oil giant elf aquitaine is to sponsor important loans to the hermitage from the pompidou center in paris an international society called the friends of the hermitage is to be founded with the support of unesco it would therefore be a mistake to see the hermitage as a timewarped relic of the past whose staff has sat down and sobbed when trouble loomed meanwhile , for a foreign visitor to st petersburg , a tour of the hermitage remains mandatory business is brisk , visitors say to themselves when the great rooms look like peak hour at grand central station sometimes the tour takers are the archetypal captive audience packed in , motionless , like riders on the russian subway sometimes , on the other hand , they have to push and shove and break into a run to keep up with the guide either way , the tour is likely to bring both enrichment and a glorious confusion directions are rarely indicated englishlanguage labels are nowhere to be seen it is natural that group visitors from the west often become disoriented they may not resent it they may never see the greek sculptures , the buddhist paintings , the collection of coins \( over a million \) , the coptic rarities in the egyptian collections , the 18thcentury scientific instruments , the 8thcentury ceramics from samarkand or the relics of the stone age in russia but they will still have seen far more than any human being can master in a morning , or even in a month if rooms are closed as many are at this moment visitors may not sense that anything is amiss they may , in fact , come away with the impression that , all things considered , and given the heavy traffic , the hermitage is in pretty good shape that impression would not be well founded the hermitage is not in good shape there is much to be desired in the state of the buildings , the state of the collections , and the conditions in which devoted staff members go about their work the more than 300 rooms that make up the hermitage are spread out in the old hermitage , the new hermitage , the little hermitage and the colossal profusion of the winter palace the hermitage is bigger than many a small town its buildings are in many styles and were built or rebuilt at widely differing dates they do not age at the same speed or in the same way what suits one does not suit another the winter palace was gutted by fire in 1837 bombing , shellfire and inevitable neglect did much damage during world war ii , when the city endured one of the longest and most terrible sieges in history right now , roofs could leak , in bad weather , with catastrophic results both to the exhibits and to interiors that are themselves major works of art the dangers of fire cannot be overrated underground water and pervasive damp are a continual problem so is pollution in a great city long ringed by heavy industry of a primitive and brutal sort
austin , tex , april 29 despite two months of expensive , tiring campaigning by 24 candidates , saturday s united states senate primary still boils down to the basic question posed when the race began which republican will get the chance to challenge senator bob krueger \? while he appears to be in the lead , there seems to be no possibility that mr krueger , appointed in january to succeed lloyd bentsen after at least two others turned down gov ann w richards , can win a majority if no one wins a majority in one or both parties on saturday , there will be a primary runoff in early june so saturday will only tell whether kay bailey hutchison , the republican state treasurer , has been mortally wounded by charges that she hit an aide with a book and had her staff do personal work for her on state time if she has been hurt , representative jack fields , in his 13th year in the house , may slip past her into the runoff the republican battle matters because mr krueger has lost winnable senate races before and is widely considered vulnerable if republicans unite even so , the race is probably more closely watched in washington , where the loss of a democratic vote could make the senate even harder for president clinton to rely on heavy support from clinton in campaigning , mr krueger has made much of his opposition to president clinton s budget even so , he has enjoyed heavy support from the administration , including visits by cabinet officers and vice president al gore mr krueger s only opposition from liberal democrats comes from jose angel gutierrez , a former leader of hispanic political groups with little organized backing uncertainty about who will bother to vote makes politicians and poll takers guarded in their predictions the distractions of the siege of the branch davidian cult near waco , public fatigue with politics after last year s presidential contest and a general lack of excitement either from or about any of the candidates have prompted predictions of a low turnout the wild card one wild card is the uncertain effect of a hotly debated constitutional amendment that would legalize procedures for taking some tax revenue from rich school districts and sharing the wealth with poorer ones if enacted , it would end more than 25 years of legal disputes over disparities in education financing if it fails , a judge has threatened to shut the schools in early june this measure has some passionate foes who have scornfully labeled the schoolfinancing measure the robin hood plan , and that opposition may spur republican voting in affected communities but there is no clear sense of which republican would benefit more on the democratic side , governor richards s efforts to promote the measure are also likely to bring out black and hispanic voters , to the benefit of the spanishspeaking mr krueger but in the senate race itself , audiences for campaign appearances have often failed to reach two dozen people multicandidate events , like the campaign s final televised debate in houston tonight , have been echo chambers , where wealthy candidates gently try to outdo each other in opposing federal taxes and spending the lowimpact campaign has served mainly to dim the chances of outsider candidates who had to excite the electorate to have any chance that is especially true for two republicans , representative joe l barton and richard fisher , a banker and onetime adviser to ross perot mr barton has campaigned heavily on his opposition to homosexuals' serving in the armed forces everyone knows it s crazy to force soldiers to sleep in bunks with homosexuals , his television advertisements proclaim mr fisher says he is an outsider , the only candidate who has n't sold out to the special interests , as his advertisements put it he pays for his campaign out of his own deep pockets , but his boast that he was the only one in the race not to take money from political action committees sparked what might have been the high moment of the barton campaign in a debate , the congressman from ennis shot back that mr fisher was also the only one of them who had ever given money to a pac lacking perot s twang mr fisher lacks the folksiness and twangy humor of mr perot , and his expensively produced television advertisements seem to have had little impact on voters mr krueger boasts that he cut his own pay and office expenses in his brief months in the senate , and he speaks of performance audits as a way to save federal money he assails his republican opponents for opposing the family leave act and accuses them of weak backing for other family oriented measures but mr krueger , a former dean at duke university , is a stiff campaigner who does not sound like a texas politician when he speaks , as he did this morning in san antonio , of integrity , or integritas in latin his greatest assets are backing from governor richards and those who want her favor like the unions , which dried up the financing of a potential challenger , former state attorney general jim mattox ms hutchison runs against washington , using advertisements that for some reason depict the senate judiciary committee as the enemy , while mr fields counters that with his experience in the house , he would be ready to help texas from day one ms hutchison s support for abortion rights and aid to russia sets her apart from the more conservative mr fields but as they barnstormed west texas wednesday , both candidates scorned new taxes , especially on energy , and any involvement by the united states in bosnia for the middle class ms hutchison s television commercials stress her work on women s issues when she served in the texas legislature and her goal of a future better for our sons and open for our daughters mr fields s advertisements emphasize his concern for the working middle class he inveighs against illegal aliens , saying if the federal government stopped paying them benefits , it could save 27 billion in five years but none of this talk has made any impact at all compared to the accusation by sharon ammann , a daughter of former gov john b connally , that ms hutchison hit her repeatedly with a book when she was slow to find a phone number for her two years ago , and required her to help supervise the decorating of ms hutchison s home here ms hutchison , who was elected to replace governor richards as state treasurer two years ago , flatly denies ever hitting ms ammann , and each has claimed to have passed a lie detector test ms hutchison says any work on her home was to be done on employees' own time mr fields , whom mr connally backs , never fails to say he did not make the accusations public , but on wednesday in abilene , he added , physical abuse in the workplace is absolutely wrong mr krueger said in san antonio that this was all a republican family feud but he said using state employees for personal business is a felony photos although he appears to be in the lead in tomorrow s senate primary , senator bob krueger of texas , left , may not win a majority , forcing a runoff in early june he will probably be facing either representative jack fields , center , or kay bailey

the body in question was edward plantagenet , prince of wales , slain in battle by richard iii rebekah slotnick , a senior in the drama department of adelphi university on long island , was having trouble , as edward s widow , dealing with the corpse would n't the natural reaction be one of revulsion at the cold flesh \? vanessa redgrave had a couple of suggestions the british actress , who was at adelphi on wednesday to read from the works of russian and soviet writers , had agreed to conduct a master class for the drama department in the school s olmsted theater after canvassing the students to see what pieces they had prepared , she settled on a shortened version of act i , scene 2 from richard iii , in which richard overcomes the loathing of lady anne and persuades her to accept his ring for the next two hours , she pushed , pulled and picked at the scene , challenging her two actors to justify every intonation , every change of mood , every physical movement , with one goal in mind , to convince the audience beyond a reasonable doubt that richard wins over lady anne remember , she does take that ring , ms redgrave said we have to answer that question , why \? and at the end , we have to think , 'my god , i would have done that too' corpse is a problem the immediate problem was the corpse as an experiment , ms redgrave had altered the text and told ms slotnick to imagine that the body on the floor was edward rather than henry vi , his father , also killed by richard at the battle of tewkesbury for the scene to work , anne , although mourning henry s death , must also communicate the grief she feels for her husband ms redgrave circled the recumbent edward like a police detective confronted by some baffling evidence she suggested to ms slotnick that she bend close to her husband , grasp one of his hands and speak to him talk to him so that only he can hear you , if he could hear , she said talk to him so that whatever you say goes into the ground with him she returned to her place in the front row , lighted a cigarette and leaned forward , chin in hand , staring intently enter the hunchbacked richard , stage left , with limp as ms slotnick turned to face him , ms redgrave , called a halt to the scene excuse me , but how did you know it was him \? she asked ms slotnick paused and said i recognize the body the front four rows of the university s theater , filled with drama students , burst out laughing an actor s conviction turning to james anthony , playing richard , ms redgrave proposed another experiment it was vital that richard explain away his foul crimes to lady anne with absolute conviction ms redgrave asked mr anthony to face the audience and , in his own words , convince them that his murders were completely justified acting as prosecuting attorney , she peppered him with questions , exposing the weaknesses in his argument , forcing him , like richard , to lie brazenly for much of the two hours , ms redgrave , speaking very slowly and carefully , coaxed her actors to work from their own experience to establish an emotional connection with the characters at the same time , in a series of short history lessons , she tried to explain that the characters were operating in a different world , impelled by motives that might seem alien to a 20thcentury audience it does n't get us very far to say , 'what if i were in that situation , ' because it s so far from ours , she said the hideousness of richard , for example , seemed to be a stumbling block for the students how could anyone so repellent hope to woo and win lady anne \? just because he has a hunchback and a limp , is there anything in the text to suggest that you might not find him terrifically attractive \? ms redgrave asked ms slotnick , who replied that a young woman would find the deformity frightening but he s got a whole lot going for him , has n't he \? said ms redgrave the admiration of a prince counts for something you as anne are not growing up in a world in which people choose whom they marry it s a dangerous world , where if someone high up likes you , in whatever way , you 're going to be safer than if he does n't like you her voice darkened remember , your husband , who was your guarantee that you would live to the age of 60 , has been killed by someone stronger imagine that your chance of leaving this theater , of eating with your family and enjoying yourself tonight lies with richard he is the only one who can let that happen or prevent it how about taking that as your 'if' \? as the class wound down , ms redgrave asked ms slotnick and mr anthony to comment on the scene she invited the corpse of edward to share his thoughts as well ms slotnick said that she now felt the dual attraction to both her husband and richard mr anthony said he found the scene much more erotic with the body present there was more gameplaying , he said he s dead , but he still has what i want then ms redgrave let the audience in on a little secret in none of the productions of richard iii she had seen , she said and i 've seen some very good ones had she been convinced by the scene that ms slotnick and mr anthony had struggled with for two hours the experience , ms slotnick agreed , was a bit like a workout with a particularly demanding personal trainer but in this case , she said , the trainer was arnold schwarzenegger photo vanessa redgrave working on wednesday on a scene from richard iii with vincent minutella , left , rebekah slotnick and mark walcott , on floor , drama students at adelphi university on long island \( vic delucia the new york times \)

an open letter to bartenders by now , you have probably read that the miller brewing company is introducing a clear beer this week and by now , all those headscratching questions about what makes a beer clear and why on earth a customer would want one are probably growing bothersome the questions are no longer so pressing for most of you , since miller said yesterday that it was introducing the beer only in austin , tex , minneapolis and richmond to see how it plays it may be months before it comes to a distributor near you or it may never make it beyond those test markets but for those of you who like to plan ahead , we now have handy facts and selling strategies , courtesy of miller executives and cliff freeman partners , the agency handed the challenge of advertising the new beer here are some talking points to make you sound like a savvy barkeep it turns out that miller did not set out to make a clear beer rather , it was a byproduct of the brewer s goal to create what consumers told miller they wanted , namely , a fullflavored beer with none of the harshness and heaviness of many beers while tinkering with several recipes , miller happened upon a filtration process that takes out a lot of the carbohydrates and , with them , the color \( all of which improves the beer s socalled drinkability , the brewer says , which must make it the right choice with chips that boast good snackability , as fritolay executives are wont to say \) the fact that miller clear fits neatly into all the talk about new age beverages is purely coincidental , according to miller executives dry beer s downfall did somebody say the characteristics of clear beer sound awfully similar to dry beer \? give that man a miller while sales of dry beer have indeed fallen in recent years , miller officials say the oblique marketing message typified by bud dry s why ask why \? campaign was to blame , not the product itself consumers never understood what 'dry' meant , jerry schmutte , miller s director of new products , said yesterday at a news conference at cliff freeman in manhattan still , it seems likely that the notion of clear beer may cause a few synapses to misfire in the minds of beer drinkers in fact , consumers in millersponsored focus groups had different reactions to the beer when it was served to them in an ambercolored glass and then in a clear glass it s such a mindblower , mr freeman said to advertise the unique product , miller executives said they had recruited mr freeman s agency for its creative track record , which includes the enormously popular campaign for little caesars pizza like much of mr freeman s work , the teaser campaign for miller that will run for the next three weeks in test markets is a chuckler in the teaser spot , several quirky miller brewmeisters squirm as they prepare to unveil miller clear to several equally quirky miller executives a quick cutaway to a panel of hooting and armtwirling beer drinkers signals that people who have tried the beer like it when a brown bag is lifted off the beer , each executive s panicstricken face is shown fullframe to make such a drinkable beer , we did just one little thing , says the tagline in the teaser ad the ad that will reveal the clear beer , starting april 19 , also introduces the tagline , great beerdrinking beer hammering on the word beer in the tagline is necessary to fulfill the goals of the ad campaign , which are to insure people understand that miller clear is a beer with impeccable beer credentials , rather than a clear malt beverage like the coors fledgling zima brand so great beerdrinking beer makes the point , you say \? but what if somebody in your bar decides to take issue , arguing that a great beerdrinking beer is a truism of sorts , not unlike volkswagen s saying in recent ads that its new eurovan is the world s largest van for its size \? a possible retort since when is the beverage industry beholden to logic \? photo miller s clear beer will invite comparison with the more familiar brew , when it is introduced in three test markets this week \( cliff freeman partners \) \( pg d19 \)
washington , may 20 the first serious challenge to president clinton s tax plan springs mostly out of an odd sort of no man s land between the two major parties , a wilderness where philosophies overlap and the residents have adapted to political survival without outside help it appears to be an exceedingly small place senator david l boren of oklahoma is a fiscal conservative among the democrats , who have embraced the president s plan for a record tax increase and a raft of bold and costly new federal programs senator john c danforth of missouri is a fiscal liberal , as republicans go , in a party that has forsworn any increase in taxes , however dire the nation s budgetary straits mutually aghast over the ballooning federal deficit but in shock over mr clinton s plans to deal with it , mr boren and mr danforth spent the last week scouring the senate for likeminded lawmakers who would break ranks with their parties and endorse an alternative tax plan in the end , they found only two william s cohen , a maine republican , and j bennett johnston , a louisiana democrat this is a group that gathered because of a sincere feeling that the president s package was lopsided on taxes and did n't have enough spending cuts , said senator john h chafee of rhode island , a danforthstyle republican who flirted with joining them but elected this morning not to i have to commend anyone who s courageous enough to propose a solution pivotal political battle courageous , certainly , for they are defying their white house or republican leaders in what is shaping up as the year s pivotal political battle at least five others senators , all deficit hawks who want deeper cuts in the budget , flirted with the borendanforth cabal , but demurred for political or ideological reasons they included democrats like sam nunn of georgia and kent conrad of north dakota and republicans like rhode island s john chafee but only fools rush in , and none of these senators are fools their bravery is fortified by the security of a rocksolid senate seat , the predominance of homestate opinion , the prospect of substantial political gain , or all three republicans are at somewhat less political risk because their votes are not needed to enact mr clinton s plan and no republican is less encumbered by political pressures than mr danforth , who has said he will retire next year to return to private legal practice or the priesthood but none has been more outspoken about the threat posed by the deficit , either danforth has warned about the danger of the deficit since the mid80 s , said one lobbyist who knows him well he s never worried about the politics he just believes you ought to roll up your sleeves , do something and the heck with the consequences the other republican , mr cohen , shares mr danforth s fiscal leanings and mr boren s bent for independence befitting a state that gave ross perot one of his strongest showings in last november s election , mr cohen is one of the senate s least partisan republicans he also is a close friend of mr boren , having served as vice chairman of the senate intelligence committee when he headed the panel in the last term of congress never a strong republican , mr cohen risks little by advocating the same sort of deficit reduction that perot supporters would logically favor blessed with safe seat but senator boren , in particular , is taking a leap that friends say is rooted in principle but could produce big political gains he is the swing vote on the finance committee , the senate panel through which mr clinton s taxandspending package must pass before reaching a final vote a senator since 1978 and governor of oklahoma before that , the 52yearold mr boren is blessed with one of the safest seats in the senate and with that , has the ability to take on political tasks that might daunt less popular politicians for example , he is the chief sponsor of senate legislation to overhaul campaignspending laws , a proposal many lawmakers enthusiastically favor in principle but would just as soon forget in private on campaign finance and many other issues , senator boren has worked to shape his own natural conservatism as much as possible to fit the clinton administration s policies like the president , he is a yale graduate and a rhodes scholar but he broke ranks with mr clinton on fiscal issues early this year and with his latest protest , mr boren is staking out a position as a democratic pinch penny , a stand that could prove valuable if the president falters opposed stimulus plan in march , mr boren was one of two senate democrats who publicly opposed mr clinton s proposal to spend 19 billion on an emergency package of jobs and public works projects , asserting that the president was raising the deficit before he cut the first cent from the federal budget the white house scoffed , but the senator proved prescient democratic leaders were never able to generate enough public support for the president s economic stimulus bill to break a republican filibuster that eventually killed it outright in some other democrats' view , senator boren and senator john b breaux of louisiana , another conservative democrat , are the politicians who made opposition to the president a credible alternative when they spoke out against the economic stimulus package this spring and in the view of some senate republicans , it is mr boren who is again making it conceivable even respectable to think of altering mr clinton s tax plan , long after both houses of congress had approved it in concept mr johnston s motivations appear somewhat less lofty than mr boren s mr johnston has a reputation as one of the quietest and most adroit political tacticians in congress he is a relentless advocate of louisiana s interests , and is chairman of the senate energy and natural resources committee , where policies affecting louisiana s petroleum industry are cast neither mr johnston nor his junior colleague from louisiana , mr breaux , like the white house proposal to levy a tax on energy , and mr johnston s decision to join mr boren seems based as much on the prospect of changing that tax as on his concern about deficits indeed , senate aides say mr johnston did not join mr boren s bandwagon until late wednesday after his protege , mr breaux , elected not to publicly oppose the president
five masked men staged an armed robbery on a metronorth commuter train last night , robbing four passengers and escaping , a metronorth spokesman said early this morning brandishing handguns and firing a shot into the floor , the thieves got in , grabbed the passengers' belongings and got out of the northbound train in less than the approximately two minutes it would normally spend in the station , glenwood station in yonkers , said the spokesman , dan brucker none of the passengers was hurt in the incident , which occurred about 10 15 pm , mr brucker said it was apparently the first time a metronorth train has ever been robbed by theives as it stopped in a station , he said one passenger said he could not believe what he was seeing as the masked men boarded the last car of the train and demanded that several women sitting close to the door hand over their purses i moved out of the city because i was afraid of things like this , said the passenger , who spoke only on the condition of anonymity i thought this would only happen on the subway the witness said the five men had worn black capes , and said one of capes got caught in the train door as it closed , before he shook free he said the robbers struck at the last car the train and escaped up a stairway off the platform that is positioned right where the last car of the train stops wore masks mr brucker said the metronorth police could not confirm that the five men wore black capes , but he said they were dressed in dark clothes and wore ski masks the metronorth police , who interviewed the passengers who were robbed as well as several other witnesses , estimated that the robbers were between 17 and 20 years old , were all male and were between 5 foot 8 and 6 foot 2 , mr brucker said two of the robbers had guns , and at least one shot was fired , he said , and the metronorth police found the bullet lodged in the floor of the train the robbers apparently escaped just after the train doors closed , but a conductor who heard the gunshot came back to the rear car to investigate , and he called the police before continuing the train on up the hudson line it was delayed nearly an hour , the witness said i did n't know whether to duck under my seat in case there was trouble , or to sit up and stare , because i 'd never seen anything like this before , said the passenger
sarajevo , bosnia and herzegovina , aug 6 a day after pledging to relax markedly the serbian nationalist siege of sarajevo , the serbian military commander appeared to hedge today , raising doubts among top united nations officers whether the withdrawals will be made promptly , or indeed at all at a meeting with united nations commanders at sarajevo airport , the serbian military commander , lieut gen ratko mladic , left serious questions as to whether the bosnian serbian nationalists would pull their forces back from two strategic mountains southwest of sarajevo and open up two roads to the city nato decision on air strikes the pledge was made on thursday in an apparent reaction to a renewed threat of military intervention by the nato allies nato has scheduled a meeting for monday to decide whether to give the goahead for air strikes to relieve the strangulation of sarajevo in washington , administration officials said the united states would give united nations commanders a veto in choosing targets for any nato air strikes page 4 a plainly disappointed gen francis briquemont , the belgian who commands united nations forces here , left sarajevo airport after nearly six hours of talks with general mladic and the bosnian government s military commander , gen rasim delic , saying no progress had been made on carrying out the serbian pledge to withdraw from strategic locations on mount igman and mount bjelasnica , two peaks that were part of a crucial supply line for sarajevo mount bjelasnica fell to an assault by serbian forces on sunday , and serbian troops were threatening to overrun mount igman , below mount bjelasnica , when nato announced on tuesday that it would begin preparing detailed plans for bombing attacks against serbian positions general briquemont made it clear that the airport meeting had failed because of serbian attempts to limit the powers of the united nations military observers who , in the withdrawal plan announced on thursday , were to have moved into the areas evacuated by serbian troops to make sure that bosnian forces did not reoccupy them we cannot achieve a military solution for mount igman and mount bjelasnica because we have not the same concept of monitoring and control , general briquemont said after the meeting how plan was drawn one reason for the apparent hedging by general mladic may have been that the plan to withdraw his forces was not drawn up by serbian political and military leaders , but by general briquemont and his staff when the plan was announced at the serbian headquarters in pale , southeast of sarajevo , it was presented as a serbian move but the top civilian official in the united nations administration in bosnia , viktor andreyev , told reporters today that the plan had been drawn up by the united nations commanders and put to the serbian leaders as a way of stopping nato bombing attacks the plan devised also committed the serbian leaders to reconnect water , electricity and gas lines to sarajevo and other besieged towns , a move that would amount to abandoning one of the most powerful siege weapons , other than artillery bombardments , that the serbian forces have used serbian leaders also agreed to reopen two key roads connecting sarajevo to the adriatic coast and to central bosnia that have been blocked since the start of the 16month war as part of the serbian effort to starve the predominantly muslim populations of the besieged areas in drawing up the proposals , the united nations commanders were following a policy that has guided them from the outset of their deployments here this policy , in effect that of the european governments that have provided most of the troops for the 9 , 000man united nations force , has been to concentrate on trying to get food and other essential supplies to besieged muslim communities , and to do so by cooperating with the serbian forces , not by confronting them at a news conference today , general briquemont implicitly criticized president clinton and american officers for pressing the airstrike plan when it comes to making threats , it is easier to speak than to act , general briquemont said the main problem with threats by people outside of bosnia and herzegovina and i wo n't say that they have taken their decision lightly is that they give the impression of being people studying the situation on maps in a headquarters , while i have to study the real situation on the ground when they speak of threats , they should come to sarajevo and study the maps with me the opposition of the united states' nato partners to military intervention here has been crucial to the pattern of the war by heading off the united states on at least one previous occasion , when mr clinton proposed air strikes against the serbian forces in april , the european nations have in effect signaled to the serbian leaders that they can continue their offensives without fear of western intervention serbian commanders , keenly aware of the differences between the united states and its european allies , have taken to saying openly how much they admire the realism of european leaders , especially prime minister john major of britain , who has been a strong opponent of air strikes , and how little regard they have for the inexperienced and naive mr clinton another part of the united nations strategy to undercut the drive for air strikes is a refocusing of its efforts to getting relief supplies through

man in boston , mr redstone never intended a business career after graduating from harvard in less than three years , he was part of the team that broke japanese military codes during world war ii after attending harvard law school , he ultimately chose business i went into law to make the world better , he recalled i found out early that law was just another business if i was in business , at least i would make money mr redstone joined his brother in the mid1950 s , running their father s drivein theaters but by the 1970 s the pair were not getting along and mr redstone began developing his own theater circuit , pioneering the concept that theaters should be sophisticated , to differentiate them from television he bought the land on which he built his theaters , thus creating his first fortune by the early 1980 s , mr redstone already was worried that home video and cable would damage the movie theater business as he saw it , programming crucial to any distributor from a theater owner to a cable operator would prosper the result his 1987 purchase of viacom , a deal in which mr redstone basically brushed aside the investment bankers and did much of the negotiating himself over all , viacom has done extremely well mr redstone has taken its core businesses overseas , making the mtv and nickelodeon channels household words abroad but there have been problems , too , as the television production business languished he and martin s davis , chairman and chief executive of paramount , said yesterday they were driven toward the merger as they became convinced that the future of their companies was in expanding control over software in the fierce battle over programming , mr redstone was reportedly angered recently when telecommunications inc , headed by john c malone , got the paytelevision rights to universal pictures films from showtime for mr malone s own paytelevision service owning paramount will help give mr redstone the leverage to avoid such rivalries advantages of merger mr redstone already was talking yesterday about the advantages of a merger two weeks ago paramount agreed to pay viacom 800 , 000 for book rights to 'beavis and butthead , ' the mtv show , mr redstone recalled it was scheduled to be a warner bros movie now paramount will make it what is not clear is just how he and mr davis , or the executives at paramount pictures , whoever they ultimately are , will get along some find it hard to imagine mr redstone can stay out of the creative side of the business but at viacom , at least , mr redstone has managed to keep existing management , including frank j biondi jr , the chief executive , despite reports that their relationship went through some difficult periods because of mr redstone s strong role within the company no imminent changes for the moment , there are no imminent changes none of mr redstone s children are directly involved at viacom , though he has hopes that one daughter , who is showing increasing interest in the business , will play a stronger role even if no family members come into the business , there is little chance the company will be sold my stock is set up in trust in such a way that it is impossible for it to be disposed of , mr redstone said we have plans so that the taxes can be paid without a stock sale you may ask me why , and i ca n't tell you why he said that he had been happy with the management that he had hired and hoped matters would continue that way but he never forgets that he is the owner yesterday morning , in front of the sherman sterling law offices , an employee came up to remind him that a meeting was about to start he said quietly but very , very firmly , i do n't think they are going to start without me , and went right on talking

to the editor beyond whatever shortterm military intervention is feasible and appropriate in the former yugoslavia , and beyond war crimes prosecution for a few identifiable individuals , a third international strategy can shift the geopolitical balance back toward peace tangible and effective pressures can be imposed more broadly on aggressive actors in the serbcroatbosnian setting by explicitly tying future recognition of state borders to international norms of behavior consider a thread in reports of some observers from the bosnian theater in recent months there have been many instances of violence visited upon representatives of the united nations and the international committee of the red cross by various combatants , but apparently none against representatives of the european community \( many have been present in the region \) in the balkans one often sees the european community flag 12 gold stars circled on a blue backdrop displayed with a wistful starinwaiting in the corner , representing hopes for entry into the european economic federation acceptance into the european family represents each incipient state s best hope for the future the possibility of being barred from that acceptance is very sobering there thus could be a dramatic impact on the balkan wars if the world community , and the european community in particular , declared directly and unambiguously that there will be a form of potential state accountability that no nationstate will be accepted as a full member of the community of nations , or of the european community and the council of europe , so long as its claimed borders were established through a process involving proven war crimes in the current conflict this strategy would give special importance to the independent commission set up by the security council to investigate war crimes in the bosnian theater the economic future of these societies in transition can in this way be held hostage to the behavior of their representatives in the war zones irregulars , as well as official military units , group actions where individuals cannot be identified , as well as where individuals can be held responsible , and not just for the time that the conflict goes on , but also for future negotiations when the guns have gone silent as the european players and the clinton administration consider the problematic military options and the possibility of a handful of individual prosecutions , they would also do well to consider such a broader accountability strategy this approach would apply more effective suasions and deterrence upon those warring populations , and not coincidentally serve to reinforce the international rule of law zygmunt plater prof , boston college law school newton centre , mass , jan 5 , 1993
to the travel editor before it is summer again in europe , i am writing this letter to warn other travelers daylight time begins in europe one week before the united states , something i did not know one year ago last march we took our children to venice and on a tour of the veneto on the last night we stayed near the milan airport we arrived at malpensa airport two and a half hours early in our rented car to take delta flight 85 departing at 11 55 am my husband dropped off my daughter and me with the luggage to check in he and our son went off to refill the gas tank my daughter and i then stood to the side waiting at 10 20 a delta employee asked where the rest of my party was my watch said we still had an hour and a half until departure but the employee said daylight time had begun the night before in europe and the plane would close its doors in 20 minutes no one anywhere had ever mentioned european daylight time the plane left on time even though the four of us were by then standing at the delta counter with 15 minutes to go , delta would not let us board delta personnel were unsympathetic and one employee pointed to where other airlines were if we were to get home that day we then had to purchase tickets on the spot on alitalia , which cost 1 , 250 apiece , to arrive home in time for work and school i wrote to delta , and got nothing more than a very sincere apology we were offered us the return portion of our four delta tickets , 784 , but the line did not acknowledge any responsibility for our being out of pocket 4 , 216 i checked with several travel agencies and none of them acknowledged having such information in their computers susan schlechter new york , ny

to the editor in atom smasher is super nonsense \( oped june 17 \) , john lukacs attacks not only the supercollider in texas , but also the enterprise of particle physics one can debate how scarce public funds should be spent on research , but this nonsensical article shows a shocking ignorance and a dangerous antiscience bias mr lukacs argues that physicists are deluding themselves when they perform experiments because they create the situations that are being studied and therefore are inextricably part of the observation if you boil water in a pot , you are creating a situation that would not exist if you did not turn on the gas does this prevent you from sticking a thermometer into the water and accurately measuring the temperature \? is the measurement meaningless \? of course not , so mr lukacs invokes the muchabused and illunderstood quantum uncertainty principle to inform the unwitting scientific community that physical law itself intertwines the observer with the observation the uncertainty principle does tell us that it is impossible simultaneously to measure certain quantities but in no way is quantum physics imprecise or muddleheaded quantum physics is the basis of chemistry and solidstate physics , the cornerstone of the electronics revolution that has changed our lives medical tools such as xrays and scans use elementary particles , which obey quantum laws , as probes if mr lukacs were to have a condition diagnosed by such a device , would he doubt the validity of the findings \? particle physicists make up unusual and playful names for new particles but these have nothing to do with the precise measurable properties that distinguish particles it is because particles have quantifiable properties that the names are finally irrelevant the argument that modern particle physics has returned to the medieval superstitition of nominalism is fatuous and cannot be used seriously against the supercollider mr lukacs mockingly compares modern particle physics to an experiment conducted in the middle ages to ascertain how much a person s soul weighs by comparing his body weight before and after execution this is gratuitous and insulting particle physics is a great intellectual triumph , and we should be proud of it theory and experiment are in excellent agreement , but much is unknown , and future experiment is crucial to making further progress we should champion the struggle to know the workings of nature mr lukacs offers no alternative to our outmoded methods of inquiry because he has none should we accept what he sees as limitations in our ability to understand the universe \? would he have offered this advice to newton or einstein \? would he have told galileo to consider the possibility that 100 or 200 years hence people may laugh at the pretensions of some of our scientists \? the supercollider will open a new window on an energy range not yet explored by physicists it must be built if progress is to proceed components of the supercollider are being constructed , tunnels are being dug , and young physicists like myself and my colleagues are planning to explore the new scientific frontiers it is in our country s best interest to complete this project , and i urge congress to go along with the president and continue funds to assure us of a future in this fundamental area of science edward farhi professor of physics , mit cambridge , mass , june 18 , 1993 drawing
cleveland i just met maybe the only person in america who does n't know who michael jordan is , said the visitor as his host opened the door of a hotel suite here sunday afternoon you did \? said the genuinely curious host , a basketball player for the chicago bulls named michael jordan who s that \? ran into a couple in the lobby , said the visitor it was abba eban and his wife he was in town to make a speech i told him i was here to see michael jordan i asked if he 'd heard of you , and he said he has but his wife said , 'who s michael jordan \? ' jordan smiled that s good , he said they wo n't be after me for anything by the way , who s abba eban \? aha ! in life , one learns that one way or another , things always even out jordan , who would later be interested in hearing about the star israeli diplomat , had other concerns at that moment he was watching the telecast of the knickshornets playoff game and his rooting interest showed a certain ambivalence while he openly seemed to want charlotte to win this game and tie the series at 22 the better , surely , to help wear both teams down he was n't that crazy about the hornets winning the series after all , with the bulls up three games to none against the cavaliers , it was a good bet that chicago would advance , as it did last night , and play one of those two teams if we play charlotte , he said , i'm in hot water with tickets jordan was raised in north carolina , and went to the university of north carolina would the knicks be a bigger challenge \? my challenge , he said , is only to win a third straight championship as the knicks began to squander a 15point lead , spectator jordan , in sweat shirt , jogging pants and redandwhite sneakers , squirmed on the couch i ca n't believe they 're letting the hornets back in the game he shouted at kendall gill , whose shooting had been off go to the hole ! gill took a jumper that missed youth ! when larry johnson celebrated after the hornets closed the deficit to 2 points , jordan said too soon to do all that jumping up and down you lose energy you need that high emotion for later in the game that s inexperience the knicks are n't like that anymore , said jordan and a lot of that has to do with patrick , and with doc rivers patrick ewing took a shot that hung , hung on the rim , then fell in that s amazing , man what touch ! said jordan and he s doing everything he can to win like he s getting better position so he does n't go out on fouls as often but one of the biggest things is how he kicks the ball out when he s double and tripleteamed before , he thought he had to do it all himself now he has confidence in starks and blackman and rivers to hit the outside shot doc especially has helped settle down the younger guys and anthony \? not my favorite guy it s one thing for a guy to come in the league and try to assert himself , but you ca n't antagonize people to the point of violence look , look there , said jordan the hornets have trouble shooting from outside because of the knick defense look how close the knick defenders are they do n't give you a foundation jordan was particularly impressed with pat riley s handling of the rookie hubert davis he did n't let him die on the bench and hubert shoots just like his uncle that is , walter davis , like hubert and jordan a former tar heel walter was my idol a great jump shot , and hubert is a carbon copy anthony mason took a strong rebound he s one of the most valuable players very versatile i did n't realize how good he was until this year he and oakley together they 'll beat you for the offensive rebound jordan said he also likes starks very much he s a guy who has bounced around in the cba , and this league , and now he has stepped up he takes the responsibility when patrick goes out but if patrick gets tired , and starks is n't hitting they 're in trouble on charles smith he s been disappointing because they want him to be a tough guy , and he s a finesse player when blackman hit the final basket , jordan exclaimed that s a veteran ! under pressure , he was n't going to be rushed but where was the defense \? inexperience and jordan s view of a knicksbulls series \? after our last game in new york , when they beat us , he said , i saw spike lee at courtside and said , 'you think the knicks are going to win this year , do n't you \?

washington , july 23 surgeon generaldesignate joycelyn elders , under attack by many conservatives for her outspoken advocacy of condom distribution in high schools , early sex education and government financing of abortion , underwent a bumpy senate confirmation hearing today but seemed to weather it well her performance , before the senate labor and human resources committee , was such that democrats were bolstered in their confidence that the questions raised last week about a number of her past financial dealings would not block the road to confirmation the hearing was concluded in just one day , at the end of which the committee s chairman , senator edward m kennedy , democrat of massachusetts , praised dr elders for her forthrightness and scheduled a vote on her nomination for next friday morning a vote by the full senate is expected before a monthlong recess begins in early august after the hearing , senator daniel r coats , an indiana republican who has been dr elders s most persistent critic among the committee s members , said he was still not satisfied and had not yet decided which way to vote my questions were not fully answered , he said , and my deepest concerns were only reinforced comparisons to koop but a number of republicans , as well as the democratic majority , praised the nominee s plain talk , and both sides drew comparisons between her and c everett koop , president ronald reagan s appointee as surgeon general , who was also outspoken , was also frequently criticized and is now widely admired dr elders , a pediatrician whom bill clinton appointed director of the arkansas health department in 1987 , when he was governor , parried repeated questions about her finances and firmly defended herself on a matter that had been raised as an issue only in recent days her decision on one occasion not to announce that a batch of condoms distributed by the state to public health clinics had later proved to be substandard by day s end , this was the issue on which mr coats questioned her most closely the episode occurred in 1991 , when the health department received four complaints that the condoms were breaking the department notified the federal food and drug administration , and subsequent testing by that agency showed that the suspect batch broke at the rate of 50 per 1 , 000 condoms when under strain the fda s safetystandard maximum is 4 per 1 , 000 dr elders ordered a recall of the condoms from arkansas clinics but , she said today , some had already been distributed by the clinics to the public she said her staff had decided , and she had concurred , that no public announcement should be made very few of the condoms got out , she said we felt making an announcement would be creating a major scare that would make everyone afraid to use condoms mr coats pressed her , asking whether as a mother she would not be angry if she learned that the health department had declined to inform her that condoms that might be defective had been distributed to her daughter the decisions you make as a mother , as a citizen and as a public health official are sometimes different , dr elders replied we made a decision for the greater public good do you still believe that was the right decision \? mr coats asked yes , i do , she said questions on finances many of the responses that dr elders gave to questions about her financial affairs were familiar , having been offered by either herself or her supporters during the last week she acknowledged that for six years , social security taxes had not been paid for a nurse caring for her husband s mother , now 97 , who suffers from alzheimer s disease but she said that her husband had taken charge of all financial matters involving his mother and that she had not been aware until two weeks ago that any taxes were owed all those taxes , amounting to 15 , 000 , have now been paid , she said on the issue of whether she had been double dipping in recent months by continuing to receive her salary as arkansas health director while also receiving more than 500 a day from the federal government in preparation for her new job , she explained that the money paid her by arkansas was for vacation time she had accumulated she said she had been willing to take a leave without pay but had been required by the state to take all the vacation days due her first questions had also been raised about her role as a director of the national bank of arkansas directorship of the bank changed hands in a takeover by a group of dissident shareholders in 1989 , and the new directors later sued the previous ones , including dr elders , for mismanagement the suit was settled earlier this year , without public disclosure of the terms but a lawyer for the plaintiffs told the washington post last week that dr elders had been sued only in her representative capacity as a director and that there were no allegations of personal wrongdoing against her individually the office of the comptroller of the currency did issue letters of reprimand to all members of the ousted board for failure to keep a closer watch on the bank s managers , who had made improper loans but dr elders testified today that none of her own specific actions or decisions had been cited in the letter to her and that she had not been a subject of further inquiry substance and style dr elders , 59 , a sharecropper s daughter who grew up in poverty , has long been an advocate of the poor and a proponent of helping to break poverty s cycle by eliminating unwanted pregnancies as health director in arkansas , she promoted school health clinics that , with the approval of local boards , distributed condoms to students advocated sex education for children as young as kindergartners supported governmentfinanced abortions , and called for free distribution of norplant , a surgically implanted birthcontrol device , among prostitutes her position on such issues has outraged conservative groups like the christian coalition and the family research council but it is not only what dr elders says that has made her a subject of criticism it is also the way she says it her opponents describe her as combative and divisive today three republican senators mr coats , nancy landon kassebaum of kansas and dave durenberger of minnesota read a number of quotations attributed to her over the years and asked whether they were accurate one was that prolifers are very religious but nonchristian dr elders replied that she had made such a remark about some groups that are against health education and against welfare and against medicare they always want the children to be born , she said , but they do n't want to support them when they are born she also acknowledged having said that we teach teenagers what to do in the front seats of cars , and now should teach them what to do in the back seats what she meant , she explained , was that driver s education is standard in many schools but that we do not teach children to be responsible about sexuality we all want abstinence , she said and if i knew how to get abstinence , i would do whatever it takes to do that but as a mother , she said , given a choice between hearing my daughter say 'i'm pregnant' or 'i used a condom , ' most mothers would get up in the middle of the night and buy them herself photo surgeon generaldesignate joycelyn elders , left , appearing before the senate labor and human resources committee for her confirmation hearing senator carol moseleybraun of illinois , right , introduced her \( paul hosefros the new york times \)
jerusalem , sept 9 enemies to the death for three decades , israel and the palestine liberation organization opened a new era in their bloodsoaked history today by recognizing each other s legitimacy and the rights of both to represent their people s dreams yasir arafat , the plo chairman , said in a letter to prime minister yitzhak rabin that his group recognized israel s right to exist in peace and security , renounced the use of terrorism and other acts of violence , and was ready to discipline any of its loyalists who break this pledge and in a separate letter to norway s foreign minister , who had served for months as an intermediary in secret talks between the two sides , mr arafat called on palestinians in the israelioccupied west bank and gaza strip to begin the normalization of life israeli officials took that as an arafat appeal to end the palestinian uprising known in arabic as the intifada , although that was not spelled out rabin stood firm the israelis said mr rabin was adamant that the intifada be curtailed it was a measure of mr arafat s determination to reach an agreement that he yielded on this point even though most palestinians in the territories consider the uprising an indispensable tool to resist the israeli occupation for his part , mr rabin wrote a terse letter to mr arafat saying that in light of these palestinian commitments , his government has decided to recognize the plo as the representative of the palestinian people and to commence negotiations with the plo within the middle east peace process unlike mr arafat , who closed his letter with the word sincerely , mr rabin dispensed with such pleasantries and simply put his name texts of the three letters , page a12 mr arafat signed his letter to mr rabin behind closed doors late tonight in tunis , where the plo is based when mr rabin follows suit at a signing ceremony in jerusalem on friday morning , it will clear the way for yet another agreement on a plan to transfer authority in the territories from israeli to palestinian hands , starting with a form of selfrule in gaza and the west bank city of jericho breathtaking change that accord , the product of months of secret negotiations conducted mainly in norway , is to be signed at the white house on monday by highranking officials on each side no names have been announced , but the israelis said they would probably be represented by foreign minister shimon peres , and the palestinians are expected to send mahmoud abbas , the plo official who supervised the negotiations farouk kaddoumi , the plo foreign minister , opposed the agreements washington has been the locale of the most recent middle east peace talks , and both sides seem to want united states involvement in the peace process no amount of protocol or formal language , however , could obscure the breathtaking change that has now swept across this land for which jews and arabs have fought and died across the last century for israel , recognition of the plo , formally endorsed by the rabin cabinet this evening , means that it is prepared at last to come to terms with a detested arab leader whose followers have taken countless israeli lives and whose name is uttered by many jews in the same breath as hitler s for the plo , it means that it has come at last to accept that israel is here to stay and that this fact will not be altered by killings , resistance or its 1964 covenant calling for armed struggle to destroy the zionist and imperialist presence in rejecting that part of the covenant now , mr arafat acknowledges that if he is to obtain the state he hopes to lead in a few years , he must settle for the territories of gaza and the west bank and he is not about to liberate all the land that used to be called palestine the leap that has been made is so large that the normally phlegmatic mr rabin told members of his labor party today that he had butterflies in my stomach coming to terms it does not mean that he likes dealing with the plo , he said , and aides added that none of this means the prime minister puts his trust in mr arafat but if there is to be peace with the palestinians , the only negotiating partner available is the plo , mr rabin asserted you do n't make peace with friends , he said you make it with very unsavory enemies mr peres , who guided the secret talks in norway and who met with a senior plo official in oslo last month , spoke more positively about the shift that has taken place , insisting that the government had remained true to longstanding principles and to its commitment to israeli security we have n't changed it changed , he said , referring to the plo arafat is announcing that he opposes terrorism and will fight the terrorists he recognizes israel and its right to exist in peace from clinton , praise on a visit to cleveland , president clinton added his endorsement , saying after a phone conversation with mr rabin , this is a very brave and courageous thing that has been done
washington , feb 6 the new ethos of washington is supposed to be shared sacrifice , but constituent groups are already mounting preemptive defenses probably none will be as formidable as social security recipients selling sacrifice to the elderly , and the politicians who represent them , may be the first crucial test of president clinton s deficitreduction plan what was widely seen as an administration trial balloon a proposal for a oneyear freeze in social security costofliving increases has landed with a thud on capitol hill president clinton was bluntly told by democratic senators that such a measure would exact an enormous political cost , perhaps even democratic control of the senate , democrats on capitol hill say in the house , early partisan skirmishing saw republicans rising happily to the defense of a program that they were often accused of trying to plunder during the reaganbush years social security is unequivocally the one contract the country is overwhelmingly in favor of , said representative newt gingrich of georgia , the republican whip i'm going to do everything i can to keep the democrats from tampering with it recalling the elections of the 1980 s when democrats campaigned on the simple slogan , save social security , vote democratic , mr gingrich added , tip o'neill must think these folks have lost their minds turning up the pressure the groups that lobby for retirees in washington are talking of jammed switchboards , mass mailings , 800 number hotlines , and of sacrifice unfairly apportioned these entitlement programs like social security did not cause the deficit and therefore should not be used to resolve it , said martha mcsteen , a former social security commissioner who now heads the national committee to preserve social security and medicare despite ms mcsteen s remarks , retirement benefits account for about a fourth of the federal budget , and many in the administration and congress agree that cutting the deficit will be impossible if those benefits are left untouched the american association of retired persons , which was holding its annual legislative meeting in washington this week , sought and heard reassurances from an array of congressional and administration leaders that their concerns were understood i am a duespaying , discountseeking member of the aarp , declared senator barbara a mikulski , the maryland democrat who heads the subcommittee on aging of the senate labor and human resources committee you did n't create the deficit , and i do n't know why they look at you all the time to correct the deficit who will be unscathed \? but even as the retirees' lobby kicks into gear , and a freeze in benefits seems less likely , there is also a widespread recognition that it will be hard for any big group to emerge unscathed from the coming round of cuts and taxes this is particularly true for the elderly , whose programs accounted for 283 percent of all federal outlays in 1990 , according to the house ways and means committee by contrast , programs benefiting children accounted for 52 percent , according to the house panel as a result , opponents of a benefits freeze are looking on another administration proposal as a fallback position raising the amount of social security benefits subject to taxation for higherincome retirees that s a perfectly legitimate subject to talk about , senator daniel patrick moynihan , the new york democrat who is chairman of the senate finance committee and a furious opponent of a benefits freeze , said in an interview on friday some on capitol hiil even saw the mention of a possible freeze in costofliving adjustments as an early softeningup strategy to make the tax increase more attractive an analysis released this weekend by families usa , a washington advocacy group , said that nearly half of the money raised from a freeze would come from beneficiaries with incomes below 20 , 000 and an additional 33 percent from beneficiaries with incomes of 20 , 000 to 40 , 000 cutting the social security cola socks it to the poorest of our grandparents , said ron pollack , executive director of the lobbying group tax increase is proposed the other proposal being circulated would raise taxes on benefits under current law , 50 percent of social security benefits are subject to income tax for retired individuals whose annual income exceeds 25 , 000 and for couples whose income exceeds 32 , 000 raising that percentage to 85 is one possibility under discussion the analysis from families usa said that 84 percent of the revenues raised from that proposal would come from beneficiaries with incomes over 40 , 000 a year it s a way of asking sacrifice from those who can afford it , mr pollack said still , no one underestimates the difficulty in making any adjustments affecting the social security program , which is known on capitol hill as the third rail of american politics , ready to deliver a lethal shock to the politician who touches it it is one of the great success stories of american government , a program credited with largely eliminating poverty among the elderly it is also seen as an almost sacred covenant between the populace and the government because , as a former social security commissioner , robert ball , put it , you get the benefits because of the work you do political 'holy writ'
london , may 4 a judge today stepped up the investigation into britain s sales of armsmaking equipment to iraq in the years before the persian gulf war , opening public hearings to determine if officials knowingly violated their own ban on military exports to president saddam hussein lord justice scott , a high court judge who was appointed by prime minister john major in november to conduct a wideranging inquiry into the sales , is expected to hear testimony in coming months from mr major and his predecessor , margaret thatcher , who led the government for more than 11 years until late 1990 the first witness today was sir richard luce , who was a minister in the foreign office in the early and mid1980 s he described the development of britain s policy of banning the export of materials to iraq or iran that could enhance the military capabilities of either country , which were then at war with each other the policy was publicly disclosed in 1985 by sir geoffrey howe , who was then the foreign secretary under mrs thatcher policy is questioned the government s adherence to the policy came into question last fall after the collapse of the trial of three executives of churchill matrix , a british company that had supplied iraq with machinery in the late 1980 s that could be used in weapons making prosecutors dropped the case after a former defense minister , alan clark , admitted that the sales had been approved by government ministers who knew of the military implications publicly , the government never changed its policy , and as late as 1990 , after iraq invaded kuwait , ministers told parliament that the export ban remained in effect under pressure to explain the apparent discrepancies after the collapse of the churchill matrix case , mr major gave lord justice scott broad authority to conduct an independent inquiry into any armsrelated exports to iraq the investigation team has already amassed 80 , 000 pages of government and private documents and may hold closeddoor sessions to deal with matters considered secret by the government the inquiry is expected to last at least until late this year last month lord justice scott , in an attempt to insure what he called a full and frank examination of britain s armstrade policies , said none of the testimony to his inquiry would be used in any criminal prosecutions that might arise no officials have been charged in the case conduct of officials studied the inquiry will also consider if a number of current government ministers acted improperly during the churchill matrix trial , including michael heseltine , the trade and industry minister malcom rifkind , the defense minister kenneth clarke , the home secretary , and tristan gareljones , a top official in the foreign office they signed orders seeking to keep secret , on the grounds of national security , government documents that could have bolstered the defense contention that the company s exports had been approved by the government the officials have all said they acted properly and on the attorney general s advice mr major , who served in a number of positions in mrs thatcher s cabinet before becoming prime minister , has denied that he sought any coverup of the government s actions or that he was aware of the approval of the exports lady thatcher has not spoken publicly about the case , but has said she is willing to testify according to government documents assembled by defense lawyers in the churchill matrix case , officials were aware of the military applications of the exports by the company , but approved the sales to help british machinetools sales and as a means of gathering intelligence on iraq

it s something i believe strongly in , and we work very hard at being selective , he said , adding that every one of his players graduates within five years also , the academic talents transfer to the basketball court when it comes to commitment i 've told the players that if you 're no 5 in the country but losing in the classroom , you 're not being consistent as a coach , i'm also well aware that if you do n't win a lot of games , no matter how bright your kids , you 're going to get fired photo uconn s rebecca lobo , top left , and jennifer rizzotti cheer on their team during practice pam weber goes up for a basket \( carl david labianca for the new york times \)
portauprince , haiti , july 9 the economic data pieced together here by foreign experts in recent weeks read like those of a country emerging from a devastating war unemployment of more than 40 percent , uncontrolled inflation and a poverty line cutting off 70 percent or more of the population but even these figures do not give a full picture of the damage wrought not by armed conflict , but by nearly two years of political strife and mismanagement as well as international sanctions intended to help force the restoration of democracy after a coup by the haitian military in september 1991 already the poorest country in the hemisphere before the overthrow of its first democratically elected president , the rev jeanbertrand aristide , haiti has been turned into an economic wasteland whose resurrection , experts say , will require hundreds of millions in aid and years of the kind of determined and judicious management that haiti has rarely experienced in the past the settlement signed a week ago by father aristide and the haitian military commander has lent momentum to international plans for economic aid , which revolve around creating 75 , 000 or more jobs in the country in the first year after father aristide s scheduled return to office on oct 30 many of those jobs will involve unskilled labor in basic public works projects in neglected areas like sanitation and road repair us pledges 375 million in its first year , the aid program will require more than 170 million from international donors the united states recently pledged 375 million , and is expected to give more over the longer term , experts say their hope is not just to put money in empty pockets , but to build a new haitian economy the damage to haiti s existing economy is visible everywhere at an industrial park on the edge of the capital that blossomed in the 1980 s to become the country s largest foreign exchange earner , only silence emanates from row after row of the hangarlike buildings where clothing was stitched and electronic components were soldered a few years ago on downtown streets that once bustled with vendors and chaotic traffic , cars are few and the trade is gone my father died because i could n't buy him medicine now i ca n't feed my children because there is no more business , said marceline dukens , a produce vendor who has been trying to save up enough money for car fare to reach her village please give me something so that i can take my family out of town thousands leave capital her appeal is a common one these days with inflation running over 60 percent and business virtually dead , thousands of people have left the capital in recent months in the hope of eking out a subsistence in the countryside , where farming and barter have mostly replaced commerce the most immediate explanation for haiti s current suffering is an international oil embargo imposed only last month by the united nations although it forced the army to accept a political accord providing for father aristide s return , it has also had a crushing effect on almost everyone the flow of electricity in the capital , which depends on oil , is now down to less than 12 hours a day in most areas under a strict rationing program , cars lining up at gas stations snake around city blocks or , as is often the case where discipline breaks down , turn entire streets into helterskelter parking lots we will be lucky if our factory can make it through the end of next week , said a producer of fertilizers of the effect of the oil embargo he requested anonymity so as not to scare off foreign customers but if the oil sanctions are the most visible symbol of the country s woes , they are perhaps the most easily settled they are to be lifted once haiti s parliament purges lawmakers who were elected in a fraudulent vote in january and then ratifies father aristide s choice of a new prime minister economy in stagnation what you have is an economy that has been in stagnation since 1987 , said alberto favilla , an economist and former world bank official who has led efforts to put together an international recovery package for haiti virtually every sector has suffered severe damage , from agriculture and export industry to infrastructure government has done nothing to take care of the country , not so much as maintain roads or irrigation canals at the root of the economic crisis , economists say , is a sharply divided class system in haiti that allows the wealthy few to thrive almost regardless of the plight of the rest of the population the elite relies on rigged markets to preserve longstanding monopolies , the lack of tax collection and an institutionalized corruption that allows big importers to bring their goods into the country without paying duties or even standard port fees haiti has what you could call a franchise economy , where members of the elite have carved out their own niches and in effect employ the government and the army to protect their holdings , said one expert on the haitian economy , speaking on condition that he not be identified the system , which has evolved over decades , is so entrenched that ordinary public services , from schools and hospitals to fire stations and drinking water , have never been created for the general population experts involved in planning the aid package for haiti say it will seek not only to create new economic activity quickly and ease suffering , but also to redress the imbalances in the hope of creating a more stable and just political climate what we are talking about is making a viable country where there was none before , said a diplomat who has been closely involved in the aid planning that means not only shortterm aid , but longer term things like helping rebuild government ministries and developing haitian expertise as prospects of father aristide s return to power have improved in recent months , diplomats say , so has the involvement of the president s aides in shaping policy decisions and economic planning in ways they hope will allow the program to get off the ground quickly miami meeting planned father aristide , a populist priest viewed by many in the haitian elite as an enemy , has been reaching out to some of the country s most conservative business leaders , inviting many of them to a meeting planned in miami later this month aimed at allaying their fears the president wants to tell them that he wants to work with them , not go after them , said robert malval , a businessman who is expected to be father aristide s choice for prime minister if we are going to rebuild this country , the president has said that everyone who rejects crime and corruption will have a place photo already the poorest

to the editor in california s experiment on your schools \( oped , oct 30 \) , jonathan schorr says there s no proof that vouchers work , so let s not try them yet there s ample proof that public schools are not working for many of the families who are paying taxes to have children educated by them perhaps mr schorr is relying on a recent report by the economic policy institute , which asserts that school choice does not help students nor create more equity for racial minorities this is from the same group that gave us the twisted calculation that the united states spends less on education than every other industrialized country save sweden this report again skews the facts school choice programs in nearly a dozen states are made up of large numbers of lowincome , minority children in wellintegrated settings both public and private schools in which choice is exercised demonstrate not only higher achievement in academic subjects , but also a decline in dropouts , a higher average daily attendance rate , high morale , a drop in disciplinary action or none at all and greater retention of teachers in every experiment where a child has transferred from a public to a private school , that child is now graded against a higher standard in milwaukee , home of the first example of a publicly funded school choice plan , public schools are discouraged from holding back students who show up at least half the time and are able to muster at least a d in all subjects conversely , most of the private schools in the choice program in milwaukee base grades on tests , effort and the demonstration of knowledge it will take some time before children coming out of the public school system can show on paper what they have achieved there are other benefits less tangible than test scores many of the people in california who voted for the school choice initiative that was defeated nov 2 are worried about crime in the schools they 're worried that their children are n't learning enough to land a job that requires more than seventhgrade skills they 're worried about public schools with minorities segregated in bad schools away from the mainstream in the end vouchers will give the poorest of students the choice not only to attend quality private schools , but to benefit from an improved public school system as well because a system responsive to parents will create a dynamic for improvement in all schools jeanne allen president , center for education reform washington , nov 4 , 1993 drawing
when the word went out among the good people of occupied copenhagen that the germans were preparing to round up their jewish neighbors , jorgen kieler was a 23yearold medical student working with the resistance in the space of two days , he and his friends helped organize 13 fishing boats , our little fleet , that carried more than 800 jews to sweden and safety jorgen kieler went on to have his skull fractured during an interrogation , to spend time in two concentration camps and eventually to become director of the danish cancer research institute last night the jewish foundation for christian rescuers honored him , his sister and the other danes who saw to it that all but a few hundred jews escaped the germans it could not , said dr kieler , have been otherwise how simple it is to recognize the right thing in retrospect how difficult it can be at the time many americans want to do the right thing in bosnia , but many are plenty confused about what the right thing might be perhaps a small group of women reflect the larger issues that plague us they are rape counselors , from st vincent s and st luke sroosevelt hospitals in new york and rape victim advocates in chicago , who have formed the balkan rape crisis response team four of them went to zagreb and split to train medical personnel to deal with survivors of the war crime that has become the central horror of this war they went with preconceived notions based on their experience and training but in the words of one , meghan kennedy , they discovered they had to take off the white coats some of what they had to offer was useful , some simply beside the point because of the severity of the trauma and the conflict we had to become humble , said ms kennedy we had to say , 'take what we offer that is useful and forget the rest' she and the others became aware of how much of the international relief effort was well meant but ill conceived some groups were interested in data collection were you raped \? they would ask a woman how many times \? by how many different men \? one clinic had a sign over a doorway rape victims and women were urged to tell their stories over and over again to reporters , even if the telling was traumatic good intentions , bad execution that is what some fear about military intervention as well many americans say they still do not fully understand the conflict or what we could possibly do to resolve it and it is true that internecine conflicts are excruciatingly difficult , whether we threaten air strikes , commit ground troops or join a united nations force but some old lessons are invaluable elie wiesel , devoted always to the eternal flame of memory , turned to the president at the dedication of the holocaust museum and said i have been in the former yugoslavia last fall i cannot sleep since what i have seen as a jew , i am saying that we must do something to stop the bloodshed in that country public television aired a documentary to coincide with the dedication memory of the camps includes endless footage of the attenuated , pale limbs and blank eyes of corpses as well as some of the burgermeisters from nearby towns , taking it all in they shrugged their shoulders and beat their brows and tried to say it had been none of their business , the narrator intoned mankind was my business , the ghost of jacob marley tells scrooge to save him from perdition george bush gave the american people perhaps a halfdozen reasons for going to war in the persian gulf bill clinton has only one in bosnia he must have a clear mission , a clear plan but first the president must state both the simplest and most powerful of motivations stopping the slaughter , foiling genocide is the right thing you can say why us \? and i can tell you what dr kieler said when he was preparing to be honored as a rescuer of men , women and children who might have lived truncated lives and died horrible deaths had not one young man with a comfortable existence and a sure future risked both i would like to end by telling you this , he said we were rescuers , but we were rescued , too the americans , they were our rescuers so thank you , america
st charles , ill , may 23 rival poll takers in last fall s election agree that bill clinton was elected because of the faltering economy , but they find no similar consensus about what mandate the american people expect him to fulfill in office stan greenberg , mr clinton s poll taker , told the american association for public opinion research here on friday that the president s main difficulty with the public now was that he s not breaking gridlock , the expectation when he was elected the most important thing is for him to have successes , mr greenberg said fred steeper , head of market strategies of ann arbor , mich , who was president george bush s poll taker , said president clinton s difficulties were not in the intractability of washington but in his policy choices he s going back on his mandate to do something about the economy , in particular the deficit , mr steeper said the contrasting conclusions were each based on vast amounts of election polling mr steeper said that in 1992 he conducted 11 national polls , 56 state polls and 54 focus groups , along with 7 , 000 continuous polling interviews in october alone mr greenberg said that from june to labor day he did one national poll a week , increasing it to three a week by october focus groups were done twice a week until labor day , and twice a night thereafter different uses of polling the two poll takers gave different accounts of how their clients used polling early in their terms as president , as distinguished from their campaigns mr greenberg said he conducted monthly polls , met daily with political advisers and was at the white house every day i do meet on a regular basis with the president , he said mr steeper said , only a couple of times in the first two years did we make a formal presentation at the white house he said that the bush white house had no one thinking full time about political strategy and that only three national polls were conducted in all of 1989 each scoffed at the use of polls as a basis for decisions on foreign policy asked how many questions he had asked about policy concerning bosnia , mr greenberg replied , none mr steeper said no request for polling on the persian gulf war was made by bush administration officials meeting at a resort hotel here at the association s 48th annual conference , the academic members of this group of poll takers , professors and market researchers were even less certain of the prescription the public wanted president clinton to fill , although they attributed his election to the nation s sense of a faltering economy diana c mutz , assistant professor of political science at the university of wisconsin , said in a paper presented saturday that mandates were historically forged in the aftermath of an election she said mr clinton had only a mandate for nonspecific change by the time of his election and had failed to move quickly to define one in its aftermath her paper was written with kathy cramer , a graduate student another presentation challenged the poll takers' reliance on the reasons that people give for their voting choices wendy m rahn , an assistant professor of political science at the university of wisconsin , said voters often do n't know why they support a candidate and feel embarrassed to cite the more emotional reasons they do have the result is often a rationalization , rather than a true explanation , she said some campaign insights mr greenberg and mr steeper also offered a variety of campaign insights the republican poll taker said mr bush s greatest early problem was not his abandonment in 1990 of the campaign promise he made two years earlier to oppose new taxes indeed , mr steeper argued , the public strongly favors tax increases combined with spending cuts , as last fall s budget agreement provided , over no deficit plan at all , which was the only real alternative in congress mr bush s problem , mr steeper said , was that 80 percent of the public said in the fall of 1991 that the country is in a recession right now the inflated approval ratings as a result of the gulf war early in 1991 were a disservice , mr steeper added , because they blinded the campaign to the economic issue for nearly a year both poll takers agreed that mr bush could have made more effective attacks on mr clinton over his support of letting homosexuals serve openly in the armed services and over his record as governor of arkansas when the bush campaign did turn to the arkansas issue in late october , mr greenberg said , it took an enormous amount of resolve and a lot of people to persuade the candidate not to respond , and to continue talking about change , especially in welfare
trenton , aug 21 from the earthy , pipesmoking congresswoman millicent h fenwick to former gov thomas h kean , who traced his family wealth and political lineage to colonial times , politics has long been a popular calling for some of new jersey s wealthiest citizens and while their opponents occasionally took aim at their wealth or patrician backgrounds , the attacks seldom caused any lasting damage but against the grain of that tradition , wealth has become a central issue in this year s gubernatorial race between gov jim florio , a democrat , and his republican challenger , christine todd whitman , as mr florio has tried mightily to convince voters that his multimillionaire opponent is out of touch with them it s not a matter of how much money you have , said mr florio i suppose whether you are rich or poor you could still be out of touch with the people , and it is clear that she just does n't get it polls show that mr florio and mrs whitman are in a dead heat in the gubernatorial race , although no public polls have specifically addressed the question of her wealth moreover , none have been conducted in the last week as the debate swirled over mrs whitman s rural estate and the agricultural tax breaks she received a smaller target a growing chorus of republican voices has encouraged mrs whitman to go on the attack against mr florio over tax increases , the state s economy and ethical questions about his administration , warning that every day she delays , she runs the risk of having mr florio and his chief political strategist , james carville , define her as a candidate but mrs whitman s strategy has been to ignore the florio attacks and to continue on the stump , frequently outside the view of the media , to provide as small a political target as possible for mr florio if he were to run on his record , he would be pretty defensive throughout this campaign , said mrs whitman , the first woman candidate for governor in new jersey under a major party banner that mr florio , and mrs whitman s republican primary rivals before him , would try to turn her wealth into an issue is hardly new to new jersey politics political opponents of both mrs fenwick and mr kean tried to use similar strategies , but to no avail mrs whitman has not been as fortunate , experts say , largely because she lacks the political track record and is not as well known as her patrician predecessors experts say the experiences of mrs whitman and politicians like mr kean reflect the conflicting public attitudes about wealthy candidates on the one hand there is a sort of envy , and on the other hand there s the idea that the wealthy ca n't be bought , said stephen a salmore , a republican consultant and a political science professor at rutgers university wealthy representation both united states senators from new jersey are millionaires bill bradley , a former star in the national basketball association , and frank r lautenberg , who made a fortune as head of automatic data processing , a company that processes the paychecks of 1 out of every 14 nongovernment workers in the nation but wealth has never been a political issue for either of the senators , both of whom are democrats in fact , mr lautenberg spent 5 million of his own money in his 1988 campaign , without suffering politically , as he defeated pete dawkins , a republican multimillionaire mrs fenwick , daughter of ogden h hammond , a financier and state legislator , grew up in a 50room mansion in bernardsville , nj but by the time she won her first seat in the state legislature in 1970 , at the age of 59 , and went on to congress five years later , she had worked as a fashion model , an author and an editor and spent decades in public service with such a background , mrs fenwick , who died last year , was molded into a colorful personality whose character transcended wealth her idiosyncrasies made her nearly a cult figure and inspired the lacey davenport character in garry trudeau s doonesbury cartoons kean s success but mr kean had to work a bit harder in his first run for the republican gubernatorial nomination in 1981 , an early challenge was to overcome the image of a blue blood , even though he had already served 10 years in the state assembly mr kean s ancestors include the 17thcentury governor of new amsterdam , peter stuyvesant , and new jersey s first constitutional governor his father , the late robert winthrop kean , served in the united states house of representatives from 1939 to 1959 , and his family s ownership of vast tracts of real estate and elizabethtown water company , one of the state s largest utilities , made him one of the richest politicians in the state during the primary , one of mr kean s three challengers , joseph a \( bo \) sullivan , tried to portray him as out of touch with common folk , using a political ad that said , this is n't the kind of guy who would buy you a beer in bayonne , a workingclass community in northern new jersey mr kean won a convincing primary victory and then , before his democratic opponent , jim florio , could use the issue against him , he took the political

if we do n't get the chance , it would hurt her the most , said sur , who has never competed in the olympics that puts our case separate from other athletes meanwhile , roca and sur s skating routine , like sterling silver , must be regularly polished they will participate , along with such stars as brian boitano and nancy kerrigan at the att proam today and tomorrow in philadelphia sur is 26 , roca is 30 their partnership is an improbable story borne of cold war politics and unintended circumstance in late january 1990 , sur had just completed a monthlong tour of the united states with ice dancers jayne torvill and christopher dean and a troupe called the russian allstars the russians had come to new york for three days before returning to moscow , sur s hometown for two weeks , sur and four friends had talked quietly of staying behind he wanted to become a coach , and there seemed to be more opportunities here , just as there was more freedom and sur had grown tired of kgb whispers that he should play i spy on his fellow skaters if i turned them down too many times , i would be considered untrustful , and it was possible that i would n't be allowed to travel , sur said new jersey rendezvous with no underground railroad to freedom , sur settled on the new jersey turnpike there were panicked phone calls , threats from the russian tour manager , a latenight meeting with the fbi in a motel outside the lincoln tunnel sur and another russian ice dancer , yelena krykanova , requested political asylum and filled out the paperwork of escape the next morning , they moved in with russian immigrants in brooklyn , joined by two more russian skaters and a tour official eventually , the five defectors pooled their money , rented a onebedroom apartment and furnished it with street smarts the immigrants told us when garbage day was , and we found whatever people threw out , sur said after a month , his money supply exhausted , sur began sizing up his job prospects what kind of job would accommodate the peculiar skills of limited english and expert ice dancing \? dishwashing , he decided quickly and none too happily a career of nimble feet was about to descend into one of dishpan hands just in time , american friends put sur in touch with the detroit skating club , which offered a coaching job and housing , and with roca , who had won the 1986 national championship in dance like sur , roca had a career in eclipse more importantly , she had an answering machine sur left a message , roca called back they had met briefly at a skating competition in 1988 sur flirted , roca ignored him no wonder all of his best lines were in russian she said she remembered me , sur recalled i do n't know roca had a men s costume that belonged to a former partner it fit , sur said almost what did fit perfectly was their dance style , one that evokes passion and desire , a skating intimacy , contrary to most american dancers who prefer broadway on ice with glitzy show tunes they are favored to win a second united states championship in january , but their most important marks will come from congress , not figureskating judges i think the best team should go to the olympics , sur said but if we do n't , life wo n't stop
attitudes toward the classicalmusic canon have been changing over the last two decades the art music world , it has increasingly been noted , is dominated by a handful of dead white men , mostly dead white german men despite the supposed sophistication of late20thcentury scholars , musicians and listeners , most have , over the years , willingly yielded to a kind of dehumidifier principle of fame , which sucks all the subtle moisture out of history the famous become ever more famous , because they are relentlessly performed and anthologized , while those just below vanish into the abyss there are two classes , the canonized and the disappeared , with almost nothing in between no phenomenon better illustrates the pleasures and woes of this superhero approach to music than the humble bust on the piano composer busts are concrete but at the same time ideal in their idealism , in fact , they are sometimes almost interchangeable i have a composer bust with an especially aquiline nose it is all of shiny white porcelain , and about six inches tall from its wavy hair to the bottom of the square base block gilt letters spell out the composer s name mozart it s a beautiful bust , and there is only one thing wrong with it it is almost surely a likeness of chopin in an age in which a drop of michael jordan s sweat encased in plastic would probably bring an easy four figures , it is comforting to recall that our taste for memorabilia is nothing new at once an icon and a decoration for a piece of parlor furniture , the composer bust is also a reminder of an obsession with biography , monuments and tchotchkes that dates back almost two centuries to the china factories of dresden , potsdam and berlin , and the mania for toy soldiers as a neoclassic idealization of a grecoroman phenomenon , busts connect the humble spaces on the surface of the piano with the ancient glorification of statesmen , aristocrats and demigods mozart \( chopin \? \) was none of these , and it was only in a world where the love of art had replaced religion as a solemn form of absolute worship that the musical bust was massproduced the sheer number of composer busts is staggering , as is the number of styles and types there are lifesize ones \( some people keep beethovens in their gardens like gnomes \) and others smaller than a child s hand \( there is a tiny rachmaninoff bust that looks like dan rather \) busts come on round pedestals , square pedestals , wooden pedestals and no pedestals they are of porcelain , marble , plastic , wood and even stucco \( a good substance for beethoven , since it approximates his pockmarked complexion as we know it \) most are silent , but some sing bach plays jesu , joy of man s desiring beethoven chirps fur elise in terms of sheer numbers , beethoven , mozart and bach lead the pack you can find them almost anywhere , but to find a lifelike bust of verdi you may have to go to italy , and the midsize bronze smetana that decorates my piano came from an antique store in prague while mozart might turn up in either norway or hungary , the odds of locating bartok in oslo are similar to those of finding grieg in budapest it goes without saying that composer busts are exclusively male i 've never seen a bust of a female composer it may also be worth noting that despite the enormous reverence audiences have for performers , performer busts have never really made it as a retail item \( although i once rented an apartment that had a toscaninihead ice bucket on the piano \) composer busts proliferated in conjunction with the rise of the piano as a piece of domestic furniture needing decoration every bourgeois household had its keyboard in lieu of altarpiece , and bust makers must have quickly realized that their product had a perfect space but these little household gods caught on for other reasons as well though music is central to the spiritual lives of many citizens , it is impossible to touch , ineffable and ultimately indescribable this intangibility may explain why music , more than any other art , offers so many biographical moments as part of its history the lives of beethoven and mozart have become like fairy tales , and music is often taught to children through a wide range of stories that forge connections between an ideal of pure sound and external reality busts , then , are not only piano decorations they are yet another way of mediating between the abstract realm of musical space and the real world , a difficult task indeed they do not represent the composers themselves , but rather our idealized notions about them this sense that we intuitively understand busts as proxies may explain why my massproduced mozart bust was never recalled or even noticed the proliferation of composer busts in the latter half of the 19th century also symbolized a change in attitude toward music in the first part of the century , music was transformed into a concrete thing , a commodity , like the bust itself previously it had been a largely functional substance , to be danced , marched and sung to , spoken over and eaten with but by the 1830 s and 40 s , music was no longer seen as simply something to accompany activity it was the activity and its makers were no longer craftsmen they were themselves godlike artists audiences began to worship the creators , to exalt them , to see them as semidivine the busts made in the 19th century , almost invariably larger and more beautiful than those of today , reflected this worshipfulness in 1840 , josef dannhauser painted his famous canvas of liszt playing for an imaginary audience of rossini , dumas pere , paganini , victor hugo and marie d'agoult , all in a state of rapt attention the upper righthand corner of the painting is dominated by a roman bust of beethoven , which sits on the edge of the piano placed near the open window and shining with celestial light , it represents the very essence of the godlike creator , connecting nature and humanity , life and art that grand image , part glory and even then part kitsch , has been replaced today by the caricature titan on schroeder s piano , the massculture beethoven who , like a victorian child , is seen and not really heard the composer busts of today , often featuring the most halfhearted craftsmanship , are a parody of the great western tradition , and similarly set in stone \( or plastic , as the case may be \) as the parlor piano is replaced by an elaborate variety of electronic and computerized gewgaws , it is likely that busts will disappear , lacking their appropriate perch one wonders whether the great tradition will survive their passing on the bright side , though , there are indications that we are in the midst of a revolution that will boldly resurrect works and composers outside the canon a valiant new passion for obscurity might be just the tonic the bust industry needs i would certainly love to see a bust of the noted 13thcentury theorist anonymous iv of course , it would probably look just like mozart photo composer busts are sometimes almost interchangeable in their idealism the mozart figurine in the foreground is a beautiful likeness of chopin \( jim wilson the new york times \)
washington , july 28 in contrast to white house assertions that there had been no signs of trouble , vincent w foster jr , the longtime friend of president clinton who apparently committed suicide last week , had displayed signs of depression in the final month of his life , according to federal officials and people close to mr foster mr foster , the deputy white house counsel , had been so depressed about his job that before his death he had spent parts of several weekends working reclusively at home in bed with the shades drawn , a close associate said today the 48yearold lawyer had also told at least one doctor that he was dispirited and had obtained the names of at least two washington psychiatrists , federal officials and associates of mr foster said a family doctor in little rock , ark , sent antidepressant medication to mr foster the medication arrived in the final days of mr foster s life , but he apparently had only just begun to take it , said a person close to the family this person said that mr foster s wife , lisa , recalled after her husband s death that when he would try to smile it was a forced , hollowedout kind of expression in addition , the white house said tonight that torn pieces of paper found monday in the bottom of mr foster s briefcase in the white house contained what appeared to be notes to himself that indicated a troubled state of mind the notes were on what had been a single sheet of yellow legalsize paper , the white house spokeswoman , dee dee myers , said tonight , and indicated that mr foster was upset about work ms myers cautioned that while the notes , pasted together by investigators , appeared to have been written by mr foster , their authenticity had not been determined she said investigators had not planned to disclose the existence of the notes until they had been verified instead , she said , cbs news reported their discovery tonight and the white house then confirmed the report ms myers declined to characterize the discovery as a suicide note but said it shed some light on his state of mind a new picture the new information about mr foster s mental state shows that at least some of those nearest him had been concerned about his psychological health associate attorney general webster l hubbell and his wife , suzanne , traveled with the fosters to a maryland resort on the final weekend of mr foster s life on a trip specifically intended to cheer up mr foster , the associate said in sharing an account given by mrs foster that picture is different from the one presented immediately after mr foster s death and in the days that followed white house officials said then that there was no indication that mr foster had suffered from anything more than ordinary ups and downs it was unclear how widely mr foster s troubles had been known at the white house or whether anything he had done or said could have foreshadowed his apparent suicide mr foster died on july 20 in a roadside park along the potomac river several hours after leaving his white house office he had been shot once in the head president clinton acknowledged today for the first time that some associates of mr foster had been aware that he was quite distressed but the president said he was not really aware of that even the night before mr foster died , when mr clinton talked to mr foster for 20 minutes by telephone the white house said on tuesday that mr clinton had called mr foster in part because he knew his friend was having a rough time at work but the president said today that he had simply wanted mr foster to join him and other friends in watching a movie and that their conversation had focused mainly on work the two men agreed to meet in two days , mr clinton said the president did not provide any details of the distress that others had observed in mr foster neither did he say who he believed had been aware of that trouble a white house official who worked closely with mr foster said tonight that she had seen him at work in the white house on at least one weekend this month and that he had attended a pool party on another sunday she said she did not believe that he had been reclusive in any way travel office affair it was unclear when the additional details about mr foster s mental state became known to the white house federal officials said today that a piece of paper with the names of at least two psychiatrists had been found among mr foster s possessions , but white house officials insisted that they had learned of the discovery only late last night the piece of paper is not the one found torn up in the briefcase the person close to the foster family disclosed that mrs foster said after her husband s death that he had been emotionally worn down by criticism of his office and by concern that he would be reprimanded for his role in calling for an investigation of the white house travel office according to this account , even when mr foster was ultimately not criticized in an internal white house review of the travel office affair , he took it hard because a longtime friend , william h kennedy 3d , the no 3 white house counsel , was among those faulted in the dismissals of the travel staff while many mysteries remain in connection with mr foster s death , his symptoms of depression and his apparent efforts to seek treatment for it have made investigators and friends increasingly certain that he indeed took his life something snapped' sgt gregory brown , a spokesman for the united states park police , said today that investigators had found nothing to indicate that mr foster s death was other than a suicide something snapped and he went out and sought a nice quiet place at fort marcy , and that was it , sergeant brown said federal officials said there was no indication that mr foster had visited either of the psychiatrists named on the paper they also said they had no idea how or when he obtained the world war iera 38caliber colt revolver with which he was killed investigators said they had not been able to piece together how mr foster spent the time between 1 pm , when he left work , and 6 pm , when an anonymous caller telephoned the police about finding a body in a virginia park a report of the autopsy conducted by a fairfax county , va , medical examiner has not been made public , federal officials said today , in part because final toxicology tests have not been analyzed but they said the autopsy left little doubt that mr foster had died from a single gunshot to the front of the head , leaving a wound not inconsistent with a suicide comparing notes the president and mr foster had been friends for 46 years on the afternoon after learning of mr foster s death , mr clinton said that none of us knew of anything that might have caused him to take his life in recent days , some white house officials have said that in comparing notes since mr foster s death they have recognized signs that he might have been troubled but none said they believed that his problem was much more serious than stress from working in a highpressure environment

garden city , li , dec 8 when the gunman emptied his first clip into passengers at the rear of the car and stopped to reload , kevin zaleskie , crouching in panic a few seats farther along , realized he had one small chance to flee before aim was taken at him as the stalker worked the aisle , shooting to the right , then to the left , as methodical as if he were taking tickets i got up to run , but the aisle was jammed with someone , mr zaleskie , a financial analyst for ibm , said today , recalling what he thought would be the violent ending of his life amid the most banal routine of commuting home i did n't think i was going to get out i was very panicky i ducked back down in the seat the guy was moving in my direction , shooting again a ticket and a gun the rampage by the gunman aboard the 5 33 evening commuter train from pennsylvania station had moved mr zaleskie and 80 other passengers in the third car from the easiest of lulling habits to an instantaneous scramble of terror and fear a man intent on murder who carefully paid for his ticket back in new york city was firing methodically with a 9millimeter pistol , a hallmark of modern america s pathology of violence and fear in three minutes of gunfire , he reduced the defenseless commuters in the third car to casualties on a onesided battlefield as the gunman was finally brought to ground , tackled by one brave passenger and pinned by two others as he sought to reload his pistol for a third 15shot rampage , david farrell joined a reinforcement group that came from hiding to grab his legs and arms we held on and the gunman said , 'oh god , what did i do \? what did i do \? i deserve whatever i get' one of the men who subdued him could be heard commanding again and again from within the bloody scrimmage stay where you are shut up shut up shut up passengers farther away in the train would not discover the carnage until well after the gunman was subdued and the first of his 25 victims limped or were carried onto the long island rail road platform one passenger , william a warshowsky , had scrambled for his life from the gunman s approach , leaped with a crowd into the darkness from the stopped train and ran all the way home , finally checking his body for wounds and celebrating his survival intact another passenger , margaret richards , was amazed even beyond the bloodied windows and three victims she saw slumped tightly together with head wounds , when she saw the gunman handcuffed later in a patrol car he was very calm no emotions showing everything fine , you know , 'dumdedum , ' she related , songlike and then someone came over from all the blood of the train and lost it and began shouting , 'how can he be sitting there so calm after everything he did \? ' in the moment after the gunman had been subdued , mr zaleskie had turned in his mind from the next likely victim to someone of immeasurable good fortune in a minute , he was taking off his necktie and began making a tourniquet for a woman bleeding nearby , delivered from the terrifying stalker the guy kept coming down the aisle with the gun , mr zaleskie related of the height of the carnage and i just put my briefcase in front of my face and hunched down with two other people in the seat , he said , describing something close to fearful resignation he walked past , still shooting and i did n't feel any bullets , the passenger continued in a very tight , very grateful monotone of recollection and survival at this point , more than a score of passengers were already cast about the car , wounded and bleeding , and the gunman tended his pistol , the second 15shot clip exhausted so he s reloading again and he was certainly going to keep shooting , mr zaleskie recalled but someone yells , 'grab him ! ' that was when one passenger tackled the gunman in the center of the car before he could get off another round and two more men piled onto him the killer was pinned in a seat in the blood and goresmeared third car of the train , which had come to a stop at the merillon avenue station , panic spreading in all directions a horror , said mr zaleskie of the scene inside the car , suddenly quiet after the outrageous siege an absolute horror , and lying around in the aisles and in the seats , you see these people you never quite got to know across years of commuting , he said , his tone tinged with wonder faces you recognize each day , but do n't really know and this horror has happened to them at the front of the car , mr warshowsky had got up to wait by the door as the train approached the station when he heard the pop of the 9millimeter gunfire and mistook it for something harmless , caps or fireworks a woman yelled , 'he s got a gun ! he s shooting people ! ' the passenger recalled , saying he was instantly moving in an adrenal blur , jumping down into a seat to hide as the bullets sprayed about the car i heard 15 shots , said the 26yearold purchasing department worker at the new york times the gunman was pressing the trigger every half second or so going side to side shooting people not rapid fire , but pressing the trigger steadily pop , pop , pop when he stopped to reload i made a run for the next car we were trampling each other i thought the guy was right at my back , said the new york city native , in his second year of suburban life
criminal and civil investigations have begun into the death of a 33yearold bronx woman who died during an abortion last friday the woman , guadalupe negron , died friday afternoon after her uterus was perforated during a secondtrimester abortion at the metro women s center in corona , queens an official familiar with the case , who spoke on condition on anonymity , said the abortion was performed by dr david benjamin , whose license to practice was suspended for three months in 1986 for medical misconduct richard piperno , a spokesman for district attorney richard a brown of queens , said that a criminal investigation into ms negron s death had begun but that no other information was available the new york state department of health will also investigate the death at the request of the medical examiner s office a previous suspension dr benjamin could not be reached for comment last night , and no one answered the phone at the clinic peter slocum , a health department spokesman , said that in 1985 the health department filed civil charges against a dr elyas von rouhi , who later changed his name to david benjamin , in connection with a series of cases in herkimer , ny dr von rouhi , who had practiced in new york since 1982 , was accused of gross negligence in a number of gynecological procedures , none of them abortions there were no deaths , but some people were pretty messed up , mr slocum said the health department used its emergency powers to suspend dr von rouhi s license before the hearing in the case , something officials resort to only half a dozen times a year , mr slocum said after the hearing , the health department recommended that dr von rouhi s license be revoked but the state board of regents , which at that time had final say in cases of medical misconduct , decided to suspend his license for three months instead similar cases rare by the time the case was over in 1986 , dr von rouhi had moved to bayside , queens last october , the department of health again brought proceedings against dr benjamin but because of a recent ruling by the new york court of appeals , medical misconduct cases are no longer public record , so mr slocum said he could not comment on the nature of the charges or where the case now stands according to a health department report on abortions , there were only 10 reports of perforated uteruses in 159 , 000 abortions done in 1990 mr slocum said such a perforation could be caused by use of instruments that got in too far and were used incompetently if treated aggressively and immediately , they do n't have to result in death , he said dr benjamin worked out of a private medical office , which does not have to comply with state regulations for abortion clinics such offices sometimes do not have appropriate emergency equipment or backup arrangements with a local hospital in case a procedure goes wrong , mr slocum said secondtrimester abortions which can be risky but are not illegal are often performed in private offices , he said
washington now that ruth bader ginsburg has become the second woman on the supreme court and sheila e widnall has become secretary of the air force the first female secretary of a military department is n't it time to select a woman as chairwoman of the joint chiefs of staff \? or at least to join the other five chiefs as a member of the club \? after all , women make up about 11 percent of the military , and there are 21 female generals and admirals on active duty besides , women are permitted to serve in every military role except ground combat gen colin l powell , chairman of the joint chiefs , completes his term on sept 30 the military services have presented president clinton with several candidates as his replacement while these officers represent the four branches of the armed forces and have a rich variety of experience , all are men the list , too limited , is out of step with the times traditionalists the military has more than its share will argue that none of the female generals and admirals on active duty is qualified by seniority or experience they will say that none has fourstar rank or have had battlefield commands but such critics ignore the real demands of the job and the backgrounds of many who have served on the joint chiefs of staff , yet have held neither fourstar rank nor have had battlefield commands perhaps they forget that women are prevented by law from commanding combat units moreover , traditionalists probably miss the unique perspective a woman could bring to the post the head of the joint chiefs is , of course , the principal military adviser to the president , secretary of defense and national security council he \( she \? \) does not command troops as adm william j crowe , a former chairman \( and a clinton campaign adviser \) , notes in his memoirs , it does n't matter what general powell knows about tanks but what he understands about civilian and military bureaucracies that makes him such an effective chairman admiral crowe admiringly calls colin powell a political general the general s expertise comes not from serving in the field but from attending war colleges and civilian universities , as well as from long experience in washington rear adm louise wilmont , recently named to command the philadelphia naval base and its 15 , 000 military and civilian employees , graduated with honors from the naval war college in a class that included the commandant of the marine corps , gen carl e mundy jr she has extensive experience in the office of the secretary of defense admiral wilmont is unusual but she is not unique in this respect \( as the accompanying table shows , at least one woman from each of the other services has similarly strong qualifications \) while it is true that the men mentioned for the post have more seniority and experience than these female flag officers , other presidents have not hesitated to pick lessexperienced officers for the joint chiefs gen earl wheeler , chairman from 1964 to 1970 , the longest tenure in that post , was primarily a staff officer with little battlefield experience even colin powell had never commanded a division , served only nine months as a corps commander and had never headed a major unified command adm arleigh burke , who served on the joint chiefs of staff for six years , was only a rear admiral when president dwight d eisenhower picked him as chief of naval operations in 1955 gen edwin meyer was a 49yearold threestar officer with fewer than 30 years of service when president jimmy carter chose him as army chief of staff in 1979 adm elmo zumwalt was also only 49 when named to head the navy in 1970 a woman would bring special experience to the military s top position an institution trying to grapple with such issues as sexual harassment and women in combat could profit from a leader who has walked through some of those minefields as admiral wilmont said on taking command of the philadelphia naval base , i am willing and able many other female generals and admirals could say the same thing table lists the name , rank , service , age , years , senior service school , washington experience , commands and current job of four female pentagon officers
to those who knew him , elliot lopez did not seem to be the sort of teenager likely to be seduced by the street code of easy money , short tempers and rapid retribution a star athlete with a ready smile , his goal was college and a way out of a south bronx neighborhood whose streetcorners were dotted with dozens of other young men who had long ago traded the promise of the future for the grim pickings of the present but there were times when it appeared that his perspective on the crazy life was more than that of an outsider he knew some wild people , recalled kent wargowsky , his track coach at morris high school , who remembered him being greeted on the street by swaggering young men with gold chains elliot was such a nice person , yet he knew who the bad people were , but not , like , stay away from them one person mr lopez knew was anthony casellas his sister was a friend of mr casellas s wife , lourdes flanked by his associates , mr casellas strode through the streets near east 161st street and tinton avenue , leading a loosely knit drug gang , neighbors and the police say 'tato' and 'ding ding' at some point no one seemed quite sure when elliot joined his crew they grew close on the street , elliot lopez and anthony casellas were known as tato and dingding and last week they were arrested and charged with being the gunmen who lined six people up , face down , in a mott haven apartment on st valentine s day and killed them with single shots to the head the motive , the police say , was to avenge mr casellas s bruised honor after his wife had been beaten up last summer in a fight stemming from a longrunning feud last wednesday , the authorities say , the revenge came full circle at the entrance to the bronx county building , when lourdes casellas was fatally shot by a friend of one of the mott haven victims to the people who know mr lopez , the disquieting thought is how he could have had anything to do with the violent revenge in part , the two contrasted sharply neatly dressed and respectful , mr lopez avoided running with any one clique he was eventempered , puzzled by the violence around him he had finished high school and had been accepted to baruch college , although he never enrolled but people in the neighborhood were n't even sure if mr casellas had finished junior high school , and they remembered his predilection for the funky , baggy clothes the high fashion of the street and how his temper was best left unprovoked thomas rinaldi , mr lopez s 11th grade english teacher , remembered elliot as one of several students who seemed to be on the fence they were at that point where they were going to make a decision , he said temptations were presenting themselves friendly to everyone he was a gregarious , cando type who got along with everybody that was no small accomplishment in a place where the orbits of adolescent cliques curtail easy interaction his home life , according to his teachers and a few neighbohrood acquaintances , was mixed his mother and stepfather were quiet , hardworking people who lived with his siblings in an apartment on the 11th floor of the mckinley houses , a bronx project but his two brothers had had scrapes with the law and jail , his teachers recalled a woman who answered the door at the family s apartment said their lawyer had advised them not to comment his stepfather , a former professional heavyweight boxer , works in contruction , said the owner of a grocery store across the street mr lopez s teachers said he was a jokester in high school , he started a small business , hiring himself out as a clown for parties and showing up at school events dressed in shorts and a tie that dangled near to the floor he was also an athlete who excelled at crosscountry running and basketball his track coach said the young man was almost like a pacifist , shunning the violence that sometimes erupted within the walls of the school a beloved son he did not run to blood , said mr wargowsky if there was a stabbing at the school , he would stand against the wall and say it was stupid but he had his passions , especially the son he had with a previous girlfriend mr wargowsky recalled how the teenager would buy clothes for the child i know the commitment to his son was hard , he said and so was , his teachers thought , his commitment to the future he acted as if he really wanted out of his neighborhood , said mr wargowsky but there were glimpses of another life during some trips to manhattan , mr wargowsky recalled how mr lopez would seem to be known to everyone , especially the stonefaced youths on street corners one day they went to a store to buy a soda after a brisk jog when a man wearing gold chains and flashing a goldtoothed smile greeted mr lopez he 'd say , 'that used to be me , ' said mr wargowsky it seemed like he was a person who knew what it was about but stayed out he was not naive along the crowded , littered streets of mott haven , where burnedout apartment buildings loom above abandoned cars and wild youth , mr casellas cultivated a tough reputation
portauprince , haiti , oct 7 one day after united states and canadian forces started to arrive , plainclothes gunmen opposed to the restoration of democracy in haiti sprayed automaticweapons fire at street merchants and successfully shut down this city the gunmen collaborated openly with uniformed haitian police , the very forces who are supposed to be retrained by international police experts as part of a diplomatic settlement of haiti s political crisis at least two people were seriously wounded when gunmen fired on merchants who failed to heed a call for a general strike the gunmen also turned back the few buses that ventured onto empty streets and even chased residents back into their homes over 200 of the gunmen , known as attaches , gathered this morning at the main public square , mingling openly with heavily armed uniformed police later in the morning , one group of foreigners was stopped by plainclothesmen brandishing machine guns and hand grenades and warned to get off the streets first foreign troops arrive the intimidation campaign came as 50 royal canadian mounted police arrived on the second day of what is intended to be a rapid buildup of 1 , 300 foreign police officers and soldiers on wednesday , 26 united states soldiers , mostly doctors , engineers and linguists , flew here as an advance team for about 250 others , who are scheduled to arrive monday five canadian police officers arrived with the first americans no foreign forces were involved in confrontations with armed haitians today s strike , and a demonstration scheduled for friday , both organized by a shadowy group that calls itself the front for advancement and progress , seem intended to shake the resolve of the international community to restore the elected president , the rev jeanbertrand aristide , to power on oct 30 , as planned diplomats said haitians who oppose the return of father aristide after his twoyear exile hope to scare off those trying to reinstate him by making haiti appear too volatile for a delicate political transition to take place just side arms , or maybe none those engaged in the antiaristide offensive , which diplomats say is being led by the police commander , col joseph michel francois , are also taking advantage of the tightly restrictive rules of engagement for the lightly armed united nations force when armed at all , the 670 or so americans being deployed and a similar number of foreign police officers will carry only side arms the foreign forces , whose mission is to help separate haiti s police from the army and to retrain both corps , are prohibited from intervening in any way to stop any violence they may witness if these people have guns , the police have even bigger guns , said an elderly haitian , one of the few pedestrians downtown this morning like other haitians who have lived through massacres and years of armybacked repression , he said he had no doubt that those opposed to father aristide would use whatever force they felt they needed to stop his return diplomats said father aristide s opponents are also counting heavily on a shift in congressional and public opinion in the united states against risky international peacekeeping ventures such sentiment has mounted sharply since sunday , when 12 united states soldiers were killed in somalia recover is slow to nonexistent finally , with only three weeks to go until the president s scheduled return , his opponents are capitalizing on delays in carrying out the political settlement that was brokered by the united nations and signed on july 3 in new york at the time , diplomats who led the talks painted a picture of a haiti whose shattered economy would be well on its way to being refloated , its army well along in its retraining and its government firmly seated and productive , well before father aristide s return instead , haiti has been bogged down in rising violence , government gridlock and continued economic misery because of the insecurity , members of the president s transitional government , including prime minister robert malval , have been forced to work out of their homes in another delay , only slightly more than 200 of the 567 international police experts who are to be sent to haiti , most from candada and france , have been recruited sharing the blame haitian political experts say the blame for this must be shared between a diplomatic corps with little experience in this country s affairs and an army that is skilled at blocking progress at every step diplomats and cabinet members met today for three hours with the army commander , lieut gen raoul cedras , to discuss the deteriorating situation the army has failed to fulfill its constitutional role of providing security , a cabinet member said after the meeting participants in the meeting said general cedras , for his part , sought renewed assurances that an offer of amnesty by father aristide was airtight photo gunmen opposed to the restoration of democracy in haiti enforced a general strike that shut down portauprince a woman ventured out onto a deserted street yesterday in the normally busy main market area \( reuters \)
a fire destroyed a woolworth s store in harlem yesterday and burned for nearly six hours before firefighters brought it under control , but it caused only minor injuries , a fire department spokesman said eight firefighters and three other people suffered smoke inhalation , but none was hospitalized , said the spokesman , jerry sanford arson was a possibility , mr sanford said , because heavy amounts of fire were discovered as soon as firefighters arrived at the building , at broadway and 145th street at 4 pm last night , fire marshals began investigating the cause of the fire the fire blazed for more than five hours , climbing quickly from the store s basement through the second floor of the twostory building , mr sandford said it was not under control until 9 46 pm , by which time the building was thoroughly gutted , he said a number of hidden pockets of fire were difficult to reach , said mr sanford with all the merchandise in a woolworth s store burning , it just made it worse more than 40 firefighting units and 200 firefighters were called to the fire , a fouralarm blaze by late evening , flames were no longer visible to the pedestrians crowded outside , but firefighters threw water into the building from ladders
to the editor fresh money for poor communities \( editorial , aug 13 \) promotes several harmful myths about community reinvestment lending first , lowincome borrowers are not necessarily creditrisky available data from private mortgage insurance companies suggest that lowincome homeowners are far less likely to default on mortgages than highincome borrowers , in part because lowincome borrowers view homeownership as shelter , rather than investment and , after a decade of record losses on speculative investments in commercial real estate , we have yet to see a bank or savings and loan institution go belly up because of too much lending to poor people second , notwithstanding a dangerous campaign for regulatory relief by the banking industry , the community reinvestment act is not a source of massive paperwork burdens for banks the act has only three minor technical requirements , and the policy of bank regulatory agencies is that lenders need not keep any special documentation for the act s purposes a 1991 office of management and budget survey found the act to be the least burdensome consumer protection law on the books finally , the act is not the utter failure you portray nearly 35 billion has been lent in low and moderateincome neighborhoods as a result of the act many lenders , working with the very community development organizations you praise , have developed precisely the expertise in community lending whose lack you bemoan and the best community reinvestment act performers have found that community reinvestment lending is not just good social policy , but good business as well clearly , the act has not met its potential to revitalize neighborhoods but the real problem is a scandalous record of enforcement by the four federal banking agencies under 12 years of hostile administrations nearly 90 percent of lenders get satisfactory grades , and less than a dozen merger applications have ever been denied because of this law , despite abundant evidence of redlining as senator william proxmire , the author of the act , observed several years ago regulators seem to think that we 're all living in lake wobegone like the children of the fictional village , united states lenders are all above average almost all get high ratings year after year , and almost none is ever held back and i ask myself , how is it that so many neighborhoods are continuing to fail , while so many lending institutions are continuing to pass \? perhaps the administration s review of the act will reverse this outrageous record your suggestion that banks be allowed to buy out of the act through contributions to community development banks is seriously wrongheaded and smacks of the creation of a separate and unequal banking system , one for minorities and the poor , and another for everyone else turning the tide of despair in lowincome neighborhoods requires more than token charitable contributions from the banking industry we need mainstream lenders to view community reinvestment as a business proposition and to put the ingenuity of the market to work there the federal government confers on lenders a host of advantages public charters , taxpayerbacked deposit insurance at a discounted price and access to the discount window at the fed after having spent hundreds of billions of dollars to bail out these lenders , we have learned that all this public largess is not without fiscal consequence surely , the least we can expect in return is a banking system that fairly serves the needs of all americans maude hurd natl president , assn of community organizations for reform now boston , aug 17 , 1993 drawing
los angeles , april 6 two weeks before angelenos vote for a new mayor , an extraordinary possibility is emerging the leading candidate in this heavily democratic and liberal city is a new yorkborn republican who vows to put more police officers on the streets , trim the rest of local government and turn over many city services to private enterprise he is richard riordan , a 62yearold lawyer , selfmade millionaire , philanthropist and longtime power broker here who has never held public office mr riordan , who lives alone in a bookcluttered mansion in the exclusive brentwood section , says he wants the job because all my life i 've been a rescuer though he avoids any racial overtones in his campaign , the hardcharging mr riordan has benefited from the fear that is sweeping the city as two racially charged trials converge the expected conclusion this week of a federal trial of four police officers in the rodney g king beating and the beginning , on monday , of a trial of three black men in the beating a white trucker last year the beating of the trucker occurred in rioting that followed the acquittal of the officers on state charges in the king beating it is widely believed that renewed violence could strengthen mr riordan , whose motto is tough enough to turn la around with a campaign financed by 3 million of his own money , earned primarily through investments , mr riordan has flooded the city with advertisements and slick mailings and while there are no public opinion polls yet to document the prediction , his opponents agree he is almost certain to come in at least second , possibly first , in a field of 24 candidates in the april 20 election largely white electorate his most likely opponent in a june 8 runoff is michael woo , a 41yearold city councilman who is a los angeles native mr woo is a liberal democrat and as a chineseamerican is representative of the multiethnic melange that is los angeles today in such a runoff , mr riordan would face an uphill but not impossible fight though los angeles is overwhelmingly democratic and twothirds of its residents are black , hispanic and or other minorities , the electorate is still twothirds white , concentrated in the san fernando valley and the west side , where even liberals are arming themselves against possible racial disorders , and where the recession has hit hard i am stunned by the possibility in this day and age that the next mayor may be another white male establishment figure , and a republican , in a minoritymajority city , said sherry bebitch jeffe , a political analyst at the claremont graduate school in suburban pomona but the arithmetic is such that it cannot be ruled out if the turnout is low , the voters more likely to turn out are the riordan voters if mr riordan wins , it would mean the final dissolution of the powerful but frayed alliance among blacks , jews and downtown business interests that kept mayor tom bradley in office for 20 years other candidates none of the other candidates has caught on yet among them are assemblyman richard katz from the san fernando valley , who portrays himself as a democrat tough on crime nick patsaouras , a businessman and transportation commissioner whose plan to revive the city is heavily based on broadening public transit joel wachs , a city councilman from the san fernando valley with strong backing from the arts community , and linda griego , a businesswoman and former deputy mayor who has gotten financial support from women s groups this is a classic example of money being the mother s milk of politics , said jay severin , mr wachs s campaign consultant riordan s doing all the right things it s very tough to compete with him though the election is technically nonpartisan , mr riordan is the only republican in the field his strategy is to make the runoff by consolidating the 298 percent of voters who have registered as republican , then seek to broaden his appeal later the literature he sends to republican households stresses his ties to republicans like ronald reagan his latest television commercial uses the word tough six times in 30 seconds and though he promises to kick out the politicians who have led us into decline , mr riordan has long been a major contributor to most of california s leading politicians , including mayor bradley , a democrat , and gov pete wilson , republican a roman catholic , he says he supports a woman s right to choose an abortion , but he gives to antiabortion groups a major plank in mr riordan s platform is to put 3 , 000 more police officers on the streets without raising taxes he proposes paying for them by renting out los angeles international airport to private operators rather than have the city run it a neighborhood campaign his appeal was apparent at a picnic lunch for volunteers saturday afternoon in a park in the westwood area the nearly allwhite crowd voiced approval as he outlined his plans to fight graffiti and crime , to break up the los angeles unified school district and to fight illegal immigration we have to put tremendous pressure on the federal government to keep illegal aliens out of this country , he said among the volunteers were janice and roland behny , residents of the hancock park neighborhood , a mostly white area near downtown we 've had people murdered in front of our house , said mr behny , a sales manager for a publishing company the savages are taking over the city then mr riordan went knocking on doors on an street of neatly manicured 1 million homes in westwood , visiting mostly republican households , where there was palpable fear of crime but in an interview , mr riordan said he did not pander to racial fears , and pointed out that he had donated thousands of dollars to set up educational programs for minority youngsters and was the only white member of a leadership group called 100 black men bundle on contradictions crime , he said , is not the exclusive concern of affluent whites it s intolerable that a mother has to tell her child in southcentral los angeles to duck behind cars when there is shooting , he said the issues throughout the city are the same a bundle of energy and contradictions , mr riordan has bought his way into los angeles politics with a combination of charm , determination and money after graduating from princeton university and the university of michigan law school , he came here in 1956 to join a law firm through investments , he turned a moderate inheritance into a fortune estimated at more than 100 million he became a venture capitalist , engaging in restructuring insolvent companies and in leveraged buyouts financed by junk bonds issued by his friend michael milken , recently released from prison after serving a term violating securities law in an interview , mr riordan , who is divorced from his first wife and separated from his second , said he wanted the job because , i care he vows to work for 1 a year as mayor all my life i 've been a rescuer , he said there is a vacuum of leadership i am going to fill it but even mr riordan s admirers wonder what kind of mayor he would make he gets things done by cutting through red tape said mary nichols , who served with him on the city s recreation and parks commission but within city government , there is a tremendous amount of detail i'm not sure if he would not get bored with it pretty fast photo richard riordan , a new york native , is the leading candidate for mayor in los angeles mr riordan , who says he wants the job because all my life i 've been a rescuer , campaigned on monday in beverly hills \( jan sonnenmair for the new york times \)
tokyo , may 30 richard greer , a broker here , has spent a lot of time recently in latin america and will soon move to london in some ways , his departure may be a better indicator of the state of the tokyo stock market than the recent surge of the nikkei index after its threeyear collapse these days in the world of global investing , where fashions change as fast as hemlines , latin america and china are hot and eastern europe is getting warm tokyo , however , has lost that certain something that made it one of the hottest , if not the hottest , investment stages of the 1980 s it is a subjective feeling , but it is hard to miss for someone who , like mr greer , saw tokyo rise from obscurity into a sort of coney island of investing , and then collapse the mood has gotten more upbeat lately as prices have climbed from the cellar , but brokers like mr greer , branch manager of baring securities \( japan \) ltd for the last nine years , seem to sense that the real money , the crazy overnight fortunes and good times , lie elsewhere from sideshow to center ring it would be hard to reproduce the performance here over the last decade after years of being a sideshow to foreigners , the tokyo stock exchange exploded in one of history s greatest boom markets its value soared by nearly 4 trillion from 1985 to the end of 1989 , making a lot of japanese wealthy and financing an enormous expansion here of foreign brokers , who filled some of tokyo s hottest topless clubs and thrumming nightclubs that shower of gold was followed by nearly 3 trillion in losses when the market ran out of steam in 1990 few believe the market will swing up , or down , so violently again indeed , many experts here say , the tokyo market seems to have bade its adolescence farewell to move into a more sedate middle age mr greer , 38 , helped build baring securities into one of the most profitable foreign brokerage houses here , and for a time it was the source of most of the profits of barings plc , one of london s oldest merchant banks baring securities' former chairman , christopher heath , was reputed to be the highest paid executive in london in the late 1980 s , thanks to the cascade of profits from japan mr greer did pretty well , too he put together a personal collection that includes avantgarde japanese art and six soviet military tanks \( all in perfect working order \) , which he keeps in england our entire move into emerging markets , which is our focus now , was bankrolled by what we made in tokyo , mr greer said but these days there are none of the extravagant parties that once filled the ballrooms of tokyo s imperial hotel with throngs of stockbrokers hovering over 15yardlong tables laden with foie gras , caviar , smoked salmon and roasts , to mark office openings or the arrival of top executives from new york and london those banquets were weekly events in the late 80 s , but today brokers exchange gossip at farewell parties , usually at a friend s home one of those apartments that rent for 10 , 000 to 15 , 000 a month they sip wine , nibble on nuts and cheese and talk about the great opportunities in hong kong and latin america further signs of the times were mr heath s ouster from baring securities this year , a move reportedly related to declining profits from japan , and mr greer s decision to leave japan for headquarters in london , where he will track more promising markets in the last year , baring securities' staff here has declined from 265 people to fewer than 200 how times change mr greer arrived in tokyo at age 26 , not long after graduating from cambridge university in his native england , and took a modest flat that cost the equivalent at the time of about 1 , 200 a month japan , he recalled , was strange and intoxicating because of the sense that it was all so new , sort of like alice in wonderland tokyo did not exactly embrace newcomers until 1986 , foreign brokers were not allowed to buy seats on the tokyo stock exchange initially , mr greer was hired by a tiny brokerage house run by the enterprising mr heath it specialized in selling japanese shares to british and other foreign institutions mr greer began its research department in tokyo in 1984 the firm was acquired by barings plc and was renamed baring secutities there was a staff of nine in london and seven in tokyo in those days , mr greer recalled , japanese companies were generally delighted to get a call from a foreign analyst and arranged meetings with senior executives at a moment s notice a sharp contrast to the more formal and distant attitude today an analyst s job now can be rather dreary , he said but then , there was real excitement because you could really discover something rumors would sweep the market a huge gold discovery on the southern island of kyushu \( the deposits turned out to be modest and difficult to mine \) , an invention that would let television makers build ultrathin tubes of crystalclear quality that would hang flat against a wall at a fraction of the cost of existing television sets \( such technology is being developed , but is believed to be years away from commercial development

for joseph w klene , yesterday morning began just like every other morning he pulverized two big round tablets in his coffee grinder , dissolved the powder in tap water and drank the concoction that he said tasted like sweet salty chalk throughout the day , he swallowed 10 other pills , all part of a daily routine that he has followed for the last two months to test an experimental threedrug treatment that was initially described as a possible breakthrough in the fight against aids but last week mr klene and most of the 400 hivinfected adults who are testing the drugs were taken for another twist in the wrenching ride that is part of being on the front lines in the battle against aids they heard the news that scientists had discovered that the treatment may not be so promising elation or uncertainty \? the news came in the 10th week that mr klene has been part of the drug trial , a period that has seen him bounce from the elation of being chosen from among thousands of applicants to the uncertainty over whether he would receive a placebo to the fear that if the drugs actually allowed him to survive , he would have to completely reevaluate a life that had been predicated on early death with that emotional backdrop , mr klene approached the latest news stoically and clung to any hope that the drugs might provide even if expectations are lower , he said , the trial is still as good as it gets it s a step toward a solution , mr klene said maybe they should say , 'one day we 'll figure it out and we 'll tell you' combining 3 drugs last february , a group of researchers from massachusetts general hospital and harvard medical school instead announced that they had found what may be the achilles' heel of the virus in laboratory tests they had used a combination of three drugs to attack a single component of the virus , an enzyme that makes copies of the virus s genetic material , and try to force it to resist the drugs through several mutations that are incompatible with replication in the test tube , the researchers reported , the combination stopped hiv from replicating and spreading to other cells when trials began in may , mr klene , a 41yearold computer consultant from new york city , was given one of 11 slots at memorial sloankettering cancer center in manhattan he and the others were chosen primarily because they had severely damaged immune systems and because they had already taken one of the three drugs approved for hiv treatment ddi , azt or ddc the drugs under research include two of these azt \( zidovudine \) and ddi \( didanosine \) and an experimental one , nevirapine trial is continuing but last month other scientists reported that they had not been able to confirm the original laboratory findings the massachusetts research team has since discovered that the mutation that stopped the virus from growing was not induced by the threedrug combination , which further studies showed hiv can resist they do not know how the mutation originated or whether it can be reproduced the trial , scheduled for 48 weeks , has not been halted officials involved with the trial say the combination therapy is still a valid concept that deserves further study there are other pieces of evidence that suggest that combinations of drugs may be better than just one drug , said dr henry s sacks , in charge of the study at mount sinai hospital , one of 16 medical centers helping to conduct the trial around the country it s still reasonable to continue this study and try to get the clinical answer of whether the combination is of benefit or not mr klene says his own reasons for entering the trial still hold true the best in health care , the possibility of prolonging life and the need to reassure himself that he has not given up no feeling powerlessxxx even though he is just host to the combat between the drugs and the virus , he does not feel completely powerless about the outcome i also know that the cofactor in all of this is your emotional wellbeing , and i do n't think the studies take that into consideration , he said that cofactor failed him briefly last month , after he was selected for the trial and began taking the drugs he soon began experiencing an array of largely unexpected symptoms lightheadedness and headaches , loss of appetite and energy , blurred vision , ringing in the ears , nausea , vomiting and diarrhea his blood pressure dropped and he lost 12 pounds he became so sick for no apparent reason that the trial s research nurse , glennon sutterer , asked him are you nervous that you might live now \? mr klene was , and still is having resigned himself to the inevitability of early death , he said , he was not prepared for the possibility of living beyond the few years that aids usually allows you filter everything through aids , he says if that goes , it s like your father dying it s such a massive change in your thought system wondering about how profoundly his life would change again if the drugs succeeded , he said he began worrying about a job , pension plans and his companion , who also has aids but does not believe in taking drugs for it backdrop of despair
st petersburg , fla for many years before helping to found home shopping network inc , roy m speer , the company s chairman , savored the role of freewheeling entrepreneur , taking advantage of opportunities wherever he found them but the troubles now roiling the cable television retailer based here suggest that mr speer may have since fallen prey to the entrepreneur s classic mistake blurring personal interests and those of a publicly held company for example , home shopping network has paid over 12 million since 1988 to pioneer data processing inc , a company owned by mr speer s son , for ordertaking and related computer software but in littlenoticed testimony in a business dispute between home shopping network and the gte corporation , mr speer s personal accountant , richard w baker , stated that the software was not compatible with the main ordertaking computers used by the retailer since the mid1980 s and that a contract under which payments were made to pioneer data expired in 1988 until last month , the company stated in securities and exchange commission filings that software programs developed by pioneer data were currently being used to take orders 2 related companies in the filings , home shopping network has disclosed its relationships to pioneer data and another company run by richard m speer , mr speer s son he is the sole shareholder of western hemisphere sales inc , which was paid by home shopping network to liquidate unsold merchandise western hemisphere has since merged with pioneer data roy speer did not return telephone calls to his office seeking an interview , and an associate said he was out of the country richard speer and mr baker also did not return calls to their offices a spokesman for home shopping network , citing pending litigation , declined to respond to questions about the software payments or other matters raised in mr baker s deposition both roy speer and lowell w paxson , the cofounder and former president of the home shopping network , have previously denied assertions raised in a matrimonial dispute and in a recent suit by a former company lawyer that they had profited from insider dealings , had secret holdings in merchandise vendors or had paid hush money to a former company lawyer to stop him from disclosing those relationships a federal grand jury in tampa , fla , is investigating those assertions and the company is under scrutiny by the sec for their part , officials of home shopping network have recently begun a damagecontrol campaign last week , liberty media inc , which in december purchased roy speer s controlling interest in home shopping network for 168 million in cash and stock , offered to buy an additional 105 million of home shopping network stock and gerald hogan , who was installed by liberty media as the retailer s chief executive , has announced a number of initiatives to upgrade the company s image former home shopping network executives and employees who were recently interviewed say it is the 60yearold roy speer who holds the answers to the questions now surrounding the company even his harshest critics acknowledge that he provided the drive that made home shopping network into a wall street success story when it went public in 1986 , an offering that also helped to make him and mr paxson fortunes overnight that company was run practically singlehandedly by chairman roy speer , said patrick grey , a former executive with home shopping network who now works for the international acceptance corporation in dallas everything was either approved by him or initiated by him it was the role that roy speer clearly relished a large , heavily built man with a quick temper , former associates said he enjoyed generating ideas for new ways to sell products and services on television but while he created the company s homey televised image , he also regularly intimidated colleagues and transformed the retailer into a company that turned over personnel almost as quickly as products , several former executives said in interviews roy speer s enjoyment of chaos might have well reflected the nonstop nature of his own business dealings trained as a lawyer , he worked as a public prosecutor in the 1960 s varied interests since then , roy speer has been involved in a host of ventures including real estate , construction , oil and gas he has remained active in many of his own private enterprises while serving as chairman and , until recently , chief executive of home shopping network to which he devotes about 75 percent of his time , the company said in a filing with the sec the current round of accusations involving roy speer is not the first time that he or mr paxson have been accused of mixing personal and corporate interests in 1989 , lawyers for gte questioned mr baker in the deposition in pursuing a claim that the two top home shopping network officials had erected a complex , elaborate network of corporate entities to mask the true nature of their business selfdealings
boston you guys are irrelevant , a quicktalking man said in a room full of newspaper publishers here on wednesday morning then , to drive the point home , he added , you are extinct the speaker was alf nucifora , an atlantabased marketing consultant , not a newspaperman but none of the publishers in the room , and it was a big one , rose to challenge his assertion maybe that was because it was just 7 am , one of many prebreakfast sessions in the busy week of the annual publishers convention or maybe it was because the marketing man was so obviously indulging , as marketing men will , in a bit of overstatement or perhaps , and this seemed the most likely reason , it was because an outsider had finally put into words the worry that seemed to be on the minds of so many of the publishers of the country s major newspapers as they met here the future has just about arrived , and it is not clear if , or perhaps what kind of , newspapers will be in it in the short term , newspapers are feeling a lift from the moderate recovery and from a host of new businesses , like audiotext systems that give readers a way of getting access to newspapers' information by telephone newspaper readership remains extraordinarily high despite years of declines every day , 115 million people read a newspaper in america on sunday , 125 million read a newspaper but in the long term and no one knows if that is 5 years or 30 changing technology and changing consumer and advertiser appetites will almost certainly bring changes to the media world as farreaching as those that accompanied the arrival of the printing press the question is can newspapers adapt to those changes fast enough or will they be left out of the new digital , interactive videoenhanced age \? many of the industry s leaders say that the newspaper business has reached a crossroad and that now is the time that newspapers must choose their path toward the future that will not be an easy process newspapers are complex manufacturing businesses with costly printing presses and intricate distribution systems and they are cumbersome institutions that change slowly they are also journalism organizations , some of whose members believe in telling as much of the truth as it is possible to discover by deadline mr nucifora , the marketing man , brought what he presented as proof of his thesis that the commercial clock has already run out for newspapers grocery stores , once a newspaper mainstay , have already largely abandoned newspapers in favor of directmail advertisers mr nucifora showed a sample of why directmail companies now provide some grocery store customers with discount food coupons with printed bar codes that indicate who the shopper is by matching the code to the original mailing address the grocery store s computers can then record every item purchased on a particular store visit if a coupon is used armed with that information , a retailer can specifically aim future advertising and marketing pitches this new level of personal commercial pitches has already scared and confused newspapers publishers are only now trying to catch up to the game that is going on without them by trying to better specify the audiences they deliver to advertisers but the pain in store for the newspaper industry is likely to extend far beyond what amounts to a heightened battle for advertisers in boston , it was clear that newspaper people are realizing that to fight the battle they will have to grapple with what it is that makes newspapers matter should newspapers remain committed to the printed word \? should they sell information about their readers \? should they bow to the pressure to entertain or is their primary purpose to inform \? is it possible to inform and entertain \? is it necessary to be able to hold a printed newspaper in your hand for it to deliver an important message \? some in the industry say it is time to try to answer such questions frank a bennack jr , president of the hearst corporation and until his term ended last week the chairman of the publishers trade association , said that in his 40 years in journalism he had never sensed such a broad commitment to change but change is sometimes easier to talk about at conventions than it is back home w russell neuman , director of the communications research group at the massachusetts institute of technology s media laboratory , suggested that the publishers should begin to think about their business differently they should , he said , be prepared to decouple decouple from paper mr neuman suggested that publishers think of themselves as being in a different business they should think of themselves , he said , as suppliers of news , not of newspapers their trade group , he said , should change its name from the newspaper association of america to the news association of america there were on the floor of the convention no immediate proponents of dropping the word paper from newspaper and the publishers went home drawing
a survey s finding that only 1 percent of men identify themselves as homosexual has renewed intense debate over the number of gay people in america many sociologists , poll takers and political analysts said yesterday that they believed the actual number of gay men was higher than 1 percent but they also said it was probably lower than the 10 percent in a frequently cited study conducted in the late 1940 s the debate was prompted by the alan guttmacher institute s release this week of data based on facetoface interviews in 1991 with 3 , 321 men from the ages of 20 through 39 the size of the nation s homosexual population has long been at issue , all the more so in recent years as the gay civil rights movement has gained momentum the number has political implications , since it translates into constituents , which translates into votes the debate flares at a crucial time , as congress considers whether to allow homosexuals in the military and as gay and lesbian americans prepare for a huge march on washington on april 25 to press for a gay civil rights bill almost immediately religious conservatives leaped on the 1 percent figure , preparing at least one news release and asserting that estimates of the size of the homosexual population had long been inflated by gay organizations for political benefit 'behavioral oddity' finally , the truth has surfaced , said the rev lou sheldon , chairman of the traditional values coalition , which says it has a membership of 27 , 000 member churches homosexuality is a behavioral oddity , certainly not entitled to special protective status with this , i think we will have seen a turning point what stonewall was to gay bashing , this shall be for socalled special protected status gay leaders have contended that the number of gay and lesbian americans was around 10 percent , a figure that many of them suspected to be inflated but they repeated the number often , they said , as a way of encouraging the nation s large population of closeted homosexuals to be open about their sexual identity yesterday , gay groups scoffed at the 1 percent figure , saying that even though the researchers promised respondents anonymity , many homosexuals were afraid to disclose their sexual orientation in any case , in a shift from past emphasis , many gay leaders played down the importance of the size of the homosexual population this study was n't conducted in a vacuum , said robert bray , a spokesman for the national gay and lesbian task force we live in a society where gay people are reluctant to come forward for fear of oppression but even if the number is correct , for us the issue is discrimination , whether we are 1 million or 10 million or 100 million the issue still remains ending discrimination and violence against us survey flaw asserted he and others added that the study was faulty , as many men in their 20 s have not realized their sexual identity the 10 percent figure came from a 1948 report by alfred kinsey that found approximately 10 percent of white american males were more or less exclusively homosexual for at least three years between the ages of 16 and 55 dr kinsey found that 4 percent were exclusively homosexual on a lifelong basis but those results have been under attack for a decade as the methodology was questioned many of the interviews , for example , were conducted in institutions , raising questions about their application to the nationwide population half a dozen studies in the last five years have put the gay population in the single digits , though none as low as 1 percent they tend to be in the range of 2 to 25 percent , said robert c colodny , medical director of the behavior medicine institute in new canaan , conn , and a consultant to the masters and johnson institute , which studies sexual behavior in fact , one survey analyzing the president vote found that 3 percent of men and 2 percent of women said they were gay , lesbian or bisexual murray edelman , director of voter research surveys , which conducted the survey on election day for the four television networks , has estimated that because of reluctance to be open about homosexuality , the actual homosexual vote was probably slightly higher , at around 4 percent total , which would make it roughy the size of the jewish vote during the presidential campaign , in which bill clinton courted the gay vote , his campaign aides estimated the size of the gay population at roughly 5 to 6 percent of the nation s total all in the ball park we 're all in the general ball park , said john o g billy , a demographer at the battelle memorial institute in seattle , which released the latest study we 're all much lower than kinsey in a french study conducted in 199192 , 4 percent of men and 3 percent of women reported having had sex with a person of the same sex in their lifetimes , but only 11 percent of men had done so over the previous year in a british study , 4 percent of respondents said they had had a homosexual partner at one time , with 14 percent saying it had been in the past five years demographers said one reason the 1 percent figure may seem small was that homosexuals tend to be concentrated in metropolitan areas , or at least to be more likely in those areas to acknowledge being gay in the british and french studies , figures for homosexuals were four times greater in london and paris than in the nation sean strub , who runs a marketing firm in manhattan that keeps mailing lists of homosexuals for sale to advertisers and politicians , estimated the size of the country s gay population at 25 percent to 35 percent no one will ever know what it rally is , he said people lie about their sexuality more than anything else people are afraid to say they 're gay , and who can blame them \?

when the port authority of new york and new jersey first proposed a light rail system that would finally link new york city s airports to manhattan by sleek , quiet electric trains , people cheered but now that the plans are nearing completion with a proposal to put the manhattan terminal in one of the worst traffic spots in the city rumblings of opposition are surfacing just about everyone recognizes the need for better access to kennedy international and la guardia airports , where congested highways are the principal transportation connection to the rest of the city but the proposed location of the manhattan terminal , on east 59th street near third avenue , has made many people queasy the neighborhood is already a nightmare for motorists , with traffic from the queensboro bridge flowing into an area teeming with office workers and shoppers on the edge of the residential upper east side accompanying that fear of congestion is a rising chorus of support for extending the rail line to grand central terminal , even if it means spending more money on the project and taking longer to build it grand central is a more convenient location , the argument goes , and can better handle hordes of new commuters a 100year plan if this system has to last for 100 years , what s another 500 million \? said brenda levin , a member of the new york city planning commission , referring to the additional amount that port authority officials say it would cost to run the train all the way to grand central the port authority has held 122 community meetings to explain the 2 billion undertaking , which is scheduled to be completed in 2003 and is one of the largest public works projects in a halfcentury officials painstakingly defend what they say is the internal logic of the proposed route that wends 20 miles from kennedy airport to 59th street almost entirely along public rights of way the present proposal enjoys major political backing from gov mario m cuomo , mayor david n dinkins and others but three community boards whose districts touch on east 59th street , as well as the manhattan borough president , ruth w messinger , have also voiced concern about the proposed terminal site originally , the port authority was going to end the rail line in long island city , queens , but critics immediately dubbed any system that stopped short of manhattan a road to nowhere last year , when the port authority realized it could use the lower outer roadways on the queensboro bridge for the railway , planners began examining sites on 59th street for the terminal they seem to be zeroing in on the old alexander s department store on third avenue between 58th and 59th streets , which is empty but two other sites east of third avenue are under consideration a third avenue terminal could neatly connect the rail line underground with the the nos 4 , 5 and 6 and the n and r subway lines , and would make it more accessible to workers in midtown , officials say while studies indicate that taxi traffic in the terminal area would grow by 410 vehicles from 4 to 5 pm alone each day , the port authority has proposed steps to mitigate traffic running a jitney from major hotels to the terminal , rerouting traffic onto the franklin d roosevelt drive and creating two new lanes that would bisect the terminal building s ground floor for taxi use would reduce congestion , said edward j o sullivan , director of the port authority s airport access program in addition , the port authority estimates that there would be 4 , 300 fewer vehicles on the streets of manhattan each day as a result of a new airport rail system , 760 fewer from 4 to 5 pm alone money s not everything even if there were additional money above the airport user fees dedicated to the project to pay for a grand central link , the port authority would not automatically shift gears studies show that there are the same number of potential airport commuters within a mile of each site extending the line from 59th street to grand central would also require condemning property , mr o sullivan said , and likely entail tunneling through schist under madison avenue and ripping up the road to relocate utility lines and pipes a terminal on east 59th street , however , would be relatively simple to construct and could be achieved without condemnations and while advocates of a grand central link note that it would allow easy access to metronorth commuter lines , focus groups have indicated that suburban passengers would continue to drive to the airports regardless of where the terminal was situated psychologically , people think of grand central as a major transportation hub , which it is , but it s not necessarily where the airport passengers are coming to and from , mr o sullivan said once environmental impact studies are finished , the federal aviation administration ultimately has to sign off on the project , which would be financed by a 3 fee that has been collected since last summer on departing passengers at kennedy , la guardia and newark airports if approved , the rail system could be under construction by 1996 a sure thing complaints as the rail link moves from concept to concrete plan , opposition is certain to mount motorists are going to complain like crazy about losing capacity on the queensboro bridge , and there 'll be opposition from residents over traffic congestion , said jeffrey m zupan , of the regional plan association , an independent research group mr o sullivan calls the 59th street terminal location the 64 question and says that if it ca n't be resolved , the train wo n't come to manhattan that makes some critics wonder just how open the process is we hear a lot about how alternatives are going to be considered in the environmental impact statement , said jess a velona , chairman of the airport access subcommittee of community board six but all the presentations focus on a single route and terminus and ms messinger , the borough president , asserted this week that east 59th street was not a part of town that could easily adapt to 400 to 600 taxis an hour and predicted severe economic impacts but none of the criticism has yet to faze stanley brezenoff , who as head of the port authority , considers the airport link crucial to the city s welfare this is the one megaproject that perhaps can be built

in a grand gesture , rita rudner has donated the canaryyellow fred hayman jogging suit she wears in peter s friends to the planet hollywood film collection it may not be the rosebud sled from citizen kane , but the suit does count as one of the more memorable cinematic encounters between unbridled american vulgarity and british restraint , with ms rudner playing a willful hollywood actress forced to spend a weekend at an english country house with her husband , played by kenneth branagh , and five of his old classmates from cambridge none of the group , summoned by the peter of the film s title , know quite what to make of the creature that their old friend has brought into their midst she is britain s nightmare of the ugly american loud , brassy , obsessed with diet and exercise , virtually illiterate and impervious to nuance ms rudner describes the character as a combination of elizabeth taylor and leona helmsley , and she came to the role prepared i brought my own costumes from america , because i knew they would n't have hollywood clothes , she said during a recent interview in her hotel room in manhattan besides the jogging suit , i chose a goldlame bob mackie dress but i did n't go overboard i did n't get plastic surgery or change my hair color ms rudner has a deadpan , pensive delivery , much more subdued and deliberate than her spaceydizzy standup style , that suggests she might have given both options serious consideration babies and laughter when , out of the blue , the topic of babies comes up , ms rudner turns that over a few times , too like many women of a certain age , she has been debating whether to take the plunge a photographer tries to sell her on the idea , describing his joy the first time his infant daughter laughed at a funny noise he made for her ms rudner turns a quizzical gaze on him i'm a comedian , she says people laugh at me all the time and i get paid for it i really do n't think that the laughter part is enough incentive peter s friends performed strongly at the box office in britain and , since opening on christmas day in limited release , has done well in this country , too \( it opens nationwide tomorrow \) although some critics have dismissed the film as a warmedover british version of the big chill , the reviews have been mostly positive janet maslin , in the new york times , called it a cheerfully derivative comedy that borrows so blatantly from 'the big chill' that it takes a while to realize that this film has a life of its own most reviewers agreed that ms rudner comes close to walking away with the picture ms rudner s performance , her first in a film , is one surprise in peter s friends , which was produced and directed by mr branagh the other is the screenplay , which is witty , literate and very british it was written by ms rudner , with her husband , martin bergman , an englishman who saw ms rudner at catch a rising star in 1984 and brought her to britain for the edinburgh festival like the characters in peter s friends , mr bergman performed in the footlights comedy troupe at cambridge , where he became friends with of the film s costars , stephen fry and hugh laurie , both familiar to pbs audiences for their roles as jeeves and bertie wooster , respectively , on masterpiece theater a third actor in the film , emma thompson , the wife of mr branagh , he had known as a high school student mr bergman went on to write comic sketches for bbc television and radio he also produced ms rudner s hbo comedy specials , born to be mild and onenight stand , as well as the rita rudner specials , which were broadcast on british television and later on the arts entertainment network in the united states learning to write movies after marrying in 1987 , the couple decided to take up screenwriting as a way to work together and cut back on ms rudner s travel schedule by way of education , they attended a screenwriting course and watched old films on video , and then turned out two plotdriven comedies of the kind they call findthetreasure movies both screenplays were optioned but never made last year , they pitched the idea for peter s friends to mr branagh , whom they knew socially he liked it and put up part of the backing through his company , renaissance films the rest of the financing came from the film s distributor , samuel goldwyn we wrote the screenplay in five days , said ms rudner , who says she tends to concentrate on female characters , her husband on the males she describes their collaborative method as mutual nagging martin looks at me and says , 'you do it , ' then i look at him and say 'no , you do it why should i do it \? ' the last person who says 'you do it' wins ms rudner professes surprise at the big chill comparison it s old friends getting together , she said , but from there on 'peter s friends' is totally different it s a drawing room comedy that even extends to farce it has a comedic bent all the way through it s been so long since people have seen 'the big chill' that they do n't remember what it was really like when reminded that the film , like the big chill , has a soundtrack of period rockandroll songs , ms rudner said , i did not want to do that , but it was not my call odd couple critics have also wondered whether , in real life , the witty , disaffected writer played by mr branagh would ever have tolerated more than two minutes in the presence of ms rudner s character , much less married her , even if romance did blossom at the betty ford clinic i do n't believe some of my friends who get married , ms rudner said firmly yesterday i got off the plane and they had sent my bags back to los angeles i did n't believe that either , but it happened believable or not , the relationship makes for delicious comedy , as mr branagh registers 57 varieties of refined pain at the spectacle of his wife , and ms rudner undergoes the cultural equivalent of electroshock therapy when trying to adjust to the british way of life ms rudner said i love it when kenneth pats stephen on the stomach as a way of commenting on his paunch , and stephen says 'it s called a potbelly we have those in england , along with culture' in one setpiece encounter , ms rudner , traumatized at the sight of meat and fat , tries to explain her dietary needs to a flinty housekeeper her desperation mounting , ms rudner presses a wad of banknotes into the woman s shirt pocket and orders her to run out for fresh vegetables nothing doing infuriated , ms rudner turns on her heels , and snaps out , did you never see 'upstairs , downstairs' \? a rarity adult comedy ms rudner and mr bergman specialize in an unusual commodity , sophisticated adult comedy , a tough row to hoe in the mainstream film business ms rudner cites as her models the great hollywood comedies of the 30 s , like the philadelphia story , adam s rib and the screwball comedies of preston sturges , a type of film that hollywood is no longer attracted to or equipped to produce comedies do n't get made because they are messed with so much at the studio , and are so demographically contrived that they do n't work , she said ms rudner was told many times that peter s friends could never get the backing of a major studio , which may have been for the best she and mr bergman now find themselves the object of flattering attention and multiple offers before , we were sort of on the outskirts of the outskirts in los angeles , because you 're not really anybody unless you 've made a film , ms rudner said now we 're sort of on the outskirts of the inskirts photo in the movie peter s friends , rita rudner plays britain s nightmare of the ugly american loud , brassy , obsessed with diet and exercise , virtually illiterate and impervious to nuance \( fred r conrad the new york times \)
washington , june 10 a white house advisory committee says that the new options for a scaledback space station depend too much on the space shuttle and that nasa should use unmanned rockets to carry the heaviest parts in a report delivered to the white house today , the independent panel said it was too risky to depend upon the shuttle as the sole launching vehicle it recommended using a rocket like the russian proton , european ariane 5 , or american titan 4 other space experts previously questioned the wisdom of depending too much on the shuttle to build and maintain a space station for fear that an accident , like the 1986 challenger explosion , could ground the shuttle fleet and jeopardize the station the white house panel also said the space agency should put any space station into an orbit crossing the equator at a greater angle than those traditionally used by american spacecraft , one similar to the 516degree path used by the russians such a flight path would allow russia and other nations to reach the station , reducing costs and providing more landing sites in case of an emergency , it said smaller and cheaper the 16member committee , which assessed the space agency s redesign of the orbital laboratory to make it smaller and cheaper as ordered by president clinton , said all three general options were feasible all would cost more than administration guidelines but were substantially cheaper than the estimated 34 billion it would have taken to build the bigger space station originally envisioned , the panel said the report , which is to be formally accepted on friday by vice president al gore , said two of three general design options developed by the national aeronautics and space administration deserved further consideration , including one that used streamlined hardware developed for space station freedom and a new concept that would launch the large core of a station in one rocket flight using space shuttle technology the committee turned away from the third option , which retained the most elements of the old design the executive summary of the report said a modestly scaledback version of the current station that had been favored by many supporters in congress was not the top alternative congressional supporters of the project have said any design that substantially differs from the current space station plan would have difficulty getting support from congress the committee , headed by dr charles m vest , president of the massachusetts institute of technology , said it had confidence in the realism of nasa s new cost estimates for a space station , the nation s largest scientific research project nasa has spent almost 9 billion on the decadeold project , a figure expected to grow to 11 billion by the end of 1993 the agency s redesign team told the committee on monday that the nation would have to spend an additional 251 billion from fiscal 1994 through the end of the decade to complete a permanently manned space station freedom reaching that goal through one of the two options preferred by the panel would require 152 billion to 17 billion during that time , nasa said a 45member nasa team , which spent three months on a crash program to cut costs , said none of the options allowed building a permanently staffed station in space for the additional money white house officials said the administration would consider dr john gibbons , the president s science adviser , asked the agency to develop alternatives that would require spending 5 billion , 7 billion or 9 billion from fiscal years 1994 to 1998 to produce an operational station to continue with the freedom project would have required spending 176 billion in that time , and the options preferred by the advisory panel would have cost 119 billion to 133 billion , and neither would produce a completed , permanently staffed station , the nasa team estimated a space station alternative that would allow astronauts to visit the laboratory only for a few weeks at a time is not a worthwhile option for the nation to pursue , the panel said the report said the station s international partners , including the european space agency , japan and canada , have committed almost 4 billion to produce modules for the project however , it said , at the financing levels suggested by the administration , none of the options proposed by nasa would be developed enough to use any of this equipment the panel said there was the growing perception of the us as an unreliable partner in scientific pursuits , which could hurt future cooperative efforts
the moment said more than any other about the current emotional state of the twotime defending national basketball association champions throughout an emotional evening , the chicago bulls had been frustrated by the decisions of officials , and perhaps by their own limitations with 7 minutes 34 seconds to play in the second game of the eastern conference championship series against the knicks , the bulls suffered a sudden , shocking setback scottie pippen , who had scored 2 points in the previous 9 37 , was called for a discontinued dribble by the referee bill oakes , a decision that upset the chicago bench and began a quickly developing chain of events spectator at comeback pippen s ejection , after he flipped the ball directly at the official , cost the bulls their secondleading scorer for the remainder of a game in which they were trailing , 8371 , at the time pippen could only watch the final minutes from the chicago dressing room later as a bulls' comeback cut a 14point deficit to 2 with pippen no longer available and the chicago comeback lacking an essential part , the bulls left for home last night trailing the fourofsevengame series two games to none we did n't expect to be put in this position , pippen said and he seemed shocked by the position he occupied i did not double , pippen said of the original call i felt like it was a bad call he asked me for the ball i tossed him the ball that s pretty much it that was only the beginning feels it was intentional in a statement released by the league , oakes , who ejected pippen , suggested he felt the hard toss of the ball had been intentional after the violation , oakes said , he threw the ball at me and hit me in the chest , right below my head he threw it in such a manner that warranted an immediate ejection pippen finished with 17 points on 7of12 shooting other than michael jordan , pippen was the only member of the bulls to take more than six shots pippen scored only 4 points in the second half , making 2 of 5 shots after halftime , and he committed 2 of his 3 turnovers in the second half but even with his secondhalf problems , pippen s absence in the final minutes made chicago s comeback that much more remarkable 'a terrible call' afterward , pippen charged that the raucous capacity crowd at madison square garden had influenced oakes s decision to call the violation , the technical foul and the ejection i think it was a terrible call , pippen said of the discontinued dribble ruling i think the fans forced him to make the call , and not only that but the fans made him eject me from the game there was no reason i should have been ejected from the game i felt like they tried to make him think i tried to embarrass him i did not try to do that , no way i did n't know if the ball hit him , pippen said of the official he caught me by surprise i did n't try to embarrass him in any way evidently he felt that way i did n't think i deserved it let everyone down pippen acknowledged that something had to be called after he flipped the ball toward oakes he felt , and chicago coach phil jackson agreed , that the call should have been a technical foul rather than an ejection i think it was an unjust call , pippen said anytime you 're taken out of the game , you felt like you not only let the team down , but you let yourself down i definitely wanted to be in the game i wanted to be a part of it , what we were trying to accomplish pippen s forced departure may have accomplished one thing for the bulls it may have indirectly kept jordan in the game at the finish jordan spoke angrily of the flagrant foul against him by greg anthony with 4 16 to go , an action which earned anthony an ejection the bulls star drew a connection between pippen s ejection and the need for him to avoid a retaliation i knew scottie pippen had been thrown out of the game , jordan said i did n't want to get kicked out of the game but if i had my opportunity , i would have taken advantage of it
he loved to be called the red baron as he flew vintage fighter planes and built a small california savings and loan association into the nation s largest he showed a generation of bankers how to gamble with insured deposits and abuse flexible accounting rules to cover up the losses now charles w knapp is going to prison his crime , for which a federal judge sentenced him to 6 1 2 years last week , was submitting false financial statements to get a 15 million loan from an arizona savings and loan that later went under one tactic he used was to sell an asset to himself , then report the value at the last price he supposedly paid that crime had nothing to do with financial corporation of america , which made him famous but those who recall that company will not be surprised fca , as it was known , grew faster than any savings and loan had ever grown before mr knapp practically invented the process of using brokers to bring in insured deposits , and then investing the highcost money in land deals that grew ever riskier to keep the profits flowing , his company pioneered a variety of accounting maneuvers a classic was the buysell in which mr knapp s company agreed to finance land developments if it was first allowed to buy the property and then , minutes later , sell it to the developer for a nice profit that gain was phony , of course , although it was years before investors found out what was really going on regulators knew mr knapp was playing it risky long before the deal that made fca the largest savings and loan operator in the country , the 1983 acquisition of american savings and loan but they thought that having a big , safe institution would provide him the cushion needed to write off bad loans , and they thought they had promises he would mend his behavior in less than a year , it was clear that no such thing was happening but by then the regulators could n't afford to close the thrift the insurance fund simply did n't have enough money to pay the depositors so they pushed him out with fca paying him 2 million to go away and delayed the inevitable failure until 1988 mr knapp fancied himself a financial wizard , and set up a merchant banking operation called trafalgar holdings after he was exiled from fca it announced lots of deals , but none ever closed , evidently because he did not have the money he claimed prosecutors in the case just ended say that at one point he bought an interest in some land with a 1 million down payment the check was drawn on an account with 800 in it mr knapp deserves to be remembered on wall street not for the crime that is sending him to prison , but for the lesson that rapid growth in a financial business is suspicious money is fungible , and the easiest way to gain market share is to lend to those that others wo n't touch that is what mr knapp did , and it was that , not the aggressive accounting that for a time hid what he was up to , that did in fca graphs showing the dow for the past week and share prices and assets of financial corp of america from 1982 to 1988
a visit from the president , a flurry of broadcast appearances and saturationstrength television commercials propelled the new york city mayoral campaign toward its final weekend yesterday as mayor david n dinkins rolled into highgeared attack and rudolph w giuliani made more tempered appeals to liberal swing voters with polls showing the race too close to call but voters' unfavorable impressions of mr giuliani edging upward from the mayor s past broadsides , mr dinkins unleashed his harshest commercial of the campaign , using footage of mr giuliani s epithetspiked speech to a rowdy police rally near city hall last year and condemning him for excessive zeal as united states attorney in manhattan for his part , mr giuliani mixed apparent confidence with the acknowledgment that his voter support seems to suffer when he is too much on the offensive , and he steered away from direct attacks on mr dinkins a giuliani endorsement mr giuliani s new ads feature an endorsement from the rev dr john e brandon , a harlem minister and former head of the city s human rights commission , who says the republicanliberal nominee will bring us together around the issues of the economy , supporting small businesses and lifting people out of poverty and will be fair with everybody , bringing people together and not separating them in an appearance on wcbstv last night , mr giuliani took some pains to soften his earlier suggestion that the city should try to bar louis farrakhan from speaking at yankee stadium a stance that was considered to have hurt him with liberals the program was to have been a debate , but mr dinkins skipped it because the station refused to include the conservative party candidate , george j marlin , as the mayor wished page b2 a postponed appearance he has a right , unfortunately , from the point of view of the sensibilities of people , but fortunately for the first amendment , he has a right to express that viewpoint , mr giuliani said of mr farrakhan s appearance , originally proposed for this weekend but since postponed and i would protect farrakhan to the same extent as i 'd protect someone that i agree with in reminding new york voters of mr giuliani s speech at the police rally , mr dinkins used an issue that politicians had been predicting he would invoke , suggesting that the mayor intends to leave no hot button unpushed between now and election day he also began broadcasting another ad repeating past criticisms of mr giuliani for once opposing abortion rights before unequivocally backing them four years ago , and painting the republicanliberal candidate s proposals for reshaping city government as coldhearted a third commercial cites the endorsement of the mayor by newspapers ranging from the village voice to the forward , a newspaper aimed at jewish readers together , the mayor s twilight rally with president clinton at a queens union hall , an emotional gathering with the rev jesse jackson , former mayor andrew young of atlanta and other members of the clergy at city hall , new endorsements and street stumping in which each candidate sniped at the other from a distance marked the beginning of the end of their long battle it s easier to be a good president for new york city and new york state if you have a good partner in city hall and the statehouse , mr clinton told a cheering crowd of 800 unionists and democrats at the international brotherhood of electrical workers hall in flushing in his second visit there of this campaign referring to the procession of national democrats who have endorsed the mayor , he said we may not have the vote in new york , but we have a stake in new york how can america do well if new york state and new york city do n't do well \? the mayor , speaking in an unusually blunt and forceful style , again framed the contest as a partisan battle royal , insisting that it s time to turn back the broken politics of blame and shame , of code words and cold indifference later , in an hourlong appearance of his own on wcbsam radio , the mayor defended his insistence on including mr marlin in the debates , saying , there s not a question rudy giuliani could dream up that would measure up to the superior questions from the press corps that i 've faced for four years mr giuliani , campaigning at a center for the elderly in astoria and other stops in queens , dismissed mr dinkins s gaining of support from the president and celebrities like barbra streisand , saying , he s got to go hollywood because he s in very bad shape but perhaps none of the activity was more intense or potentially influential than the candidates' new commercials , which are now on the air so often that an average viewer will see each of the three dinkins ads three times the giuliani ads include one with him talking with minority students at bishop loughlin memorial high school in brooklyn , his alma mater raising questions campaign officials said mr dinkins planned to spend about half a million dollars on television time between now and tuesday , and mr giuliani somewhat more , though neither camp would disclose precise figures robert shrum , a mayoral media adviser , said the new ads raised more questions about mr giuliani s record , in keeping with the campaign s longstanding strategy we take nothing for granted we have never intended to take anything for granted , he said we 're simply showing mr giuliani and how he has behaved in some times when he was under pressure his entire campaign has turned into an apology for his past record , of saying , 'i did n't quite do it that way' in fact , i think his explanations have never helped him much viewed as distortion mr giuliani countered that the dinkins ads especially one that claims he has proposed city job cuts that would decimate services for senior citizens grossly distorted his views and that the mayor himself had initially proposed cuts in programs for the elderly earlier this year in the last days of the campaign , unfortunately in this campaign even in the early days , sometimes when people get desperate they spread a lot of false rumors and they try to frighten people , mr giuliani said seeking to counter the potential impact of former mayor edward i koch s endorsement of mr giuliani , nearly a dozen former city officials who served under mr koch came to city hall yesterday to endorse mr dinkins one who did not come but was listed as a dinkins supporter was bess myerson , the former miss america and friend of mr koch , whom mr giuliani unsucessfully prosecuted on charges of trying to improperly influence the judge presiding over her lover s divorce a difficult job the dinkins mayoralty now clearly exhibits the seasoned strength needed to lead us , said nathan leventhal , the president of lincoln center who was a deputy mayor under mr koch and director of mr dinkins s transition to office four years ago having served in government , we know how difficult the job can be , he said others who spoke included benjamin ward , the former police commissioner , who criticized mr giuliani for his participation in the raucous demonstration by the patrolmen s benevolent association the police brass and most of the police in this city are still embarrassed by what went on on these steps , he said and we know it will take perhaps several years for us to get over the reputation that the police union with the help of rudy giuliani caused it put us in a bad light in police circles all over the country photos as president clinton joined mayor david n dinkins yesterday at a rally in queens , rudolph w giuliani was the only candidate taking questions in a televised appearance that was to have been a debate \( wcbstv \)
when the nation s retailers locked their doors friday evening after a 29day holiday season that began the day after thanksgiving , many were relieved that a late surge of shopping would produce modestly respectable sales figures it was explosive the last few days before christmas , said walter f loeb , a consultant in new york who works with leading retailers customers were rushing to the stores kenneth a macke , the chairman and chief executive of the dayton hudson corporation in minneapolis , said , i feel better after this week than i did any of the preceeding weeks statistical data are hard to come by right after christmas , because different companies compile information for different periods and none are inclined to release precise numbers until the new year rough estimates of yeartoyear increases in holiday sales provided by store executives ranged from 7 to 9 percent at sears , roebuck company to 2 to 3 percent at federated department stores , whose properties include bloomingdale s , which did considerably better , but also abraham straus , jordan marsh , burdine s , rich s and stern s not always easy but even where sales were strong , they were not always easily achieved mr macke said he had never seen so much prechristmas pricecutting and promotions , which cut into profit margins , in his 30 years in the retailing business and duncan muir , a spokesman for the j c penney company , of dallas , confirmed that view with a lot of people shopping at last minute , we prepared for that with many special promotions , he said if this holiday season were a drawing , it would look like a hammock high sales right after thanksgiving and right before christmas , with two sagging weeks in between beyond that , it is hard to find patterns across the industry , home furnishings and small appliances had a very good season , executives and consultants said , but clothing did not that trend was bad news for many stores , because apparel provides a large chunk of their business , and also higher profit margins than many other goods bloomingdale s and sears , however , were pleased with their apparel sales all our sweaters , particularly cashmere , did very well , said michael gould , the president of bloomingdale s , while cosmetics and housewares also had strong seasons ann barkelew , a spokeswoman for dayton hudson , said that while sweaters also did well at their stores , the home area was definitely stronger than apparel , adding , so was holiday motif merchandise , like novelty ties for men and fashion watches with a christmas tree decoration that also play carols two particularly strong items , she said , were disneyrelated goods and the new mont blanc pen , called the hardwriter , which sold like wildfire despite its price of 165 to 185 one surprise was that shoppers in california seemed to hold their own with those elsewhere in the united states , even though that state s economy continues to struggle and tens of thousands of workers have been laid off in military contracting and other industries we had questions about the west coast , but our performance in the west was comparable to the rest of country , said john costello , senior vice president at sears , roebuck company s merchandise group and mr macke of dayton hudson said , california was equally busy as the rest of the chain making the estimates looking at their computers , most executives were able to come up with estimates of how they had done mr macke , whose stores include dayton s , hudson s , marshall field s , mervyn s and target , said he expected sales for december to show an increase over last year s figures of low to midsingle digits in percentage terms mr muir of j c penney said sales for the season were likely to grow by midsingle digits , while mr costello of sears was more sanguine , predicting that sales would rise roughly 7 to 9 percent , bolstered by doubledigit gains in some departments , including consumer electronics and tools wall street analysts who follow the retailing industry have generally predicted that apparel sales nationwide , among stores open at least a year , would rise no more than 3 percent during the holiday season , while sales of home furnishings , small appliances and electronics would rise as much as 8 percent the international council of shopping centers , a trade group in new york whose members include shopping center owners and managers , had predicted that holiday sales of home furnishings would rise 20 percent from last year s from the day after thanksgiving until last monday , the council said , sales at the nation s malls rose 44 percent presumably those numbers will be pushed up when the frenzy of the final week is added in stores were opening up at 7 or 8 in the morning and closing at midnight to catch any business they could the last week , said mr loeb , the consultant the most optimistic assessment of the holiday season came from michael gould , president of bloomingdale s we 've had a very good month so far , he said friday evening friday looked strong , thursday we had doubledigit gains compared with last year , and last saturday was colossal among the bestsellers , he said , were housewares , cosmetics and sweaters at bloomingdale s flagship store in midtown manhattan , he said apparel , especially men s wear , was selling better than at other bloomingdale s stores asked what a good holiday season portends for the new year , mr gould admonished you never look ahead at christmas is the customer overextending , or will they be so sated we do n't need anything special in the first quarter \? i ca n't tell
moscow , jan 28 diphtheria , an acutely infectious disease that has been practically eliminated in the west through regular immunization , is now spreading rapidly through russia , reaching what the world health organization calls epidemic proportions in the last two years , the number of people stricken by the disease has risen from 1 , 000 to 4 , 000 at the end of 1992 , according to estimates , with the numbers of new cases doubling from july to december it is also rising dangerously in ukraine , where more than 1 , 300 cases were reported in the first 10 months of last year , and cases are being reported in other former republics of the soviet union first reported mostly in russia s largest cities , moscow and st petersburg , which have more than 650 registered cases each , the disease is now showing up in the more distant regions , where doctors are even less likely to give a prompt and effective diagnosis , experts say from our point of view , it is an epidemic , said dr george oblapenko , acting regional adviser for communicable diseases at the who offices in denmark if you have 1 , 000 cases where you previously had 100 , then it is clearly another level of transmission it will take time to control it now , in a huge country like russia , to bring levels down to zero failings in program diphtheria is a highly contagious disease , transmitted by airborne bacteria , that may be spread in particles and produces a toxin that causes an inflammation of the heart and nervous system untreated , it progresses rapidly and can be fatal in a short period of time doctors say the initial symptoms are commonly confused with angina , or inflammation of the throat and chest most experts attribute the increase in diphtheria to failings in the russian immunization program , which allows a high number of infants to be turned down for the normal schedule of inoculations for medical reasons , while not keeping many adults , particularly those from age 20 to 50 , up to date on their immunizations but doctors also say the situation has been worsened by the social and economic upheavals that have sent thousands of people migrating across the former soviet union and slowed down the response of the health authorities to an increasing crisis people are on the move , mostly from the areas where the conflicts are , said the city of moscow s chief epidemiologist , igor a andreyev there is more mixing of the populations , and more carriers drifters , people who live in the subway tunnels it is part of the social problems created by the country s collapse , by the lack of social and political stability the number of diphtheria cases is also increasing in ukraine , which in the first 10 months of 1992 reported 1 , 344 cases the last official number for russia is 3 , 278 as of november 1992 , but with the number of new cases rising at more than 500 a month , it was expected to pass 4 , 000 at year s end rising in neighboring lands the number of cases is also on the rise , but at a slower rate , in the neighboring countries of lithuania , moldova and belarus in belarus , 13 new cases were reported last year in one city alone , for a nationwide total of 44 , who figures show in other countries the number of cases is relatively insignificant altogether , the former republics of the soviet union account for more than 90 percent of all the diphtheria cases in europe , mr oblapenko said the last big outbreak in europe occurred in sweden in the 1970 s , he said , but then the number of cases never surpassed 20 if we take the figures for moscow , and apply them to the population of the united states , we would have a major health crisis on our hands , said murray feshbach , an expert on health conditions in the former soviet union who visited here recently as it is , he said , the current number of diphtheria cases registered in the united states is four the who reported one case in france in 1991 , two cases in germany in that year , one case in italy and none in spain regular booster shots in most developed countries , children are immunized at an early age , with booster shots administered regularly until the age of 12 or so dr myles druckman , chief medical doctor at the american medical center in moscow , said adults in the united states were fully immunized , given the thoroughness of the american system of inoculations he said he did not advise americans visiting or working in russia to get new vaccines although the clinic has made shots available to resident foreigners here who want them in the soviet union , regular immunization against diphtheria began only in the early 1960 s , after which the incidence of diphtheria fell sharply , from a high of 53 , 000 in 1960 to fewer than 200 in the mid70 s according to dr oblapenko , the reemergence of diphtheria in russia and its neighbors , and the speed of its outbreak , are unusual most of those stricken with the disease are adults 73 percent many of them in highrisk professions like bus or streetcar drivers , cafeteria workers and others who are in constant contact with the public dr andreyev in moscow said the city government , which recently held a special session to discuss the problem , was now requiring employees to show vaccination certificates before being hired at new jobs fatalities are high as the disease continues to spread 57 cases were reported this year in the provincial city of tver the fatality rate has also been remarkably high , the world health organization says in russia last year , 110 people , including 39 children , died of the disease according to elena kotova , deputy chief of administration at the state committee for epidemiological control , none of the children who died had been vaccinated in recent years , the public s faith in vaccination has been badly shaken after a series of published reports about the risks of poorquality vaccines , and dirty needles in addition , russian doctors are quicker than their western counterparts to refuse to vaccinate small children , for fear it will compound other health problems there are children whose mothers refuse to let them be vaccinated , mrs kotova said but there are also children who are weak , with chronic illnesses , who are born with defects , who are refused by pediatricians there are many medical reasons not to immunize , more so here than abroad , but maybe our children are weaker as a result , according to a world health organization report , only 47 percent of infants in russia less than a year old were immunized against diphtheria in 1991 , compared with a high immunization rate of 80 percent for the same age group in the 1980 s at the state committee of epidemiological control , the equivalent of the centers for disease control and prevention , the united states federal agency , experts said the immunization levels for the population as a whole had dropped to 68 percent in 1991 after a team visited the region in the spring of 1991 , the organization sent what was then the soviet ministry of health a report , with recommendations to start an extensive publicrelations campaign to alert the population to the dangers of avoiding vaccination in the meantime , the soviet union collapsed , the soviet health ministry along with it , and the newly enlarged russian health ministry took time to emerge in its place as the numbers began to rise this year , moscow and st petersburg began largescale immunization campaigns according to one report , st petersburg more than doubled the number of vaccinations administered last year but foreign experts say they have been disappointed by the russian health authorities' slow and somewhat laborious response
wimbledon , england , june 22 less than a week ago , pete sampras raised his cherished serving arm in the rather mundane act of brushing his teeth and discovered his shoulder was too sore to help him carry brush to mouth how could it launch a serve worthy of a wimbledon campaign \? three days of frenetic treatment and diagnoses ensued , and on the eve of his match against the australian neil borwick , sampras was still concerned that he might suffer tendon damage by pursuing the one grand slam title for which he s been groomed for the last decade sampras would love to further validate his ranking as the world s no 1 player by winning what the tournament traditionalists consider the epitome of the genre but today sampras sauntered onto court 1 on schedule and sauntered away none the worse for wear after a 67 \( 810 \) , 63 , 76 \( 73 \) , 63 victory that lasted more than two and a half hours opts to receive so wary about his service prowess that he elected to have the 121stranked

to rise to an occasion he 'd expected to miss i just came out today and was a bit nervous , kind of unsure of myself , said sampras i felt like i was n't prepared , like walking into an exam without studying sampras dropped out of high school to study full time on the men s circuit , a decision that helped him become , at 19 , the youngest men s champion of the united states open in 1990 today , his unease and lack of practice evaporated as the match went on i was n't exactly going for aces on every serve like i usually do , he said , but under the circumstances i thought i played pretty well

24yearold german , referring only to her health graf s tormenter graf did encounter problems with an unruly german spectator at centre court the unidentified man first made his presence known to her

deranged fan of graf s who wanted to help her regain the top ranking from seles , is also german graf has made it clear that the injury to seles disturbed her all the more for its being generated by a fan who claimed to be acting on her behalf today graf reacted with disgust when she again heard the abusive spectator hectoring her , this time to accuse her of faking her foot injury oh my god , not him again , said graf , who asked the chair umpire , jane tabor , to summon referee alan mills the spectator was later detained by the police and by tournament officials , who released him after

ardsley at an hour when most elementary school students are still rubbing the sleepy dust from their eyes and scrambling to make the school bus on time , 10yearold tracy green and her 7yearold brother , david , are already engrossed in a board game at the ardsley children s center at the concord road elementary school several children are reviewing the previous day s homework assignments as they sprawl on a rug in front of a picture window , while others sit quietly and read in a brightly lighted corner down the hall in the cafeteria , eight boys from second through fourth grade are playing frisbee with soft foam disks , while a cluster of kindergarten and firstgrade girls compare the toys they have brought in their backpacks more of the waking day at school during a time when educators , industrialists and politicians debate the benefits of expanding the school day and increasing the academic year , many children are already spending a significant part of their waking day at school , albeit not always in academic pursuits the school day may officially start at 8 30 am and run until 3 pm in most districts , but for increasing numbers of westchester youngsters , it is not uncommon to be at school from 7 30 am to nearly 6 pm sometimes we assume that a child is grownup if he goes to school , said sally ziegler , executive director of the child care council of westchester , based in white plains schoolage child care is an essential family support , and it s wonderful to see how it has grown in the last 10 years as the economy got crunchier , more people had to work once women had the freedom to use these centers , even on a dropoff basis , they could move into a working life in even the most affluent westchester bedroom communities , twocareer couples are becoming increasingly the norm rather than the exception the cost of a fulltime housekeeper may be prohibitive for many families , and even those who can afford weekly salaries of , say , 200 to 300 often prefer to have their children spend their time in the more social setting of an afterschool center for other parents , afterschool center fees , which range from about 190 to 250 a month for a fiveday program , are reasonable enough to justify their staying on the job constantly increasing enrollment parents who have to catch the 7 57 am train to manhattan or return home two hours after the school day ends may be reluctant to rely on baby sitters or neighbors to get children to school in the morning or meet a school bus in the afternoon in most cases grandparents or other family members are not available to help with child care i have found that the enrollment is constantly increasing , said julie fraitag , executive director of the ardsley children s center , which has served as a model for other centers there s a great need we started with 10 children in 1981 and now have 140 children registered the ardsley children s center serves students in kindergarten through fourth grade , and last fall it started a program in the district s middle school for fifth and sixth graders whether these centers provide beforeschool and afterschool services , operate on school holidays or during vacation breaks , they are often necessary to fill in the gaps between a parent s work schedule and the school calendar the programs serve families with a wide range of incomes and include private school programs like the hackley school s in tarrytown they offer children a structured afternoon of recreational and educational activities as well as providing a safe and quiet place to be until parents return from work some centers will escort children to and from afterschool clubs or meet them at churches in several communities with halfday kindergartens , the centers also offer parents an opportunity to have their children in a fullday setting with stimulating activities for example , the 10yearold chappaqua children s workshop has 83 percent of enrolled kindergartners in its program , said jill stewart , executive director of the workshop we definitely felt the need for an allday program , she said first and foremost , we are here for working parents who need to have their children in an enriching educational program for more than two and a half hours a day there s a symbiotic relationship between the kindergarten program and our program we reinforce the skills of the chappaqua kindergarten program jane arcaya , director of the dobbs ferry afterschool center , said , society and the community have to catch up with the fact that parents are working the reliability factor and because both are working , parents must be able to count on their children s being taken care of for parents , the biggest factor is reliability , said shelly levin , director of the children s corner in larchmont , which serves 150 children in kindergarten through sixth grade the biggest anxiety is that the sitter wo n't show up , she said some parents also do n't like it if the kids are at home with a sitter , watching tv and playing nintendo , and not learning how to use their leisure time in a healthy way
charlotte , nc , may 16 the charlotte hornets said all the right things after today s loss they said they would n't give up they said they believed they could win three consecutive games against the knicks but losing game 4 was a damaging blow for the hornets not only are they one game from elimination , but new york s defense appeared to frustrate the hornets , who scored a serieslow 92 points today had the hornets won today , they would have entered tuesday s game with momentum now , they have no room for error down 31 going to new york is a tough task , but coming back from that and winning the series is all the incentive you need , said hornets forward larry johnson there s no question we can play with them every game we have played in this series could have gone either way there are eight teams left struggling for a title , and none of them are just going to lay down no big plays but if the hornets do not win this series , they will be haunted by their inablity to make big plays as often as the knicks the hornets lost a 12point lead in game 1 , they squandered an 8point fourthquarter lead late in game 2 and they could not stop blackman s gamewinning shot today the hornets have not had one game in which their offense has clicked on all cylinders dell curry \( 12 points \) and kendall gill \( 21 points \) finally ended their offensive slumps today , but alonzo mourning \( 12 points \) had his worst game of the series meanwhile , the hornets' uptempo offense has not worn down the knicks the way charlotte had hoped foul trouble limited muggsy bogues to 14 minutes in the first half , and the hornets missed bogues s ball pressure the knicks methodically opened up a 15point lead , and today s contest had a halfcourt tempo , the style new york plays best the hornets rarely got a fast break unless it was off a steal or a turnover new york respect still , the hornets have earned new york s respect in this series and now that the knicks have escaped charlotte with a 31 lead , they have no intention of returning to town this season if you think about it , the series could easily be 22 , 31 them , or 40 either way , said knicks forward anthony mason every game has been fought hard and could have gone either way they 're a great team that plays hard , but i do n't think we 've played knick basketball , yet we 've got a 31 lead i do n't expect them to give up but i know we can play better that makes me feel good photo charles smith , who scored 19 points yesterday , battling the hornets' larry johnson \( robert willett for the new york times \)
jerusalem , oct 19 in a gesture to the palestine liberation organization that was seen as a harbinger of a possible mass release of prisoners , israel today freed the palestinian prisoner it has held the longest , 23 years it was the first release since the agreement on palestinian autonomy signed last month israeli officials called it a confidencebuilding measure that could increase support for the accord in the occupied territories palestinians said the prisoner , salim alzreii , 50 , had been a commander in the mainstream fatah group of yasir arafat and was considered the leader of the nearly 11 , 000 palestinians held in israeli jails mr arafat had reportedly asked prime minister yitzhak rabin to release mr zreii , who had been sentenced to life imprisonment in 1970 after being caught trying to infiltrate into israel by sea the defense ministry said mr zreii had escaped in 1969 from the gaza strip , where he had carried out several attacks on soldiers , though none were hurt , and had killed a palestinian and planned other slayings since the plo in tunis has not carried out terrorist attacks since the signing of the agreement , mr zreii could be freed , said oded benami , a spokesman for the defense ministry after mr zreii s release at the northern end of the gaza strip , he was given a hero s welcome by hundreds of palestinians at his home town of deir albalah men carried him on their shoulders , chanting god is great ! as women cheered and clapped two uniformed members of the fatah hawks , an armed group , hugged him and fired their weapons in the air our main aim is peace , mr zreii told reporters this peace deal is the first step forward to achieve the palestinian goal the plo and its supporters in the territories have been pressing israel for a largescale release families of the prisoners have demonstrated almost daily , and palestinian newspapers have carried reports of an imminent release such a release will contribute to a better atmosphere and greater support among the palestinian people in the west bank and gaza strip , said ahmad tibi , an adviser to mr arafat who negotiated mr zreii s release plea for leader of hamas dr tibi , an israeli arab , said he had also given mr rabin a request from mr arafat for the release of sheik ahmad yassin , leader of the militant islamic group hamas the plo wants mr yassin set free to widen support for the agreement and to undercut hamas s criticism of it mr rabin has said that large numbers of prisoners would be freed , but he added that details still had to be decided by security officials and by palestinian and israeli negotiators on selfrule in the gaza strip and jericho the talks are to resume on wednesday it is expected that palestinians imprisoned for relatively light offenses , like participation in nationalist protests or membership in banned political organizations , will be freed quickly those convicted of killing or wounding israelis will probably not be freed leaders of the opposition likud party accused the government of making onesided concessions that would encourage more arab attacks it shows that jews can be murdered , and the perpetrators can then return like heroes from the israeli jails , said uzi landau , a likud parliament member
an 11yearold sullivan county girl who fell ill on an upstate camping trip last month and died of a viral brain infection two days later was the first rabies fatality in new york state in nearly 40 years , state health officials said yesterday , confirming fears that had been expressed days before the girl , kelly ahrendt of bloomingburg , ny , died at the westchester county medical center on july 11 in the midst of a record epidemic of rabies among wild animals , particularly raccoons , in new york state and other parts of the northeast but much about the case remained a mystery extensive tests showed that rabies was the cause of death , but the officials said it was unclear how the girl contracted the disease rabies is ordinarily transmitted by an infected animal s bite or scratch , but there was no evidence that kelly had been bitten or scratched , the officials said my daughter was aware of rabies in our area and knew what to watch out for , the victim s mother , margaret ahrendt , said in a telephone interview last night we do n't know how she got this , and we may never know it s very frightening to think that your child could pick this up without being bitten or scratched although the case was not cited as a cause for undue alarm , health officials noted that rabies was deadly , and they urged caution around raccoons and other wild animals they also renewed warnings about the epidemic , which has spread through the middle atlantic states over the last 16 years and has now crept over the new york metropolitan region and moved into upstate new york and connecticut this tragic death illustrates the serious public health threat posed by the current epidemic of rabies in raccoons and other wild animals , the state health commissioner , dr mark r chassin , said in announcing the results of laboratory findings on the girl s death at a news conference in albany it is vital that all children be taught not to approach or touch any wild animal , he said , particularly one that is acting strangely or wandering around a residential neighborhood pet owners must also get their pets vaccinated against rabies no one had died of rabies in new york state since 1954 , dr chassin said and while many people scratched or bitten by animals are treated for possible exposure , the last known case of human rabies in the state occurred in 1977 , and that involved exposure in a laboratory state health officials had not named the victim in the rabies case , but the times heraldrecord of middletown identified her yesterday kelly was one of eight children of richard and margaret ahrendt , who live on a small farm in bloomingburg , in the catskill mountains eight miles north of middletown mrs ahrendt said kelly , who would have been a sixth grader this fall at cristell middle school in pine bush , ny , fell ill on a family camping trip in saratoga county on july 9 as her symptoms progressed from headache , fever and muscle aches to neurological disorders , she was treated at saratoga hospital in saratoga springs and later at horton memorial hospital in middletown before being moved to the westchester county medical center in valhalla mrs ahrendt said kelly had never complained of any animal bite or scratch on july 8 , just before the family left on the camping trip , mrs ahrendt said she took kelly to a pediatrician because she had complained of an ache in her left arm and shoulder it was no big deal , mrs ahrendt said we thought she had done it exercising outside we did n't connect it to anything the pediatrician said it was a muscle problem he also found she had a slight ear infection and strep throat he prescribed antibiotics and said it was ok to go on vacation mrs ahrendt said the family blamed no one for kelly s death the symptoms were too vague for any doctor to analyze we understand that , she said we do n't hold anyone responsible dr chassin stressed that the family obtained treatment promptly and that healthcare workers handled the case properly so far , dr chassin said , members of the girl s family and about 20 healthcare workers have begun receiving preventive treatment , which consists of a dose of rabies immune globulin and five doses of vaccine over a month he said there was no risk to anyone who had casual contact with the girl before she became ill because rabies is only transmitted through broken skin or mucous membrane exposure to infected saliva health workers alerted pathologists at the medical center discovered evidence of rabies during a routine autopsy , concluding that the girl had died of viral encephalitis , a brain inflammation rabies is one of several medical conditions that can cause such an inflammation further tests since wednesday confirmed the presence of the rabies virus it was not until thursday , after some news reports suggested rabies was suspected , that kelly s family was told of the possibility at that time , health officials recommended as a precaution that the family and healthcare workers at the three hospitals where the girl was treated should be evaluated for potential exposure to saliva or brain tissue that could carry the virus dr chassin said investigators would continue to search for the source of infection none of the animals on the ahrendt farm chickens , ducks , horses , cats and a dog are suspected , officials said when a person is bitten or scratched by a rabid animal , the virus entering the human body seeks out nerves and travels along the central nervous system to the brain no symptoms appear until it reaches the brain , and the time between exposure and development of symptoms can vary from a few days to six months , depending on the nature and location of the bite or scratch untreated rabies is always fatal and treatment is ineffective after symptoms appear , so health experts say it is vital to get treatment as soon as rabies is suspected dr chassin , calling the current epidemic unprecedented , said that new york state last year set a national record for the greatest number of rabid animals ever reported , 1 , 761 , and that 1 , 088 new yorkers had been treated for possible exposure to rabies in 1992 in 1989 , before the epidemic reached the state , only 54 rabid animals were reported and 81 people were treated for exposure
boston of all the recent setbacks for american foreign policy , none is as damaging to president clinton s credibility as the humiliation in haiti events there raise urgent questions for him as for us about the quality of the advice he is getting , and of his own leadership the excuses offered for failure in bosnia and somalia are not available in haiti one cannot say , as is said of american inaction on the bosnian genocide , that the first responsibility is europe s mr clinton did not , as in somalia , inherit an illthoughtout policy from president bush in haiti the clinton administration created its own policy to restore democracy by negotiation with the military usurpers it convened the talks on governors island and pressed for the agreement reached there in july it undertook to guarantee the agreed formula for the return of president aristide on oct 30 then , when a ragtag gang of armed thugs demonstrated against the landing of us and canadian soldiers , mr clinton and his aides panicked instead of leaving the troopship there and telling the haitian military to call off its goons , the administration sent the ship away the message to the military rulers in haiti was unmistakable you can push us around easily the united states government is so afraid of its public opinion after somalia that even you can intimidate it then there is the message to the brave haitians who have stepped forward to oppose the military robert malval , a businessman , agreed to be prime minister at the personal urging of president clinton and vice president gore are he and his colleagues now to be left vulnerable to the killers \? a respected diplomat in haiti , not american , said of the decision to turn the troopship around it was a scandal , an idiocy it just pulled the rug out keep the ship there as a symbol of keeping pressure on the military the analogy with somalia is ridiculous over all , haitians are united in wanting democracy sitting on top are a tiny , tiny group of thugs who are no longer even united with the business elite there s no real military force , just a rabble how did it go so wrong \? the fault lay not in the policy but in the competence , or rather the incompetence , of its execution the clinton policy on haiti was sound the united states has an interest , put most narrowly , in stopping the flow of refugees from haiti president bush sought to do that by using navy ships to interdict the fleeing people the clinton administration saw that the wiser policy was to seek a legitimate government in haiti the administration got support for negotiation from the organization of american states and the united nations it brought in canada , france and venezuela as coguarantors of the governors island agreement but the administration failed to deal with pentagon concerns about getting troops into haiti and assuring their safety it turned out that the concerns were justified there was also a staggering failure of intelligence in the weeks before the aborted landing , american correspondents in haiti wrote about rising violence and the threat to the diplomatic solution but the us embassy poohpoohed the stories , criticizing the journalists for writing negative articles perhaps the us diplomats were conditioned by years of downplaying the horrors of haiti in order to vitiate haitian refugees' claims for asylum clinton officials should in any event have known better than to expect honor from the haitian military when the crisis came , the president s top cabinet and white house aides were evidently traumatized by fear of another somalia no one had the independence or courage to say to mr clinton you 've got to hold your ground the american public is in a mood of extraordinary timidity about the use of power but the way for a president to deal with that , when he has a sound policy to carry out , is to exercise leadership to explain the us interest and the reasons for action bill clinton needs some advisers on foreign and defense policy who are not shy about telling him straight what has to be done and he needs to understand that it is not enough for a president to analyze all the options , however brilliantly as harry truman understood , he has to decide
washington , sept 6 congress will return from vacation on tuesday to confront the heaviest variety of complex legislative issues it has faced in many years , while hoping to improve its standing with the public by seeking solutions to the nation s toughest problems none of this fall s issues may prove to be as challenging as the budget bill , which barely passed in both houses last month but the vote on the north american free trade agreement may be as close , and the health care overhaul may be even more complicated , even though both may well attract a level of bipartisan cooperation all but unseen in the 103d congress heavy fall schedule the scope of the agenda awes many lawmakers even without health and trade , congress will have a heavy fall schedule with commitments to act on these issues additional spending cuts , which will be needed because in august congressional leaders fell 4 billion short of their goal of 500 billion in deficit reduction crime and handgun control , which will be back after a republican filibuster killed the legislation in the senate last year the house passed the measure 205 to 203 in 1991 campaign finance , with neither party wanting to give the other any possible advantage and incumbents generally seeing the current system as satisfactory because it elected them procedural changes within congress itself , but like legislation on lobbying and campaign spending , this seems to many legislators like pandering to noisy reformers immigration , but while there is widespread agreement on the need to tighten up on phony claims of asylum , the agreement begins to unravel with the tugs of civil liberties claims the priority list does not stop there the savings and loan cleanup still needs money the extension on unemployment benefits is about to expire republicans fear that education legislation is aimed at too much national control and abortion is almost certain to cause sharp legislative battles one reason the 103d congress faces so many contentious issues is that once the clinton administration was in office , congress quickly disposed of the easy ones all the bills that it had agreed on last year but that president george bush had vetoed , like family leave and simplified voter registration once the senate passes the final version of the national service bill on tuesday or wednesday , representative barbara b kennelly of connecticut , a chief deputy whip , said , i do n't think anything easy is left , even appropriations representative dan rostenkowski , the illinois democrat who heads the ways and means committee , worries that if all the clinton administration priorities are acted on , you 're going to have us fighting battles all over the congressional map drowning other issues \? attracting sufficient public attention for issues beyond trade and health is the frequently voiced congressional concern among those expressing concern is representative charles e schumer , a brooklyn democrat who is seeking action on crime , immigration and access to abortion clinics i just hope the whirlpools of nafta and health care wo n't drown everything else , he said one of the capital s serious students of congress , thomas e mann of the brookings institution , said he thought legislators might be selling themselves short mr mann said that while it would have been impossible to do the budget and health care simultaneously , the current agenda is not too big congress can walk and chew gum at the same time , he said the congress always handles many things at once although the media is all hyped to the story of 'overload , ' mr mann said , congress is a decentralized body , capable of processing a whole lot of things at once an internal view of the problem of overload was offered by the senate majority leader , george j mitchell of maine , who said last week that he had just returned from climbing maine s milehigh mount katahdin you were up so high and it was so forbidding , mr mitchell said , so if you looked beyond the next rock , you might not take a step he said the lesson that veteran climbers gave him to take back to the senate was , take it one step and one handhold at a time if republicans are true to their word , some of the steps this fall may prove less slippery than the legislative terrain mr mitchell had to tramp through this spring and summer with president clinton s economic stimulus and budget bills senator bob dole of kansas , the minority leader , said homestate residents he had been talking with were pleased that we have some issues we may work together on the trade agreement is one representative robert h michel of illinois , the house minority leader , said of the pact , the president can count on more support on our side than his side it is more than an opportunity to appear cooperative , although republicans have been concerned that their antagonism to many clinton programs was stamping them as obstructionists the trade agreement , basically negotiated by mr bush , is a measure that republicans can approach with enthusiasm senator john c danforth , republican of missouri , said that the last six months were a real downer , but that the trade agreement would show it s a good thing to have republicans engaged in the business of governing
berlin , june 5 after more than a decade of intensive research , scientists boast that they have learned more faster about hiv , the virus that causes aids , than about any other microbe yet to hivinfected patients and the public , the scientists' wealth of knowledge contrasts sharply with the poverty of clinical benefits it has yielded the most impressive gains in fighting aids have been made in treating the opportunistic infections that develop as the immune system collapses of the drugs developed to combat hiv directly , none cure aids or even contain it for long there is no vaccine to prevent hiv infection the aids epidemic is spreading at an alarming rate in asia and many other areas of the world in many underdeveloped countries , aids patients fill the vast majority of hospital beds 14 million now infected the world health organization says 14 million people in the world are now infected with the virus , the overwhelming majority having been infected through heterosexual sex and as educational and preventive efforts falter , the epidemic s future looks even bleaker the number of those infected will rise to between 30 million and 40 million by 2000 , who predicts with that background , the ninth international aids meeting , which begins here on sunday , seeks a breakthrough in the battle against aids but the probability is high that the 12 , 000 participants will leave at the end of the week with mountains of new data and no solution to the major questions , many of which have stumped specialists since aids was discovered in 1981 these are some of the questions why do some individuals remain uninfected despite repeated sexual contact with infected individuals \? is there an unknown factor in the immune system that allows some people to fend off the virus \? if so , what is it \? what laboratory test is the best measure of disease progression \? why is there so much variation in the time it takes to develop aids after infection with hiv \? the average period is considered to be 10 years , but some people progress to aids within a year or two while others go for more than a decade without developing serious symptoms is the variation due to random chance or to some undetected genetic , environmental or behavioral factor \? which of the two arms of the immune system the one that produces antibodies or the one that uses mechanisms produced by immune cells is more important in producing vaccineinduced immunity \? and what laboratory test best measures protection from experimental vaccines \? kaposi s sarcoma was a rare cancer before it became common in people with aids why has it so overwhelmingly affected gay men , but rarely women , children and recipients of transfused blood \? kaposi s sarcoma has apparently decreased in incidence in the last few years why \? is it caused by a virus other than hiv \? why is it that chimpanzees can be infected with hiv but do not get sick from aids \? infection with sexually transmitted diseases like syphilis and chancroid vastly increase the risk of acquiring hiv through sex are there other cofactors that enhance transmission \? once infection is established , do microbes like the ones called mycoplasma act as cofactors to speed up progression of the disease \? will hiv eventually mutate into a less harmful virus , or into one that might be even more communicable \? how does hiv cause the immune system to collapse \? scientists invited to respond to a recent survey by science magazine said that question was the biggest puzzle of all in the beginning the aids epidemic appeared just as scientists were making some crucial discoveries about the immune system when aids struck , a new research test showed that hiv s chief target was the cd4 cell , the special immune cell in the blood studies also showed that the virus enters the cd4 cell through a particular site on its surface the aids epidemic vividly documented what scientists had suspected , that the cd4 cell was the conductor of the immunological orchestra dr robert c gallo , a codiscoverer of hiv at the national cancer institute in bethesda , md , is expected to tell the berlin meeting about what he believes may be a new way to treat aids based partly on what scientists are still learning about the cd4 sites scientists have recently discovered a new and apparently harmless virus , hhv7 dr gallo s team has found that both hhv7 and hiv use the same site on cd4 cells to infect the cells it is the first time that two kinds of human viruses have been shown to share the same receptor site on a cell dr gallo said in an interview that his team had shown that hhv7 blocks entry of the aids virus into the cd4 cell and had started a crash program to identify the part of hhv7 that is responsible for infecting cells and an ultimate aim would be to use one virus to fight another in humans dr gallo s findings , like those that many other scientists will report in berlin , whether big or small , are likely to raise even more questions because that is the nature of research what initially seems like a big advance often evaporates with the next series of experiments yet what may seem like a trivial incremental advance may , overnight , open doors that no one had seen the virus how it behaves , and how it mutates

washington , jan 18 presidentelect bill clinton , whose penchant for verbosity has cast a cloud over each of the crucial speeches in his career , is working to craft an inaugural address that is trenchant , uplifting and , if he can manage it , succinct this time , his aides said , a premium is being placed on brevity inaugural planners have scheduled 20 minutes for the wednesday address , but few have forgotten mr clinton s previous turns in the national speechmaking limelight at two successive democratic national conventions mr clinton , who can be a compelling public speaker , has often tried to stuff dozens of themes into one important speech the result is that he stumbled twice when the pressure of history was upon him in 1988 , he delivered a ponderous 33minute speech nominating michael s dukakis for president it is remembered mainly for the cheers that greeted the phrase , in conclusion in july , the speech he delivered accepting his own nomination dragged on 20 minutes longer than the 1988 talk as he freighted it down with every signal he wanted to send this time , fewer cooks the problem with the convention speech was that too many people got their hands on it , said one clinton adviser by most accounts , mr clinton has spent whatever spare time he has had in the past week working by himself on the inaugural speech aides said he would probably rehearse his first draft in front of a teleprompter all of his advisers profess to know little about its contents the music is playing in his mind , said george stephanopoulos , mr clinton s communications director mr clinton s chief speech writers are david kusnet , who will perform that task at the white house and is the author of speaking american how the democrats can win in the nineties , and michael waldman , a former director of public citizen , a watchdog group founded by ralph nader none of mr clinton s advisers will guarantee as they did at the convention in july that the speech will meet the 20minute limit i would think the remarks would certainly not exceed that , harry thomason , the inaugural producer , said i think he can but then he added , the parade always starts late father healy s guidance mr clinton has received advice from aides and supporters in the form of memos he said today that he is also drawing from a fourpage outline that was discovered among the personal effects of the rev timothy healy , the head of the new york public library and former georgetown university president who died three weeks ago so , tim s buried down the hill here , and i know he s looking down at us , and i want him to know that i have absorbed the instructions , and i have taken some and rejected some , mr clinton said in remarks at georgetown university that was always the case mr clinton has been reviewing the inaugural speeches of past presidents , paying special attention , his aides said , to abraham lincoln s second inaugural address , which was brief and dwelled on ruminations over the civil war mr clinton is mindful of several objectives he wants to accomplish among other things , mr clinton hopes the speech , which he will deliver after he takes the oath of office wednesday afternoon , will reach republicans and voters who favored ross perot he will also try to use the speech to set a tone for his administration that distills his campaign rhetoric into a formula for governing
mexico city , nov 1 defending his government against rising criticism , president carlos salinas de gortari today pledged civility and fairness in national elections next year and promised his opponents full freedom to present their cases to the people in his annual stateofthenation address mr salinas said he would not go beyond the changes to political statutes that his institutional revolutionary party pushed through the legislature in september those changes have been criticized as grossly inadequate by many critics , although they were eventually endorsed by the conservative opposition in congress but mr salinas went further than he has before in answering opposition leaders who have warned that after 64 years in power the governing party is gearing up for a noholdsbarred effort to retain the presidency for an additional sixyear term i offer the diverse political forces and the contenders who will take part in the electoral contest full respect , abidance to the terms of the law and proper conditions for them to present their options to the mexicans in full freedom , mr salinas said issue in us congress the political conduct of the government and its party have come under harsh attack after a series of incidents in which they have been accused of trying to censor critics and discredit a leftist leader , cuauhtemoc cardenas , who is expected to be the sole strong opposition candidate in the presidential vote in august the shortcomings of the political system have also flowered as an issue in the united states congressional debate over the north american free trade agreement with the accord expected to go to a vote in the house of representatives as early as nov 17 , some american legislators are arguing that mexico should have fair elections if it is to be in a freetrade zone with the united states and canada responding to pressure to allow foreign observers in the vote mr salinas said only the mexicans should be the definitive watchmen reflecting his government s deep concern that the trade agreement might be voted down in washington , mr salinas sought again to play down the importance of the pact , stressing the availability of trade and investment partners in europe and asia it should be noted once again that its benefits will not be forthcoming in the short term , mr salinas said of the proposed treaty nor will they produce spectacular results obliging tradition , mr salinas said nothing of the secretive process by which he will soon announce his choice of the governing party s presidential candidate in the past , the incumbent s nomination has been tantamount to election , and any of the senior officials considered to be strong contenders would probably be favored over mr cardenas but mr salinas s threehour address will nonetheless be sifted for apparent clues about his choice some prominent contenders some political commentators thought that mayor manuel camacho solis of mexico city received a particularly strong pat on the back through mentions of the soundness of municipal finances , a new children s museum and other projects but other commentators saw tacit endorsements of finance secretary pedro aspe or education secretary ernesto zedillo and none of the commentators seemed ready to downgrade luis donaldo colosio , the secretary of social development defending his administration against criticism of its economic policies , mr salinas cited statistics showing that poverty had declined , an assertion that some economists dispute he said inflation had been the most insidious force in concentrating wealth inflation fell to an annualized rate of 8 percent from 517 percent in the year that he took office , mr salinas said he argued that the emergence of big conglomerates and a new elite from his privatization of state companies did not mean further poverty for the poor the heart of the message , though , was a promise of civility in the contest ahead and a call to his supporters and opponents to unite in a committed effort to hold clear , transparent and exemplary elections , to join in a political pact of civility within the framework of the law some opposition leaders , particularly those on the left , dismissed the pledge , noting that the governing party would still be able to influence election boards , dominate television advertising and shape the first limits on campaign spending where the governing party has traditionally depended on backchannel financing from the state , it can also now collect individual contributions of more than 650 , 000 a year from executives and others who depend on government support he did n't talk about free elections , the president of mr cardenas s democratic revolutionary party , senator porfirio munoz ledo , said he talked about civility , about kissing our grandmothers on the cheek the question is whether his government will agree to accept an opposition victory and minimal conditions of equity in the campaign photo president carlos salinas de gortari of mexico yesterday in mexico city after his annual stateofthenation address \( reuters \)

in the architecture of renzo piano , we glide through tubes of neverending space mr piano s buildings may have finite dimensions , but they open boundless prospects paris spreads out before visitors as they ascend the escalator inside a transparent cylinder clipped to the side of the pompidou center at kansai airport , a project now under construction on an artificial island off the coast of japan , peoplemovers will convey travelers along the gleaming metal spine of a terminal building more than a mile in length these and other celestial transports , or at least tabletop versions of them , are on view in renzo piano building workshop selected projects , an exhibition at the urban center the show , organized by the architectural league , uses models , photographs , drawings and handson computer terminals to affirm that mr piano is our great poet of circulation many architects in this century have dreamed of adapting the static condition of architecture to the mobility of modern life none have come closer than renzo piano to realizing this ambition sometimes , as in his ibm traveling pavilion \( 198284 \) , mr piano s structures actually move more often , as at kansai airport and in the subway stations designed for his native genoa in 1983 , the rhythm of mr piano s gently curved trusses induces a hypnotic deep space toward which eye and body are irresistibly drawn these structures are urban arcades for the global city distended , late 20thcentury versions of the 19th century s ironandglass shopping arcades in a world of contracting distances , they display space as something to savor and they express the hope that far from contaminating the environment , urbanization will leave gossamer traces as lovely as a spider s web or a sandpiper s tracks in sand analogies with nature are apt mr piano aims for an ideal harmony between the natural world and human technology at kansai airport , the contours of the terminal roof were partly determined by patterns of wind elsewhere , mr piano has fashioned struts from bamboo poles fitted with metal joints those who associate mr piano with the aggressive high tech of the pompidou center \( designed from 197177 in collaboration with richard rogers \) may be surprised by a more recent paris project , a lowcost housing complex on the rue de meaux \( 198791 \) whose walls , clad in panels of warm terra cotta , enclose a verdant courtyard soft tech better describes mr piano s characteristic emphasis on the curving line , the folded plane , the combination of new materials with wood and stone the british architecture critic peter buchanon has noted the affinity between this approach and that of art nouveau designers a century ago mr piano s renovation of fiat s lingotto automobile factory in turin weaves together additional historical influences the futurist fascination with speed before world war i , and the megastructural ambitions of archigram and other avantgarde design groups in the 60 s mr piano s work is sometimes criticized for giving technology too benign a face some feel that to view technology within the tradition of western humanism is to deny the machine nightmares that have unfolded since the utopian visions of early 20thcentury modernists others object that the very idea of humanism has been perverted beyond redemption , not least by postmodern trivializations of the classical style but mr piano does not claim that technology is inherently humanistic he shows how it could be so and there may be no more powerful critique of corrupted humanism than the skill and determination with which mr piano has transcended corruption oddly , for an architect whose work celebrates freedom of movement , mr piano has designed an exhibition to be viewed sitting down it is a striking installation , set up on long wooden tables , surrounded by director s chairs with bright red seats models , photographs and books are laid out on the tables as in a library computer terminals let viewers study the design process in which mr piano spins his spatial webs this format is designed , presumably , to convey the building workshop s ambiance it also makes clear that for all the elegance of his completed projects , mr piano stresses process elegant in the mathematical as well as visual sense , the work s simplicity is gained at the cost of constant experimentation the exhibition is dedicated to the memory of peter rice , a british engineer who collaborated with mr piano on many projects an excellent text by mr buchanon highlights the show s free catalogue this is not a show that rewards passivity it takes some effort to step out of the customary mode of wallgazing and into mr piano s train of thought a good point of entry is the section on the mobile workshop of otranto , italy in this 1979 project , a temporary structure was set up in the center of the ancient town workshops offered information on restoration techniques so that local craftsmen could rehabilitate abandoned buildings this show provides a similar service for new york it s a traveling caravan of ideas that could help inspire the city to patch up its battered hopes renzo piano

hartford , feb 12 the connecticut supreme court , the state s highest appeals panel , has not been a place of flash and dazzle known until the 1960 s by the unfortunate formal title of the supreme court of errors , the sevenmember panel has been seen as a conservative , often technicalminded body that generally shuns sweeping constitutional pronouncements in favor of unanimous , bland consensus gov lowell p weicker jr seems bent on changing all that , and associate justice robert i berdon is leading the charge justice berdon , mr weicker s first nominee to the court , has emerged in the last 18 months as one of the most outspoken dissenting voices in its history , legal experts say , skewering the majority often in disparaging terms time and again of 147 cases justice berdon heard through last month , he issued his own separate dissenting opinion 39 times , an unprecedented number on this court a couple members of the majority have n't liked my choice of words , justice berdon said in an interview but i'm going to say exactly what i think and what i feel should be said a weicker court \? that sentiment has also formed the basis of much of mr weicker s political career , first in the united states senate as a maverick liberal republican in the 1970 s and 1980 s , and since 1991 as connecticut s first thirdparty governor since the civil war but lawyers and law professors who track the judicial system say that for all the noise , it is too early to tell whether a weicker supreme court is emerging , or simply a court of supreme squabbles mr weicker s two other nominees flemming l norcott jr , 49 , and joette katz were seated last year , too recently to have made their mark if his latest candidate , richard n palmer , 42 , the state s chief attorney , is approved by the general assembly , the majority of the court will be weicker nominees intelligence in common mr palmer has never been a judge justice katz was 39 when she joined the court last year and had been a judge for only three and a half years justice berdon and justice norcott were both senior judges the one thing all four have in common is that they are very , very smart , said hugh c macgill , dean of the university of connecticut law school the stakes for the next court are enormous , as mr weicker s allies and opponents in the legislature acknowledge mr weicker s nominees , for example , will probably be the majority when the landmark school desegregation case now under way in superior court in west hartford proceeds on appeal to the supreme court , as both sides expect it to that case , which hinges on an interpretation of the rights guaranteed by the state constitution , could result in courtordered school desegregation in towns across the state mr weicker has expressed support for a sweeping desegregation plan , although none of the justices have indicated their feelings a dissonant tone some lawmakers who questioned mr palmer on thursday before the general assembly s judiciary committee , which will vote on the nomination next week , were also troubled by the dissonant and sometimes even impolite tone that lately seems to come from the court building across from the capitol it s been a little more acerbic , said representative dale w radcliffe , a republican from trumbull , the ranking house minority member on the judiciary committee justice berdon , a softspoken man who wears bow ties and so reveres adlai stevenson that he named his only son peter adlai berdon , said he believes that there is an obligation to dissent in many cases a cynical public must be shown that justice is being done , he said , and that issues are receiving a real public debate it s important that if you disagree with the majority , you do n't merely go along to tag along , he said you have an obligation to put in your views and words so the the public can know what the other side is it s a constitutional obligation criticism with relish one might debate , though , whether there is a constitutional requirement to criticize one s colleagues with such obvious relish in one dissent last year , for example , in a case challenging the method used in reapportioning state house and senate seats , justice berdon began with the pronouncement that today the majority trivializes the state constititution , and went on to disparage the majority s simplistic reasoning and its confusion and failure to understand the case that is before us today and giving at best , a cursory review of the facts of the case justice berdon s opinion in turn provoked a separate opinion , signed by four members of the majority who attacked justice berdon for his gratuitous and unjustified ad hominem attack on them it is regrettable that the dissenter s disagreement with our conclusions somehow suggests to him that we have not performed our judicial function with the same sense of seriousness with which he performed his , the majority justices wrote a liberal direction some students of the court say the early suggestions are that justice berdon may be pointing the way toward a stricter defense of civil rights , and that if other weicker nominees follow that trend , connecticut could emerge with one of the more liberal courts in the nation justice berdon , who is 63 , faces mandatory retirement in 1999 , when he turns 70 , but justices katz and norcott , and mr palmer , if he is appointed , could serve for decades there s a broad , amorphous feeling that weicker is influencing the judiciary for years to come , and over all there s a liberal tilt , said senator george jepsen , a democrat from stamford and the cochairman of the judiciary committee but there is also only so much that can be known and guessed , other experts say , about how a judge s views may evolve over time chief executives have been disappointed before we all seem very modern in our youth , said representative richard d tulisano , the judiciary cochairman and a democrat from rocky hill photo associate justice robert i berdon , gov lowell p weicker jr s first nominee to the connecticut supreme court , has emerged as one of the most outspoken dissenting voices in that court s history \( steve miller

learning to dance and other stories by sharon oard warner new rivers press , paper , 795 at first , few of the women and men in sharon oard warner s debut collection seem capable of dancing the book includes characters who are actually handicapped women with polio and cerebral palsy , a profoundly retarded teenage girl and , in the title story , deaf ballet students as well as characters weighed down by the more commonplace burdens of bereavement , abandonment and divorce all in some way lack control of their lives , and ms warner s delicately nuanced tales demonstrate their attempts to gain some measure of freedom or power but the selections in learning to dance are also love stories , illustrating not the joys of physical and emotional communion but their tremendous costs in a simple matter of hunger , for instance , a foster mother faces the pain of her attachment to a baby with aids it is a tribute to ms warner s skill that none of these situations appear melodramatic or mawkish her moving fiction forces us to inhabit realms that are sorrowfully familiar from news reports and contemporary culture one , christina s world , is written from the viewpoint of the woman in andrew wyeth s painting but which we prefer to acknowledge from a distance although her precise images bring us uncomfortably close , these stories are seldom despairing instead , they inspire applause for ms warner s talent and for her characters' struggles to live , to love and even to dance
washington , march 23 following is a transcript of the questionandanswer portion of president clinton s first official news conference , held in the east room of the white house today , as recorded by the new york times q mr president , would you be willing to hold the summit meeting in moscow if it would be best for president yeltsin s political health \? have you spoken to president yeltsin \? and do n't you think that if you did go through moscow it would engage the us too closely in the power struggle in the capital \? a you got me on both sides of the issue before i even started well , let me say , first , i have not talked to president yeltsin but i have sent him two letters one , in response to his statement and the other , of course , a letter of condolence on his mother s death i am going to meet in the morning with the foreign minister kozyrev to get a direct , firsthand appraisal of where we are , after which it might be appropriate for us to have a telephone conversation , but i thought i should have the kozyrev meeting first as of this time , we have not received any indications that the russians , specifically president yeltsin and his government , have any desire to change the site of the meeting or the time so we are working very hard , indeed i'm going to have a long session tonight to try to prepare for the summit at the appropriate date in vancouver i will spend i expect to spend a good deal of time this week consulting with the congressional leaders of both parties and others who might have ideas about what we ought to put in our package , and i intend to go there with an aggressive and quite specific plan for american partnership and , so , that s where we are now q would you go to moscow if it was called for \? a well , let me say this , if if they were to express an interest in that , then it s obviously something that we would have to consider , but that has not been done yet and there were some conversations this morning between the secretary of state and mr kozyrev that has not been done yet if that were to happen , then we would cross that bridge when we come to it yeltsin as leader q mr president , what would the us policy be if the soviet legislature votes to impeach mr yeltsin , as appears increasingly likely \? would you continue to view mr yeltsin as the duly elected leader of russia \? a well , i view him as such now he is the only person who has been elected the others are proceeding under a constitution that goes back to the communist era what i would do under those circumstances , i do n't want to speculate about this is another one of those first of all , let me say , we have to appreciate , i think , the unique character of the events going on in russia it is a russian experience i , myself , have been , i think , in a way , most interested by the television interviews of the people in the street in russia , you know , just talking about it they sound almost like our people might sound talking about some fight we were having here they 've been remarkably levelheaded about it and of different opinions , obviously i think we just have to let this play out i do n't want to speculate about what the position of the united states would be in a hypothetical situation nuclear weapons q mr president , have you received any assurances about the command and control of russian nuclear weapons in this crisis \? a we are monitoring that very closely and we will continue to monitor that very closely at the present time , we have no reason to be concerned that the command and control procedures that are appropriate have been interrupted or face any imminent threat of interruption we feel good about it at this time and we will continue to monitor it closely britt us role in russia q wonder what your view of the american possibilities are how do you see the us role \? can the us play a decisive role , or are we really just ultimately bystanders \? a i think somewhere in between i think in the end the russian people will have to resolve this for themselves , and i hope they 'll be given the opportunity to do that in some appropriate fashion but i'm not sure that , you know , we i have only the same access , in a way , that you do in terms of all the possible developments that are in the air i do not believe that we can be decisive in the sense that we can determine the course of events in russia or , frankly , in the other republics of the former soviet union with which we also have a deep interest but i do believe that we are not bystanders for one thing , i do n't think that this country can do what it needs to do , in any acceptable time frame , in moving to a successful economy , unless we move to act across a whole broad range of areas and over the next few days i should have more to say about that as i work hard on this package wolf pentagon budget cuts q mr president , the former secretary of state , dick cheney , and the chairman of the senate armed services committee , sam nunn , have both suggested that your proposed pentagon budget cuts would perhaps be inappropriate at this time of uncertainty in russia and elsewhere around the world are you taking another look at all of those cuts to perhaps revisit the whole issue \?
zagreb , croatia , nov 22 under heavy security , serbian and croatian scholars , artists and political figures have gathered here to seek reconciliation between their republics , which have been at war since april 1991 in a joint statement issued on monday night , the participants said the threeday meeting was intended to begin a civil dialogue to overcome mistrust , hatred and war between the two largest republics of the former yugoslavia no muslims from bosnia and herzegovina were represented at the meeting , which was sponsored by the erasmus guild , though a muslim from croatia attended in the statement the group offered to include slavic muslims from bosnia in future talks none of the participants were from the croatian government or the serbian government indeed , many are considered dissidents or are members of opposition parties in their capitals the most important thing about this conference is that we are meeting at all , said aleksandar nenadovic , a longtime serbian journalist the 15 serbs and 25 croats said the dialogue they had begun should lead to a ceasefire on all fronts , restoration of human rights for all , the reopening of communication links and the end of propaganda wars between zagreb and belgrade the erasmus guild is a private group of croatian intellectuals financed mainly by the soros foundation of new york , which has contributed to programs in postcommunist eastern europe the guild was established 11 months ago to promote democracy the meeting itself was financed by the national endowment for democracy and the international research exchange , both of washington both serbs and croats received anonymous threats by telephone or mail before attending the meeting the participants discussed relations between serbs and croats on economic , cultural and political levels , but prof drago roksandic of zagreb observed , it is too early and too late to have such talks fighting between serbs and croats has claimed as many as 20 , 000 lives in the last two and half years years , in addition to the 200 , 000 muslims who have been killed in the threesided conflict in bosnia that began in april 1992 we are not representing a country as such , said vesna pusic , a croat and a member of the organizing group we are representing ourselves under our own names mr nenadovic added , as intellectuals we have to believe in the power of the word

with only stefan edberg ranked in the top 10 , it seems sweden is not the superpower in tennis it once was so far , seven swedes have played in the men s draw at the united states open , and as a group they have done surprisingly well all three swedes won their matches on monday , and three of four won yesterday , including henrik holm , who upset sixthseeded michael stich , and thomas enqvist , who defeated no 16 andre agassi four more will play today i mean we have good players now , and i have n't been playing good , said the 23dranked holm , who added he hoped to play against stich and germany when sweden plays them in davis cup later this month it might seem the swedes are on the decline after dominating in the 1980 s none of the six swedish men in the men s qualifying tournament made it past the second round last week there are no swedes in the women s main draw bjorn borg brought swedish tennis to the forefront , and two of his countrymen have taken three united states open titles in the last five years mats wilander in 1988 , who is a wild card this year and faces jaime oncins today , and twotime defending champion edberg , who is ranked and seeded no 3 this year those three each spent time as no 1 , and anders jarryd , henrik sundstrom and joakim nystrom were all in the top 10 in the 80 s what happened to the rest \? now , only edberg is consistently winning tournaments and playing the atp tour on a regular basis 'it s not going to continue , there s got to be a decline , peter lundgren , a 10year pro from sweden , said after he lost in the qualifiers you ca n't have five guys in the top 10 forever it s kind of remarkable we have what we have with such a small country the usta system is pretty good right now with sampras and courier the americans are doing well but they will decline , too americans are doing well , taking the top two spots but there are no other americans in the top 10 , compared with 1989 , when there were six americans at the top many swedes said the swedish tennis federation is partly responsible for the decline borg and wilander did it by themselves , said another swede , peter nyborg , last week the federation helps the juniors , but as soon as you turn pro , you 're on your own this is the first time i 've had a personal coach , and i turned pro in 1988 still , the swedes are not that far behind in 1992 , americans won 13 singles titles swedes won 11 going downhill it might have taken everything out of patrick rafter to beat pete sampras nearly three weeks ago in indianapolis the australian has n't fared well since then first , he had to qualify for the open last week because his ranking , which went up to no 84 after beating sampras , was too low at the cutoff date for automatic entry he then lost in the third and final round of qualifying he got into the main draw , however , as a lucky loser , a person who loses during qualifying but advances when someone else pulls out yesterday , he was n't able to take advantage of it rafter lost to doug flach , 36 , 63 , 63 , 61 frazier over shriver it was pam shriver s 15th united states open it was amy frazier s sixth but from their play on court 18 , the match was even frazier , who has lost in the first round four times in flushing meadows , prevailed against the legend who turned pro 14 years ago , 36 , 63 , 75 shriver , 31 , served for the match at 53 but was troubled by double faults frazier capitalized on shriver s mistakes and won the next four games with her strong baseline game and some great cross court shots frazier , who will turn 21 later this month , has fallen from no 19 at the end of 1992 to her current no 81 and was considering retirement earlier this summer for what she called personal reasons but frazier , who was all set to enter ucla and major in education , said she had decided to stay on the tour
waco , tex , march 6 facing a bank of 31 television cameras at a news conference today , federal agents used the opportunity to plead with david koresh , leader of the branch davidian sect , to release his 100 or so followers , including the dead and wounded if he s listening , we want to give him assurances that he and everyone involved will be treated fairly and humanely , said bob a ricks of the federal bureau of investigation we appeal to mr koresh to let those people go who want to go mr ricks said that mr koresh had complete control over the sect , but that the fbi did not view the people inside the compound as hostages , in part because so many of the members took part in the shootout last sunday four agents with the bureau of alcohol , tobacco and firearms and at least three cult members were killed in the 45minute gun battle so far , two elderly women and 21 children , none of them believed to be mr koresh s , have left the compound the sect has stopped discussing any more releases , the officials said no breakthroughs yet mr ricks said negotiations were dragging on and added that while there was no breakthrough on any issue , mr koresh had begun asking federal negotiators how his personal safety would be protected if he surrendered mr koresh and another cult member , steven schneider , have also begun discussing the removal of an unidentified cult member who was killed in the gun battle mr ricks said he was perplexed by the cult s insistence on discussing the removal of only one corpse , since the authorities believe that a number of members were killed and many wounded we have no idea why only one body is brought up and not the others , mr ricks said we have no information on how those bodies are being handled the authorities have used armored bradley fighting vehicles to deliver medical supplies to the group officials seemed to be backing away from earlier statements that on sunday the cult members fired a 50caliber machine gun that at least one member of the cult , paul g fatta , has acknowledged is inside the compound we 're not able to say that anyone was shooting at us with a 50caliber weapon , said daniel hartnett , associate director of the bureau of alcohol , tobacco and firearms in charge of law enforcement but highcaliber weapons were fired unanswered questions the authorities limited the news conference to 25 minutes even though many basic questions remain unanswered the authorities , for example , have yet to identify the official in charge of the sunday morning raid or who planned the raid that fell apart almost instantly one glaring problem in the raid , military experts say , was the inadequate number of of medical personnel and evacuation vehicles two wounded federal agents were taken away on the hoods of vehicles owned by news reporters if i had done an operation , as head of the delta force , and had no medical evacuation for an hour and 40 minutes , i would probably have been courtmartialed , said colonel charlie beckwith , a retired army officer and former commander of the delta strike force who lives in austin in an hour and a half a man lays out there , he s gonna bleed to death federal officials also said they and mr koresh had discussed officials' concern about the sect s resorting to suicide he indicates there is no intent on his part to order a suicide , nor does he contemplate suicide , mr ricks told reporters on friday federal officials have apparently long been concerned about a mass suicide taking place at the compound , and some officials have privately used that concern as a justification for staging a surprise attack rather than a siege on the compound the united states embassy in australia warned federal officials last year that the branch davidian sect was preparing for a mass suicide and would kill the authorities if they tried to intervene , according to a report in the washington post today incident in philadelphia the situation here has many parallels with one in 1985 in philadelphia , where hundreds of police officers confronted a backtonature cult called move in both philadelphia and waco , the authorities sought to arrest cult members on bench warrants for possession of illegal firearms , and to search locations they knew to be heavily fortified in both cases , the authorities passed up opportunities to arrest cult members on the street or when they went shopping and in both situations , the lawenforcement authorities had trained for weeks and arrived in great force , only to be stunned by the cult members' kamikazelike resistance the move disaster concluded when the police dropped a bomb on the move home in west philadelphia eleven move members , including five children , were killed , and 53 houses were burned to the ground an investigatory commission , appointed by mayor w wilson goode , determined that the mayor had abdicated his responsibilities as a leader here in waco , the standoff continues past its 150th hour , and federal officials say they will wait it out , without setting any deadlines for the group to surrender as evidence of the authorities patience , they have begun building more permanent presence outside the compound , bringing in truck loads of building materials and supplies southwestern bell also began setting up new telephones , complete with a microwave dish and a switching station , for the media photos as the standoff at the compound near waco , tex , continues , federal officials said they will not set deadlines for the group to surrender \(

as the national football league rolls into its second full weekend of preseason games , questions abound about the 1993 season we 've got answers what s the buzzword so far in training camp \? the san francisco 49ers' passing system it relies on quick drops and quick reads by the quarterback and shorter passes that shifty receivers can turn into long gains nearly every nfl team is incorporating more of this style into its offense to combat bigger and faster blitzing defenses bill walsh has had a lasting impact what s the deal on expansion \? in chicago on oct 2628 , nfl owners are scheduled to select two new teams that will begin play in 1995 , giving the league expansion for the first time since 1976 when tampa bay and seattle were added the five finalists are st louis , baltimore , charlotte , nc , memphis and jacksonville , fla charlotte and st louis have long been considered the early frontrunners baltimore , however , is making a strong push at replacing charlotte just what is the problem with jeff george \? he stood proudly on draft day in 1990 after the indianapolis colts had made a huge deal to gain the right to make him the first player selected and talked about how wonderful everything was going to be playing in front of his hometown fans and family the euphoria fizzled quickly by sitting out of camp and demanding to be traded , the biggest loss for george is missing the opportunity to better his game under the tutelage of the colts' head coach , ted marchibroda marchibroda can help make george an allpro quarterback what new rule in 1993 will make the most impact \? the play clock being reduced from 45 seconds to 40 seconds between plays look for plenty of delay of game penalties on offense , especially early it is a major adjustment and could signal more teams following walsh s idea of scripting their first few plays just to get their teams off on a correct and timely foot what s new in television contract negotiations \? the nfl ends its current tv contract after this season and owners want a new bonanza deal to supplement free agency art modell has resigned as chairman of the broadcast committee after working with the group for the last 30 years and after negotiating more than 84 billion in tv revenues the new chairman \? commissioner paul tagliabue as he has with nfl properties , expansion and the labor settlement , tagliabue has taken a front seat he has his critics , but one thing about the commissioner is that he subscribes to the theory that few can handle the big matters better than he can so far , he has been right what s an offense worth watching in 1993 \? the miami dolphins with keith byars in the backfield , keith jackson at tight end and new receivers mark ingram and irving fryar , the dolphins have a potential passing attack second to none in the nfl chemistry is the key quarterback dan marino will create it the primary ingredient with the dolphins , however , appears to be linebacker john offerdahl when he played at least half of a game last year and was not sidelined with stomach ailments , miami was 60 when will the maddest scramble for players occur \? teams reduce their rosters to 47 players on aug 30 and on the next day can expand their active inactive roster to 53 players do teams sign free agents they liked but cut or look elsewhere at the bushel of players cut by their competitors \? to make that decision , the scouting leaguewide in preseason games has been more intense than in recent years the biggest mouthful \? san diego chargers coach bobby ross says linebacker junior seau is the best athlete in the nfl seau is special , but that is overkill two for the money \? dallas cowboys linebacker ken norton and philadelphia eagles linebacker seth joyner are as good as seau and should produce special seasons in 1993 it was an absolute crime that neither made the pro bowl last season , particulary joyner no linebacker made bigger impact plays the best of the new head coaches \? two that will succeed immediately are the denver broncos wade phillips and the washington redskins richie petitbon both are former defensive coordinators , both have special relationships with their players and both will take risks and offer an exciting and winning brand of football has al davis lost it \? critics say that the vertical , deep passing game has passed the way of the dinosaur and that the way davis assembles his teams does not match up with trends and personnel in the nfl do n't bury the raiders just yet particularly if they finally get rocket ismail signed , the raiders will be a solid force in 1993
fans of the sevenheaded mouse king will be thrilled to see their favorite villain in yucky detail as he sallies forth in the film george balanchine s 'the nutcracker' like tchaikovsky s two other ballets , the sleeping beauty and swan lake , the nutcracker incorporates a fable about the forces of light and darkness but in the nutcracker , this struggle is seen , delightfully , from a child s point of view and is symbolized in the nutcracker s battle with the mouse monarch details and closeups would seem inimical to the sweep and grandeur of balanchine s choreography , with its sophisticated use of pattern and structure yet the newly released film , which is based on his 1954 production of the nutcracker , embodies a marriage of art forms that balanchine once envisaged in january 1934 , shortly after emigrating from europe to new york , the choreographer told the british critic arnold haskell that he hoped to wed film to ballet film , he said , could explore pattern and new angles and provide closeups of the face , the arm , a wrist , the pointes , all arranged so that the full significance of the work could be revealed in this penetrating interview , which foretold the course his career would take \( i do not believe in anything in ballet but classicism \) , balanchine spoke of film as a tool for popularizing ballet i am thinking of ballet in a much wider sense of bringing it back to the masses as the ideal form of entertainment george balanchine s 'the nutcracker' is that form of entertainment , lovingly directed by emile ardolino and with balanchine s choreography faithfully staged for the new york city ballet s dancers by peter martins , the artistic director of that company , which balanchine cofounded with lincoln kirstein the film , with its wellrehearsed perfection , is no substitute for a live performance of balanchine s nutcracker , which makes its 19thcentury stagecraft visible and exerts its charms through the immediacy of a threedimensional performance but this film is not merely the nextbest thing it is an alternative version that keeps balanchine s dance values intact you would be hard put to find a more gloriously danced pas de deux on film than the grand image of idealized happiness by darci kistler s sugar plum fairy and damian woetzel s cavalier luckily , what you wo n't find in this movie , as opposed to other film or video versions of the nutcracker , is the pop psychology that insists on a subliminal erotic element in the scenario in those versions , it is not enough for marie , a preadolescent girl at a christmas party , to project her fantasies from a male nutcracker doll onto the prince of her dreams her godfather , drosselmeier , even has designs on the little heroine drosselmeier was up this sort of mischief in the 1986 commercial film of the pacific northwest ballet s version , directed by carroll ballard balanchine would have none of this his ballet , while original in its choreography , refers to what the nutcracker was at its creation in 1892 in russia a tale of domestic warmth in the first act and a danced entertainment in the second the choreographer did not live to make his own film of nutcracker , but in the 1970 s he did collaborate with the pbs dance in america team that translated his other choreography so effectively for television that team included mr ardolino and merrill brockway , who collaborated on this film mr ardolino , who died on nov 20 , remained faithful to balanchine s principles he never cut away from the dancing s most important features , and he knew how to zero in on the details that balanchine , in 1934 , said would reveal the significance of the work there is one weakness in the camera work the fabled speed of the city ballet dancers makes the ensembles \( the snowflakes dance and the waltz of the flowers \) look blurred the city ballet states that the film is not speeded up perhaps it needs to be slowed down nonetheless , there is some firstclass dancing on view from the soloists , notably kyra nichols as dewdrop and wendy whelan as coffee in act ii yes , macaulay culkin is in the film , and he does n't do badly it was balanchine who added the character of drosselmeier s nephew to the ballet , identifying him with the nutcracker , who is transformed by marie s love into a little prince there is an unexpected glint of evil in mr culkin s eye when he helps his uncle unwrap the toys but then drosselmeier is scary , too once transformed into a prince , mr culkin should have exchanged the smirk for a smile his mime scene , if devoid of classical style , is fresh in its naturalness the movie s genuine child stars are jessica lynn cohen , an enchanting marie , and peter reznick , all frisky charm as her brother , fritz for a ballet company short on acting experience , the city ballet offers some scenestealing moments bart robinson cook s drosselmeier is a smart old codger , brilliantly timed to the music an inside joke comes with two alumni , edward bigelow and karin von aroldingen , being cast as hilarious grandparents on stage , the nutcracker divides into the reality of act i and the fantasy of act ii was the film s voiceover , by kevin kline , added because it was feared that viewers would not realize they were watching a splendidly filmed ballet , that they would confuse ballet reality with film realism

to the editor as a yearlong resident of cairo , and a member of its expatriate community , i was outraged by the tone and content of your march 31 article cairo journal , which maintains that the fury of islam has dimmed the sparkle for expatriates on the nile the city you describe is not the city in which i live i have never heard of vials of acid tossed at foreign women as you blithely assert without attributing this experience to any source as a foreign woman , i would like to know exactly who has had such experiences and in what context your perceptions of cairo s foreign community are stilted and inaccurate as an administrator at the american university in cairo and a freelance journalist for cairo s englishlanguage press , i know many foreign residents of cairo , and none of them live in the manner you describe so disapprovingly you seem to confuse the opulent lifestyle of upper class cairenes with the habits of the expatriate community at the very least , you do readers a disservice by implying that all foreigners live more luxuriously than all egyptians while some foreigners may indeed live lavishly in cairo , i also know many wealthy egyptians who spend their leisure time at exclusive clubs and surround themselves with maids , errand boys , drivers , cooks and nannies as you state foreigners do i grew up on the upper east side of new york city , and i have never seen so many mercedesbenzes in one city , almost all driven by egyptians i find your assertion that recent terrorist incidents have made most of the 35 , 000 americans and europeans alter their daily routine improbable i cannot believe that your reporter actually spoke with most of these people of the couple of hundred foreigners with whom i have daily contact , only a few have changed their lifestyle at all you state that the american university in cairo and cairo american college have made concerted efforts to lower their profiles and have increased their security staff i work in the public relations office of the american university and can state that while we have tightened our security , we have not made any attempt to lower our profile overall , your tone is exaggerated and biased the few direct quotations are surrounded by such slanted text that the reader interprets far more fear , anger and desperation in the comments than is actually stated this is not to say that there is no fundamentalist terrorism in cairo there is i am very sensitive to the local political climate , and i take potential threats very seriously , but irresponsible and inflated reports fuel the flames of frustration without conveying accurately the atmosphere in cairo patricia smith cairo , april 8 , 1993 drawing
in recent years , the sundance film festival has earned a reputation as the point of entry for independent film makers in search of a distributor in fact , sundance , which begins on thursday , is more like the industry s triplea league , the last stop before the call comes from hollywood in the poststudio era , the first stop , more likely than not , is film school , where hundreds of wouldbe directors churn out thousands of films every year most show occasional flashes of nearcompetence , but the best make the jump to prestigious foreign festivals or sundance , which will show 23 student films this year among the 48 in its shortfilm category the filmschool output is prodigious students at new york university alone make anywhere from 3 , 000 to 7 , 000 short movies a year the other powerhouse film programs at the university of southern california , the university of california at los angeles , columbia university and the american film institute in los angeles kick in their share as well , not to mention the dozens of smaller graduate programs scattered across the country , most of which require that students direct a short thesis film to earn a master s degree somewhere , in those thousands of miles of celluloid , genuine talent lurks consistent with the dismal arithmetic of genius , 99 percent are mediocre or worse but amid the nohopers , the trudgers and the future accountants lurks the occasional steven spielberg or martin scorsese hollywood knows this and the film schools know that hollywood knows pretty quickly a buzz develops around film makers who are hot that year , said robert rosen , chairman of the department of film and television at the university of california the la film community is like a small town , and the word gets out quickly god knows how they get to hear about it , but they do perhaps it s because the schools make it their business to display their wares to the industry , early and often outreach programs include student film festivals , to which industry players and their minions are invited , and special screenings for important groups like the directors guild of america hollywood loves prizes , so the schools give lots of them at their festivals and , just as the little league has its own world series , the film schools can look forward to the regional and national student academy awards , sponsored by the academy of motion picture arts and sciences and now entering its 19th year does it matter \? if someone makes a great student film and no one picks up on it , it could lead nowhere , said erica spellmansilverman , a vice president of the william morris agency in new york if it s picked up by an agency or a producer , it can lead to a substantial career one thing is certain the films are seen we cover every major student film festival , said jack rapke , an agent with the creative artists agency they are a very important avenue for new talent we look at all the films , and we try to assess whether a particular young talent has made a film that is really well crafted , well thought out , well paced , with good performances and good writing considering that many hollywood films , despite an average cost of more than 20 million , reflect none of these qualities , mr rapke s criteria seem a little stiff for film makers barely out of their teens more often , agents , like major league scouts , are not looking for developed talent but for early warning signs ms spellmansilverman thinks she found them in mark christopher , whose film the dead boys' club she saw at last year s filmschool screenings at columbia university the movie , made for 18 , 000 , follows the adventures of a young midwesterner as he tries to make his way in new york s gay world in the age of aids the film is unusual in its use of humor and fantasy its central character , toby , finds that when he puts on a pair of magic red shoes , he is transported back to the gay disco scene of the 1970 s the movie was very different from most student films , very fanciful in a certain way , said ms spellmansilverman , who introduced herself to mr christopher after the columbia screening and later signed him up for william morris what really attracted me was the way it was shot , the way it goes into the club scenes , versus the way the rest of the movie is shot it was different from the usual comingofage approach that most student films have it dealt with a subject that s very important in a quiet way the dead boys club went on to 30 festivals , 10 of them major , and will be shown at sundance in march it will be released nationally by frameline , a distributor of gay films , as part of a package of five short films mr christopher was doubly lucky to snag a distributor for a student film is almost unheard of likewise , it s as easy for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle as it is for a student director to make the leap from a 30minute thesis film to a feature , even a lowend , smallbudget film it happens just often enough to keep the dream alive , said mark j harris , chairman of film and television production at the university of southern california but more often , agents and producers come down to the screenings , then ask if a student has a script , because they can sell a script

belgrade , yugoslavia , aug 19 the prime minister of yugoslavia has accused the united nations of genocide against the people in continuing to enforce economic sanctions against his country in an interview the prime minister , radoje kontic , angrily condemned what he considers the injustice of continuing the sanctions , which were first imposed in may 1992 and were tightened in april they had been imposed because serbia , one of the two remaining republics in yugoslavia , was deemed an aggressor in bosnia and herzegovina but he said the united nations force there had said not one yugoslav soldier was in bosnia our influence on the bosnian serbs has been exaggerated , mr kontic continued i'm not saying there is none , but our influence is limited accepted a plan , now defunct he argued that the sanctions should have been lifted after yugoslavia accepted the socalled vanceowen plan , the peace proposal for bosnia and herzegovina put forward by the united nations and the european community now , tell me , what should we do now that the vanceowen plan is dead \? the prime minister asked why are such rigorous measures applied against yugoslavia \? sanctions are genocide against the people continuation of the sanctions can create an unpredictable effect on the people and the economy , mr kontic said as a reaction to the situation caused by the sanctions , very extreme and very militant groups are being formed , and also some very nationalistic forces mr kontic s government may have little ability to sway the bosnian serbs it surely has only limited influence in yugoslavia itself today it is the serbian republic , led by president slobodan milosevic , that is regarded as the center of power in belgrade a shriveled federation the interview took place in mr kontic s office in the vast palace of the republic , a once crowded and bustling seat of government in new belgrade , across the sava river from the capital but in a reminder of how yugoslavia has shrunk from six republics totaling 23 million people to two republics with 105 million people , the palace s long corridors are lined with empty offices mr kontic is from montenegro , the other remaining republic the prime minister said that with some sectors of the economy completely destroyed , the gross national product of serbia and montenegro had been halved , from 25 billion in 1991 to a maximum of 13 billion this year all investment has ceased , meaning no development , said mr kontic , who succeeded milan panic in december when the latter challenged mr milosevic and was ousted there is no foreign capital whatsoever incomes fell in 1991 the average monthly salary was 250 in the last few months , the average was not more than 30 of 22 million employed in the state sector , 800 , 000 have been placed on longterm leave on minimal pay , the prime minister said we have reached the level of an underdeveloped country of the third world , he said
naha , japan , april 24 on the first journey a modern japanese ruler has made to the southernmost reaches of his country , emperor akihito came this weekend to view the sites where tens of thousands of civilians died a halfcentury ago in his father s name , and to heal the bitter antagonism that many here still feel for the japanese leaders who led them to carnage the visit was the latest in akihito s travels of condolence though not apology to corners of asia that japan left in ruins and sorrow but in many respects , this trip to okinawa was the toughest , to a corner of his own country that has long felt betrayed , forgotten and deeply ambivalent about the emperor its people died defending and that feeling is never stronger than in april , the month of the rain of steel in 1945 that killed a third of okinawa s population , taking more lives in excess of 200 , 000 civilians and soldiers than the atomic bomb at hiroshima as the emperor quickly discovered , virtually every inlet , cave and cliff in this sundrenched , palmstudded island carries with it some remembrance of tragedy i feel deep sorrow that okinawa was turned into a battlefield and that its people were caught in the land battle , he said i hope that the 200 , 000 lives they sacrificed because of the war will not be in vain and that we can continue efforts for peace some remain silent but the emperor received only a lukewarm welcome , and knew from the moment that he arrived that his hosts had mixed emotions about his visit the strongest evidence came seconds after he stepped off his plane at the naha airport most of the 150 or so invited guests raised their arms in three cheers of banzai ! the traditional greeting to the emperor but a small group of dignitaries stayed silent , their hands at their sides among them was masahide ota , the governor of okinawa and a survivor of the blood and iron scouts for the emperor , a fighting corps of highschool boys most of mr ota s schoolmates were killed in the battle , which lasted three months several years ago he described in an interview how he had stayed hidden in a cave until october 1945 , not realizing that japan had surrendered two months earlier mr ota said in a news conference that he welcomed the emperor s visit , but added , i do n't believe this event will put an end to the postwar chapter of okinawa s history he was clearly responding to conservatives who say that with this visit okinawans should stop seeking apologies and reparations for their suffering pawns in other struggles the fundamental source of complaint here , as mr ota wrote some time ago when he was a professor , is that japan s war planners sacrificed okinawa to free more resources for the defense of the mainland many here believe the decision to stage an unwinnable defense effort would have been quite different if the site was one of japan s four main islands but okinawans are accustomed to being pawns in superpower struggles both china and japan claimed the island as a vassal state until it formally became part of japan in 1879 nonetheless , echoes of chinese culture have survived nearly a century of efforts by japan to assimilate its people , and 27 years of postwar occupation by the united states that ended in 1972 both the war and the occupation explain why no emperor has come here before okinawans blame hirohito and his generals not only for the devastation , but also for the decision to encourage the united states to keep up its occupation for so long as a bulwark against communist influences from china and russia even after reversion , okinawa has remained japan s poorest region , with its lowest percapita income , the highest concentration of american troops , and virtually no political influence in tokyo all this may explain why the imperial palace never let hirohito visit here , though he was scheduled to come just before the illness that led to his death akihito did tour okinawa several times as crown prince , including one trip in which a protester threw a firebomb at him on a fourday visit true to the imperial style of speaking softly and carrying a look of concern and compassion , akihito referred to none of okinawa s grievances as his fourday visit began but they were clearly on the minds of the okinawans who watched his motorcade pull up to the neatly preserved memorial to the members of himeyuri corps , or princess lily girls the corps was made up of several hundred highschool girls who were forced into service as nurses' aides in the dark caves that became makeshift hospitals for thousands of dying japanese soldiers as the american forces advanced , the girls were abandoned , and more than 200 were killed in the crossfire or lept from the cliffs to their deaths , rather than face what they were told was certain rape and torture at the hands of the invaders in fact , thousands of islanders committed or were forced into suicide , with some parents killing their children , before the battle came to an end emperor akihito and empress michiko were led through the exhibits of a museum put together by the survivors , tracing the lives of the girls and graphically depicting life in the dank , bloodsoaked caves the museum s pamphlet describes the island s wartime militaristic education program to mold every individual into a selfless , robotlike subject of the emperor in a carefully stagemanaged event , the emperor and empress spent several minutes talking with the elderly survivors of the caves i am very glad that my sisters will be able to sleep in peace now that the emperor has come , ruri miyara , one of the survivors of the himeyuri corps , said as she stood outside the memorial i feel my deceased friends and teachers are saying to the emperor and michiko 'do n't let this happen anymore' sachiko ishikawa , another survivor , said i do n't feel it was the showa emperor who sacrificed the people it was the military powers who controlled him but this emperor , she said , is a little different from his father showa is hirohito s posthumous name while the emperor traveled from one memorial to another , though , civil rights groups were complaining that the vestiges of heavyhanded state control were not yet banished in the weeks leading up to the emperor s arrival , the police arrested several former leftists on what seemed to be minor violations , apparently in hopes of keeping them in preventive detention photo emperor akihito and his wife , empress michiko , second from right , greeting women at a home for the elderly in naha ,

washington , june 8 the white house plans to break the logjam that has delayed the appointment of ambassadors to several major countries , an administration official said tonight former vice president walter f mondale is to be named ambassador to japan richard c holbrooke , an investment banker who was a state department official in the carter administration , is to get the post in germany , and former representative stephen j solarz of brooklyn is to be named envoy to india all of them have been offered the posts and have accepted , the administration official said the nominations are expected to be made public shortly , perhaps as soon as wednesday other appointments likely in addition , reginald bartholomew , a career foreign service officer who the state department has relied on for its most difficult troubleshooting missions , was reported in line to be named ambassador to italy , and prof richard n gardner of columbia university was said to be in line for spain , but the administration official could not confirm those appointments tonight none of the newly appointed ambassadors could be reached by telephone tonight mr solarz was reported by a friend to be out of the country president clinton has been slow in making his choices to the important posts , and it was reckoned last week that 37 of the 164 american embassies are without ambassadors mr mondale , who was vice president in the carter administration and was routed by ronald reagan for the presidency in 1984 , had been offered the ambassadorship to russia by mr clinton in january but turned it down then , according to a friend , he was asked if he was interested in london and , in saying he was not , he mentioned that he was interested in tokyo that fit in well , the friend said , because japan had told the clinton administration that it desired an american ambassador who was an established political leader this preference reflected what many japanese perceive as the success of the ambassadorship of mike mansfield , who had been the senate majority leader before taking the tokyo post new career in banking mr holbrooke , a retired career foreign service officer , is now managing director of lehman brothers , the new york investment banking concern his business interests have often taken him to germany and other countries in europe while his specialty at the state department had been in east asian affairs , the clinton administration had wanted someone in germany who could deal with complex united stateseuropeanasian relations germany had told the administration that it would like an ambassador with political clout in the white house , and mr holbrooke fits that description india told the clinton administration that it wanted someone who knew india well mr solarz , who was defeated in the democratic primary last year , was chairman of the house foreign affairs subcommittee on asian and pacific affairs mr bartholomew is currently representing the united states in peace negotiations on bosnia and previously had been sent to such trouble spots as lebanon and cyprus mr gardner is a law professor at columbia university and is an expert on issues like the environment , population growth and peacekeeping
when wall street talks about dogs in connection with the ralston purina company , it is as likely to be describing some of the st louis conglomerate s major businesses as it is the pets for which ralston makes food acknowledging its problem , ralston has already spun off 55 percent of its baking subsidiary , and tomorrow the board is scheduled to consider a spinoff of its chex cereal , beechnut baby food and privatelabel crackers operations although ralston s shares jumped 16 percent , to 40 , in the two days last month after the news that the company would consider a spinoff , they have since stalled , closing yesterday at 39375 , down 125 cents analysts say that making the parts more apparent is not likely to make the whole any more appealing they are doing all they can , but i 'd be happier if they were selling more dog food , rather than financial engineering , said john mcmillin , who follows the food industry for prudential securities the operating trends are lackluster ralston s portfolio includes some legendary names in consumer products , including purina pet foods , wonder bread and hostess baked snacks , chex cereals , beechnut baby food and eveready batteries except for eveready , though , none of ralston s famous brands are in businesses with doubledigit growth rates most face cutthroat pricing competition , and in many sectors the company is not the lowcost producer ralston earned just over 266 million in the nine months ended june 30 , down slightly from last year , on sales of nearly 6 billion ralston s main appeal in recent years has come at times when the stock has fallen so low in relation to competitors that the analysts saw little downside the shares reached a 52week high of 52125 on march 3 skepticism about ralston on wall street is fed by annoyance they do a lot of petty things to obfuscate , like reporting soybean oil sales on the same line as eveready batteries , said charles ronson , an investment adviser with balestra capital , a new york money management firm lately , though , investors have been finding out a bit more as ralston sheds pieces of itself earlier this year , they began to see just how bad things were at the continental baking company , which ralston acquired in 1984 , as ralston filed the documents with the securities and exchange commission leading up to last month s spinoff and if the board approves the proposed spinoff of cereal , baby food and snack crackers , their strengths and weaknesses would become much clearer ralston described the continental baking deal , known as a targeted stock offering , as a means of giving the managers of the 2 billion enterprise more incentive to shape it up , and both companies more flexibility in raising capital and setting dividends when the plan was announced in january , ralston s shares jumped 96 percent , to 49625 but closer analysis damped the enthusiasm , especially as subsequent financial reports showed just how much the heavily unionized continental had lagged behind the industry in cutting costs continental s price fell from 12 as trading began on a whenissued basis to 8 on the opening day of trading it closed at 950 , up 375 cents , yesterday although the chex brands and beechnut are considered alsorans in their fields , the new company would also include ralston s privatelabel cereal manufacturing operations analysts note that private label manufacturers in other industries sometimes trade at multiples of 40 times earnings or more ralston holds 80 to 90 percent of the privatelabel cereal market the cereal announcement attracted attention again to how cheap the stock had become , said eric larson , who follows ralston for morgan stanley they 've still got a bunch of things going against them

muses her companion , picking up the little vase of wild blossoms with her wellmanicured fingers and dreamily reciting their names i just love this look she snaps out of her reverie , looks around the airy room and says crisply i wish fred would get here i wanted him to see this restaurant it s exactly the look i'm aiming for in the apartment matthew s is a decorator s dream with its summery rustic feel white linen , rattan chairs , big baskets of fruit and white ceiling fans lazily cutting through the air it looks like a coffee table book come to life the room has been so artfully executed by sig bergamin that you have the impression the place was n't designed at all the women at the next table know better remember what this used to look like \? says the redhead to her friend alo alo , all those silly statues \? they must have spent a fortune redecorating the restaurant certainly knows its clientele when fred rushes in late as usual , he apologizes he orders a vodka and tonic and immediately starts talking about how much the restaurant reminds him of his favorite place on the cape the menu looks laidback , too there is nothing here that leads you to expect the sort of sophistication coming out of the kitchen take tuna tartar it s a pretty plate of food , a small red mound atop a pale green one , with little olive squiggles of tapenade scattered around the edges the silky fish , perfumed with the fresh , citric aroma of kaffir lime leaves , sits on a crunchy heap of chopped fennel squash and wild mushroom risotto is a chef s homage to fall the palette is rust and brown with hints of gray , and the flavors are deep , earthy and rich it is like seeing an autumn forest painted on a plate the redhead has picked at her food , but she stares covetously down at the dish , an angular piece of porcelain that is halfway between a soup bowl and a salad plate i must get some of these , she says the chef , matthew kenney , knows his trends the pick hits of the season are all on the menu but this is not copycat cuisine , for each dish has been carefully reconstructed with a personal twist usually this works linguine with chanterelles , a fabulous tangle of white beans , bacon , herbs and mushrooms , offers a different flavor with each bite endive and pears with roquefort and grilled walnut bread make an ingenious seasonal salad mr kenney has reinvented his food along with the room he cooked italian when it was alo alo , brazilian when he was at banana cafe now he s doing his american stint sometimes he gets carried away he s thrown arugula into his caesar salad , which adds an interesting note he should have stopped there with the cheese that is already in the dressing , his addition of more on top overwhelms the greens his crab cakes are overly fussy they have too much cumin , too much lemon , too much ginger , too much pimento and too little crab and then there s the dish called wood grilled squab with foie gras , muscat grapes , roasted pear and aged balsamic what you get are fighting flavors on the plate although the appetizers sometimes get away from him , mr kenney is in control of the entrees venison with juniper and dates sounds sort of silly , but the lean , gamy flavor of the venison comes through what looks like a potato crisp turns out to be parsnips and salsify , an added flavor kick fragrant lamb is served over ratatouille with little filo pastries on the side cardamom and ginger sound like a tough duo for a fish to take on , but when the fish is roasted salmon , it has the flavor to hold its own what do you think these crumbs are \? wonders the redhead she pokes at the golden crust that surrounds the moist white fish the answer , i think , is particularly crisp japanese panko i like the touch i also like the braised artichoke hearts , which add a depth of flavor that the cod can use and the charcoal grilled lobster is delicious , two little tails curled up on a bed of green risotto fred , having finished his second vodka not a bad option , given the weakness of the wine list is trying to persuade his companions to eat dessert no wonder desserts here are terrific i like the rustic apple tart , which comes with a beautiful green apple sorbet , and i'm partial to the caramelized pineapple with rice pudding and coconut ice cream but it s the flan that i find myself talking about when people ask about the restaurant it sounds like an awful idea port wine flan with pears and roquefort crisps but the sweet wine is perfect as a creamy custard and roquefort makes an astonishingly delicious flaky pastry , especially when topped with finely diced pears put them together , and you have a creative interpretation of cheese and fruit and wine and a perfect way to end a meal fred likes it too did you taste it \? he asks his companions is n't it amazing \? yes , replies the redhead and it s so pretty in short fresco fresco is just two weeks old , but already every table is taken at lunch perhaps it s because the place smells so delicious that every time the door opens wonderful aromas go wafting down east 52d street or has word gotten out that the tuscan food is served with an unusually generous hand \? whatever the reason , patrons in this fledgling restaurant look extremely content after one bite of grilled pizza , a deliciously charred oval of dough slathered with tomatoes and cheese , it is easy to see why a big bowl of manila clams comes with a thick slice of buttered toast to dip into the sauce of white wine , ginger , garlic and hot peppers pappardelle , sheer sheets of pasta , are served in a ragout of extraordinary richness braised lamb arrives on a bed of creamy polenta chef vincent scotto worked at al forno in providence , the waiter confides i really love his food clearly , he is not alone fresco is at 34 east 52d street in manhattan \( 212 \) 9353434 matthew s  matthew s , 1030 third avenue , at 61st street , manhattan , \( 212 \) 8384343 atmosphere summer in the city the upper east side in a relaxed mood tables are a bit too close for comfort service for the most part kindly and casual , although at times it is so casual it becomes forgetful recommended dishes tuna tartar , linguine with chanterelles , endive and pear salad , risotto , saddle of venison , charcoal grilled lobster , roasted cod , port flan , rustic apple tart wine list not on a par with the quality of the food it is especially difficult to find reasonably priced red wines credit cards all major cards price range lunch appetizers 6 to 9 , main courses 13 to 16 dinner appetizers 7 to 12 , main courses 17 to 22 hours lunch from noon to 4 pm , light meals 4 to 6 pm and dinner 6 pm to midnight , all daily wheelchair accessibility excellent what the stars mean \( none \) poor to satisfactory good very good excellent extraordinary ratings reflect the reviewer s reaction primarily to food , with ambiance and service taken into consideration menu listings and prices are subject to change
should polluters be allowed to buy their way out of cleaning up \? the idea of selling pollution indulgences does not go down easily among those steeped in the puritan ethic once understood , though , the concept of converting environmental sin into a commodity that can be traded like heating oil futures or ibm stock looks like the cheapest way to solve some expensive problems but a first major test , a national auction of rights to emit sulfur from power plant smokestacks , was received with something less than enthusiasm last month and by no coincidence , the state regulators who can make or break the trading system are viewing its birth with deep suspicion champions of marketable emissions allowances are now worried that their baby will be smothered in the crib since pollution is bad for children , trees and other living things , it would be nice and might be crucial to have less of it but how to get from here to there \? the traditional approach is commandandcontrol tell polluters what standard they must meet , and perhaps even dictate the technology brute force works america s air and water are far cleaner than they were two decades ago but brute force is expensive well in excess of 100 billion a year , by the environmental protection agency s reckoning , and rising far more rapidly than the gnp that is why an unlikely coalition of environmentalists and conservatives fought for a more flexible system for halving the sulfur emissions dumped on forests and lakes downwind power plants can cut emissions by encouraging energy conservation , by switching to lowsulfur fuels or by snatching sulfur particles from exhaust gases with chemical scrubbers but the cost varies greatly according to the location and age of the plants so the logical approach is to let the utilities choose their own strategies and the logical extension of the logical approach is to let utilities pool their efforts by creating free markets in emission rights under the clean air act of 1990 , utilities may meet the sulfur standard on their own , or buy allowances to emit sulfur by the ton from utilities that exceed the standard polluters are even allowed to squirrel away unused allowances for future use or sale a halfdozen trades have already been privately consummated between consenting utilities however , the first public auction came only on march 30 , when the chicago board of trade offered a big block of allowances controlled by the environmental protection agency the auction was not a failure washington sold out its inventory but it was hardly a smashing success prices were a small fraction of the estimated cost of meeting the standard with scrubbers , evidence that utilities are not focusing on leastcost approaches to meeting the standard moreover , virtually none of the allowances offered privately were sold , suggesting that everyone is wary of playing the new game lester lave , an economist at carnegie mellon university , partly blames the arcane auction rules thoughtlessly dictated by congress but mr lave and just about everyone else rooting for the system agree that state regulators are also undermining its chances utility commissions in midwestern states that produce highsulfur coal are pressuring local utilities to install expensive scrubbers , presumably to keep miners employed and mines profitable as disturbing , most commissions have failed to spell out who bears the risk in utility compliance strategies if a company buys allowances now for 500 a ton , will its stockholders be forced to eat part of the cost if prices later fall to 300 \? by the same token , if a utility decides to scrub , will it be penalized if it cannot sell the allowances generated for a high enough price to have justified the decision \? nobody knows , laments mr lave , and thus no utility is sticking its neck out a more direct challenge to sulfur emissions trading is coming from thomas c jorling , new york s state s environment commissioner mr jorling fears utilities in the ohio valley will pay up rather than clean up , leaving the adirondacks to cope with more sulfuric rain he wants to inhibit interregional trading and , in particular , to stop the sale of allowances to plants upwind of new york the environmental defense fund challenges his premise there simply are not enough allowances out there to make it practical for midwestern utilities to avoid a major cleanup , argues joseph goffman , a lawyer for the fund and he thinks that the jorling ploy could boomerang , inhibiting these same utilities from pursuing aggressive cleanup strategies in the 1990 s to ease their burden in the next century but the deeper objection to mr jorling s crusade is that he is trying to wriggle out of a hardwon deal that balanced the interests of region against region and environmentalism against economic growth the midwest is taking it in the neck to save the adirondacks , mr goffman said it is a wretched precedent , he suggests , to stop the region s utilities from using the law to minimize the cost drawing
purchase , ny , june 3 the knicks departed for chicago today , perhaps headed for the end of their season to avoid elimination friday night in game 6 of the eastern conference finals , new york must somehow regroup quickly from its most devastating loss of the playoffs with wednesday night s dramatic 9794 victory , the chicago bulls moved a step closer toward winning a third consecutive national basketball association championship meanwhile , the knicks remained a team in shock today , shaken by losing such a crucial game during the final frustrating seconds perhaps the only good news for the knicks concerned the condition of charles oakley s right hand the starting power forward has a bruised right ring finger , but xrays taken this morning were negative , meaning oakley will play in game 6 but trailing three games to two in the fourofsevengame series , the knicks remained in deep trouble as the players dejectedly boarded the team bus today , pat riley made a speech of determination , not desperation 'a wild ride' we are not going to let go of the goal that we have set for ourselves , said the knicks' coach this is going to be a wild ride if you do n't want to come along for the ride , stay home we 're going in there to play the best game that we 've ever played , and we have to that s what it s going to take it takes about a day to sort of get over it it takes about a day to stop feeling sorry for yourself , like you 're a victim once you get rid of the feeling , the highest form of sanity is the present moment the present moment is that we 're heading out to chicago , and we still have that goal in sight but as riley spoke , the knicks boarded the bus in somber silence many players , such as charles smith , anthony mason , patrick ewing and doc rivers , walked past reporters without comment looking at their faces , it was impossible to tell that 12 hours had passed since game 5 ended they looked as grim as they did in the locker room immediately after the game chance to recover riley , one of coaching s master psychologists , faced a major challenge in the hours leading up to game 6 the team did not practice today , as riley gave the players a chance to recover emotionally and physically attitude will be just as important as strategy because , after five games , there are no secrets between these two teams before the knicks can move forward , riley must help put the hurt of game 5 behind them their horrendous freethrow shooting \( 20 for 35 \) in game 5 will haunt the knicks should they lose this series they were also badly outrebounded \( 4837 \) , a department that new york prides itself in , particularly at home could 've , would 've , should 've is n't part of winning championships , riley said the worst thing to do is wallow in what you did n't do , after the result but everywhere the knicks turned television , radio , newspapers , telephone there were reminders of game 5 how many times during the night had smith relived the final seconds , when he failed to convert four layup chances from pointblank range that could have given the knicks a lastsecond victory \? fateful possession new york s final possession began with chicago leading , 9594 , with 288 seconds left patrick ewing fell to the ground as he drove to the basket , but he made a pass while falling with about 12 seconds left to smith , who was three feet from the basket in the lane smith s first attempt was blocked by horace grant with about 10 seconds to play smith rebounded , but then he had the ball stripped by michael jordan as smith went up smith recovered again , but his next shot hit the underside of the backboard as scottie pippen partly deflected it smith s final layup attempt was blocked by pippen from behind grant grabbed the rebound , then passed to jordan , who spotted b j armstrong behind new york s defense armstrong made a layup at the buzzer , and the bulls left the court celebrating , as stonefaced knicks' fans saw the team s 27game home winning streak end thursday morning secondguessers have questioned not only whether smith was fouled , but have suggested that he should have tried to dunk , particularly on his final attempt smith has been troubled all season by missed layups and lost balls under the basket , bringing the ball down below his waist where defenders can slap it away no problem for riley yet after suffering through the videotape this morning , riley had no problem with the nofoul call , nor did he believe smith should have taken the ball up stronger charles made a great effort four plays on the rim , riley said we had more than enough opportunities prior to that not to be in that situation i have no complaints about that last play this was a classic case of a championship team doing what it took to win against a challenger that buckled under pressure jordan did not have a torrid shooting night \( 11 for 24 \) , but his tripledouble was another example of his extraordinary versatility he made pinpoint passes , including the assist on armstrong s 3point jumper from the deepleft corner that put chicago ahead for good , 9593 , with 1 minute 16 seconds left jordan also grabbed crucial rebounds and during an 11minute44second stretch of the third and fourth quarters , jordan scored all 17 of the bulls' points meanwhile , jordan s defense helped harass john starks \( 8 points , 3for11 shooting \) into his poorest performance of the series as for pippen , he may have played even better than jordan past criticism of pippen for being a soft player , for being one who did not rise to the occasion , seemed unjustifed in light of his performance in this series he scored 28 points and got 11 rebounds wednesday through game 5 , pippen has averaged 222 points and 68 rebounds stalking history if the bulls win the series , they will be the first nba team since the 1977 portland trail blazers to recover from a twogamestonone deficit to win a fourofsevengame series the knicks won a playoff game at chicago last season , and they won a regularseason game there this season , although jordan missed that game serving a onegame suspension so despite the looks on their faces , the knicks knew their task was not impossible the pressure definitely reverts to them , riley said of the bulls the whole world is expecting them to finish us off they are expecting to finish us off we go in there tomorrow with a different state of mind we can win on the road rebounds charles oakley said he would treat his jammed right ring finger with ice and hope it improved before game 6 i just could n't hold the ball , oakley said when asked if his finger affected him in game 5 patrick ewing changed into practice gear before the knicks left and shot for a few minutes what did ewing do \? he shot free throws , of course
when laurence o'connnell was told one day last february that the white house was calling , he thought it was a practical joke if dr o'connell had been a medical economist , he might not have been surprised but instead he is a medical ethicist , president of the park ridge center , a chicago institute that studies the intersection of health care and religious beliefs and the call , he says now , came out of the blue that was also the case for most of the 30 other people working in the field of medical ethics who were invited to join the 500 or so experts that president clinton and his wife , hillary , put to work this year forging a plan to overhaul the nation s health care system highlighting ethical issues and submitting them to careful moral analysis are activities that mix uncomfortably with the rhetoric and roughhouse of politics medical ethicists drawn into the world of lawmakers often complain that their work becomes fodder or window dressing for political agendas now , as health care finally takes center stage in american politics , a lot of the ethicists who tore up their normal lives and moved or commuted to washington for two months of mindwearying discussions are asking what they accomplished conversations with about a third of them draw out stories of deplorable working conditions , heated debates , intellectual frustration and even financial loss \( they covered their own travel and living expenses \) but almost all say they would do it again as one of the last working groups to be appointed , the ethicists found themselves without a permanent meeting room of their own , and their sessions became a kind of floating crap game in the old executive office building there was a particularly lovely stairwell we found very comfortable , said nancy neveloff dubler , a lawyer and professor at the albert einstein college of medicine in the bronx who directs the division of bioethics at montefiore medical center she was not exaggerating the group was assigned neither telephones nor computers she who had a laptop got to write the draft or make the revisions , said carol levine , only a bit whimsically ms levine heads the orphan project at the fund for the city of new york , a research project on the effects of aids on surviving children the working group s only explicit mandate was to write a preamble for eventual legislation that would spell out the values motivating the proposed changes in the health care system , linking them to the nation s moral and religious traditions the ethicists were divided about the wisdom of the mandate , and eventually about its execution as director of the center for biomedical ethics at the university of minnesota , arthur caplan drew a lesson from that state s success in passing a significant health care measure , as well as from the experience of britain and canada the lesson was that only a strong , clear consensus on guiding principles , like universality of coverage , would keep the effort on track first , argue values , then debate the mechanics , dr caplan said the president took this approach in his sept 22 speech before congress , and some members of the ethics working group saw their efforts reflected in his language the ethicists put tremendous energy into writing the preamble there were sharp disagreements , too , not so much about its substance as about whether it should be an easily accessible , inspiring statement or a carefully argued set of principles some wanted it to sing opera , and some wanted atonal music , said ronald bayer , who teaches public health at columbia university he was among those who doubted whether preamblewriting was the best use of the ethicists' skills i ca n't believe they needed us to write the speeches , he said a preamble , or values framework , dr o'connell said in response , would become the standard by which any new system could be evaluated and held accountable the ethicists soon took up other tasks as well , often at the request of other working groups some analyzed privacy problems linked to the proposed issuing of a national health security card some worked on ethical issues related to malpractice claims or to organ transplants the group produced more than two dozen position papers on such topics most frustrating was the administration s clear signal that it did not want the ethicists discussing guidelines for medical rationing most of them doubt the administration s conviction that removing inefficiencies will make limits on services unnecessary they want the grounds for those limits openly examined none of the ethicists sound totally confident about their impact in washington professor bayer calls it very modest yet most of them describe the experience , for all its travails , as one of the most intense and exciting of their professional lives many also express admiration for the moral passion and ethical sensitivity that they encountered throughout the administration s choice of health care experts paradoxically , that fact could support the argument that medical ethics made its real contribution to health care changes not by joining the clinton effort in 1993 , but by more than a decade of drawing attention to the inequities and irrationalities in the health care system

this may well be remembered as the year two bidders seemed out of control , raising the price of a 19thcentury calculator , valued at 30 , 000 , to 118 million edgar mannheimer , the swiss dealer who bought the mechanism by telephone in may at christie s in london , later reneged on his purchase , claiming he was ill and on medication during the auction thus , the only spectacular price achieved in an auction of artifacts this year was never paid the sale was indicative of the continued problems in the market for period objects prices are down , sales are off , and the records at auction are far fewer in number and less impressive than in many years of course , economic uncertainties worldwide are blamed for the decline in buying and selling since the 1980 s but another factor has set in boredom in buying is increasingly evident among all but the most dedicated collectors only a few objects have broken records in their categories this year they were sold mostly to buyers who , as usual , remained anonymous with fewer contenders for masterpieces , owners are not selling unless forced to and buyers are able to acquire great works for less than record prices although the price hurdles rose in scores of categories in the 1980 s , some of those have been surmounted since january the costliest item sold at auction this year was a regency desk in the greek style , a hefty design decorated with bronze owls and lions' heads , which brought 26 million last month at christie s in london dealers and museum curators were either impressed or appalled by the auction house s excessive description of the sevenfootlong desk likening it to an icon of the greek revival , the catalogue praised the piece as royal in quality and association and yet christie s hedged on the desk s pedigree , saying only that it was almost certainly commissioned about 1812 by henry william paget , the first marquess of anglesey , for his house in burlington gardens charles cator , the head of english furniture sales at christie s , said the price was three times what the auctioneer expected there was even less proof of an aristocratic pedigree for the blueandwhite 15thcentury iznik candlestick auctioned at sotheby s in london in april for 975 , 650 the price was more than double the presale estimate and established a record for islamic art while the sale rated only a few paragraphs on the back pages of several british newspapers , the unstated reason for the auction the unraveling of a turkish cypriot tycoon s financial empire in britain was making frontpage headlines birol nadir , who owned the candlestick , is the son of asil nadir , the 52yearold former head of polly peck international , a british conglomerate that collapsed in 1990 with debts of about 2 billion when birol nadir reportedly defaulted on a loan , the candlestick was sent to sotheby s in january by the trustee savings bank of london at the time of the auction , his father was awaiting trial on 13 counts of fraud and false accounting that involved about 47 million denying all wrongdoing and jumping bail of 52 million asil nadir fled to turkishcontrolled northern cyprus in may the candlestick , covered with blue and white flowers and undecipherable calligraphy , is unusually large and chunky it is nine inches tall , nine inches in diameter and a rarity the earliest piece of such pottery in private hands the other 10 or so examples are in european museums the candlestick is chinese in style but not in detail , said john carswell , the head of islamic art sales at sotheby s in london its form was influenced by early ottoman metalwork while the blueandwhite decoration was probably inspired by ming porcelain , the leaves and flowers are turkish the inscriptions , which are more decorative than legible , are in arabic and kufic script another recordbreaker this year a minor one , for a german tin toy was the 1904 ferris wheel by marklin of germany , auctioned in february at sotheby s in london for 88 , 000 while marklin produced other toy ferris wheels , none is as decorative as this one hand painted with silveredmetal spirals and coloredglass points on its starshaped wheel , it boasts many details absent from other turnofthecentury versions even more important to paul chambers , the pittsburgh contractor and toy dealer who bought the item , was its good condition the paint on a few flags is chipped and only two of the original 12 plaster figures are still in the boatshaped gondolas , but the music does play when the 20inchtall ferris wheel is cranked by hand according to jon baddeley , the head of sotheby s collectibles sales in london , the russian carousel , as its maker called it , attracted fierce bidding because no one had ever seen another like it although a 20thcentury toy fared better than a 19thcentury calculator , it may take a 21stcentury calculator to improve the numbers in this lackluster market photos in april , an iznik pottery candlestick from the 15th century sold at auction for 975 , 650 more than double the presale estimate and established a record for islamic art \( sotheby s \) a 20inchtall ferris wheel , above , made

in a week when the new york book crowd was hopping between parties for dominick dunne s trashy novel a season in purgatory and dr ruth s coffeetable catalogue , the art of arousal , a murderer s row of poets came together for an evening in hell gathered at the 92d street y to read from their joint translation of dante s inferno was a dream team conjured in the glow of a bottle of sangiovese uncorked three years ago in a detroit restaurant by the poets daniel halpern and james merrill sangiovese is a tuscan red dante was a tuscan too it s possible to imagine his shade hovering that night in detroit the inferno , after all , is about one poet \( virgil \) guiding another \( dante \) as james merrill writes in his introduction to the book on which the readings at the y were based \( dante s inferno , just published by mr halpern s ecco press \) unlike any other epic poet i can think of , dante has no hero to celebrate it is his selfconfessed frailty , his need for guidance , that draw us to him what drew such disparate poets as amy clampitt , w s merwin , sharon olds , galway kinnell , mark strand , c k williams and alfred corn into the translating project \? the glory of the poem itself , the grand enterprise of making a work written 700 years ago beautiful for a new generation the standard translations available today are decades old and in prose the poets wanted a chance after the extraordinary seamus heaney signed on , the hook was baited and the others bit mr halpern said that few poets had turned him down , and then only because they felt inadequate to the task even for those who signed on , the worst obstacle was a fear of failure none of the poets are native speakers of italian , though jorie graham grew up in rome , and came close others were more or less fluent cynthia macdonald had the italian of an opera singer , which she used to be charles wright spent a youthful year in italy on a fulbright everyone used dictionaries mr halpern did a lot of handholding but there was a real sense of joy throughout and , on the night of the performance , excitement and anxiety there were a few anxieties in the audience , too , epic poetry being a tough sell lately heading for his seat in the auditorium , jonathan galassi , the editor in chief of farrar , straus giroux , dared express what was on the minds of most of us this could be a very long evening , he said , eyes rolling and he s a translator of the poet eugenio montale , surely a step ahead of the rest of us the readings , only slightly abridged , were supposed to last two and a half hours fat chance it took closer to four for some , there was to be a postpoetry spread laid on by edwin cohen \( a businessman and patron of literature \) back at his apartment in the dakota , a dantesque menu announced in advance roast suckling pig stuffed with fruit , nuts and cheese tuscan salami prosciutto on polenta triangles , white beans with fennel so the occasional growl of a stomach punctuated the reading , and there were moments , if you had n't snacked first , when you abandoned all hope of getting fed and to bed before dawn but no one was complaining , and every seat was full , and mirabile dictu stayed full , even after the intermission no wonder it was a chance to hear many of the best poets writing in english each had translated a canto or two nineteen showed up some thought the missing poet was phil rizzuto , that newly discovered bard of italian descent whose oeuvre , translated from his broadcasts of yankee games , has also just been published by ecco press under the title o holy cow ! though disappointed not to see mr rizzuto there , watchers of italianamerican celebrities made do with robert de niro in the audience the noshow was carolyn forche , who declined to make the trip from baltimore \( if someone had tossed a grenade at the stage , she would have been the last living american poet \) the readers first sat for a team photo , then sat on stage , stepping forward to recite one of the cantos they had translated seamus heaney batted leadoff from almost the first lines of the first canto , you knew it was going to be a 90 s kind of epic mr heaney translated dante s state of mind at midlife as panic , that quintessentially late20thcentury condition of course the inferno s for every age , but aside from the great beauty of language and the emotional appeal of the journey of selfdiscovery , what s in it for our time , and what stood out in the reading , is its sheer seamy violence , vulgarity and exuberant sense of evil especially satisfying are the torments meted out to enemies of the poet , who settles scores with glee some of us heard dante in the audience , laughing last , knowing that those florentine cruds who crossed him in 1300 still get their comeuppance every time his poem is read take the handling of bodily parts and bodily functions in canto 28 , delivered by robert pinsky \( in true poet s garb , black as satan s heart \) his rendition is far too colloquial to quote here suffice it to say canto 28 revels in cruel and unusual punishments men split from chin to anus , entrails spilled , decapitations and disembowelings for what \?

in their letter of june 13 both drs lisa whitten and wanda j whittenshurney attempt to make a legitimate case for preferential treatment toward blacks it is worth noting that during the mid60 s , when the civil rights bill was being debated , the venerable and late senator hubert h humphrey explained the intent of the bill was to create color blindness on the part of both lawmakers and policymakers yet , affirmative action , reverse discrimination and quota systems appear to be inconsistent with senator humphrey s understanding of civil rights moreover , what might be the effect if other major groups of people tried to cash in on affirmative action , if indeed they could prove discrimination against members of their groups \? for example , on jan 19 , 1973 , the united states department of labor published guidelines on discrimination in the federal register it stated in part \( b \) 60501 that jews and catholics , italians , greeks , and slavic groups are victims of bias in employment because of their background yet , none of these groups receive affirmative action consideration for targeted goals in hiring or promotion even now , the rutherford institute , a conservative group in northern virginia , reveals that for the past two years , an affirmativeaction program is operating in the united states forestry service to benefit homosexuals and bisexuals one ca n't help but wonder what senator humphrey , if he was alive today , might think of life styles being included under civil rights \? thomas e dennelly baldwin

fort myers , fla , march 17 there were no hints of wade boggs in the boston red sox clubhouse today , no signs he had played 11 years for them no one was wearing no 26 on his uniform in mourning no one had boggs s baseball card taped to his locker and no one , repeat no one , mentioned missing him the player who has often told a bizarre tale of willing himself invisible when threatened with a knife outside a bar in gainesville , fla , four years ago seemed invisible again as the yankees opposed the red sox for the first time since signing the freeagent third baseman to a threeyear , 11 million contract actually , boggs was absent today because manager buck showalter helped him avoid a potentially hectic scene by excusing him from the game at city of the palms park boggs , instead , played tonight in port charlotte against the texas rangers , where he went 0 for 3 as the yankees were handcuffed by nolan ryan and four relievers , 10 with or without boggs on hand , the red sox are acting as if their finest hitter over the last decade no longer exists good riddance some red sox officials refuse to refer to boggs by name they call him the guy we had last year when asked about an informal newspaper poll that revealed most boston players were glad boggs was gone , manager butch hobson and general manager lou gorman did not disagree but they declined to discuss it i never saw him as a headache , said hobson , who is in his second year as manager i have a great deal of respect for wade boggs and i always will he knows how i feel about him at least , i think he knows how i feel the tone for how the red sox would react to life without boggs was set when roger clemens , who has lionized former teammates dwight evans and jim rice after their final years with boston , grouped boggs with phil plantier and jody reed he said none would be missed it s all for the best there were a few guys who did n't want to be here and they were miserable playing here , clemens said recently so it was best for them to move on scott cooper is the 25yearold third baseman who has replaced the 34yearold boggs and who will field as many boggs questions as grounders this year cooper said he would not hit 338 for 10 years , as boggs averaged for the last 11 hobson predicted that cooper would hit 280 will that be enough to keep boggs invisible \? my dad told me that i'm not trying to replace anyone , cooper said nobody replaced reggie jackson guys came after him and succeeded because they played their game it s not going to be what wade boggs did it s going to be what scott cooper can do although cooper said he did not chat with boggs much while batting 276 last year , he observed him i learned how to block everything else out by watching him , cooper said the pressure , the fans , the media somehow he could block it all out it s amazing how he could do it it was a renowned boggs trait and that is why gorman has difficulty believing that boggs batted 85 points below his career average last season because he was distracted by his contract situation opendoor policy the red sox offered him a twoyear , 92 million contract before the 1992 season , a pact that could have escalated to 14 million with an option year but boggs did not sign and the two sides did not negotiate during the season generally speaking , it s hard to believe it bothered him , gorman said but i ca n't speak for him it may have bothered him , i do n't know if it did , why did n't he come into my office \? my door was always open boggs never knocked now , batting 304 in his first camp with the yankees , boggs says he does not miss boston and the feelings his former teammates have toward him may be mutual after being quite accessible during spring training , boggs politely ended an interview on monday after two questions about the red sox he had nothing more to say inside pitch sam militello \( 30 , 300 era \) solidified his grasp on a rotation spot by pitching four sound innings to pace the yankees to a 32 victory over the red sox in a rainshortened five inning game in the night game shutout loss to texas , nolan ryan of the rangers allowed only a single to pat kelly over five innings , walking none and striking out four mike witt did not work out because his groin injury is still troubling him and manager buck showalter said it was doubtful that witt would be the fifth starter to begin the season photo with or without wade boggs , the red sox are acting as if their finest hitter in the last decade no longer exists the feelings his exteammates have toward him may be mutual boggs says he does n't miss boston \( barton silverman the new york times \)
to the editor what katie roiphe is reporting in the morning after is none other than the historic struggle by women to define rape on their own terms as a legal and moral concept , rape has suffered from a key problem the word has traditionally meant theft or taking , as in the rape of the lock this definition derives from the idea that women are property , or chattel it is , quite simply , a man s definition women \( and enlightened men \) know that rape is not mere theft , a crime against property , but is a crime against the person a very serious crime it has taken generations for this idea to take hold in the legal system , as witnessed by the prosecutor linda a fairstein , whose book , sexual violence , was also reviewed by wendy kaminer what is happening on college campuses is not feminist terrorism , as ms roiphe fears , but the struggle for preeminence between the women s and men s definitions and the stakes are high , because the one who can define the terms of the game has a distinct advantage cynthia frazier santa monica , calif
washington , may 4 the national institutes of health this week will officially shut the offices and seize the files of two of the nation s most prominent investigators of scientific fraud , saying they went beyond the purview of one of its institutes the pair , dr walter stewart and dr ned feder , will be assigned to other jobs at the national institute of diabetes and digestive and kidney diseases , where they had carved out unusual roles as selfstyled investigators of fraud in the last decade late today representative john d dingell of michigan , who has supported their efforts , sent a letter to donna e shalala , secretary of health and human services , expressing concern about the action and asking whether the reassignment represents a retreat on the part of the agency from its commitment to integrity in research mr dingell , the democratic chairman of the house energy and commerce committee , asked why the action had been taken and what plans the department of health and human services , which oversees the health institutes , had made to insure that investigations of misconduct continued files to be retained members of the congressman s staff said officials of the institutes had agreed to retain dr stewart s and dr feder s files on scores of cases of scientific misconduct they said the officials had also agreed to keep the computers and programs that the two investigators had used to detect plagiarism this is very sad , said dr stewart they are going to seal everything up in a tutankhamen s tomb here , all our files , and neither we nor the administrators will have access to them without a subpoena the policemen will arrive here on monday morning to make sure all the files are in the tomb before they change the locks permanently the case that prompted the action was a comparison of texts , using the plagiarism machine , that led dr stewart and dr feder to accuse dr stephen oates , a massachusetts historian , of plagiarism in his popular biography of lincoln , with malice toward none dr stewart and dr feder said they found several hundred instances of copying in three of dr oates s books , some involving only a few words and others passages of more than one sentence with only minor word changes by dr oates plagiarism is denied in telephone interviews , dr oates said the identical phrasing that showed up in the computer matching was inconsequential because it was chiefly scattered phrases of no particular significance plagiarism , he said , meant copying entire sentences and paragraphs dr l earl laurence , the acting deputy director of the institute where the two work , said that he and the nih had tolerated their activities but that their most recent investigation was beyond the mission of the institute he said he and dr philip gordon , the institute s director , decided to end dr stewart s and dr feder s work the essential reason the office was closed is that their work progressively moved outside this institute s mission , authority and responsibility , dr laurence said their work is just a mismatch for what we do here there is a question of whether they have been simply doing research into scientific practices or their work is of an investigative nature i think that since their work tends to be focused on individuals , it tends to be investigative , dr laurence continued that is not appropriate , nor do they have the authority to do that in this institute it is not that they did a bad job they did well next monday they will report to new assignments dr feder will review grants , and dr stewart will be a chemist in the biophysical chemistry section the action comes a few months after other offices investigating misconduct were transferred out of the nih and marks the end of a period in which the institutes undertook their own investigations of misconduct in science chief investigator dismissed dr bernadine healy , who will leave as director of the institutes next month , earlier dismissed dr suzanne hadley , the chief investigator in the former office of scientific integrity , and later transferred that office out of the institutes it was reconstituted in the public health service as the office of research integrity earlier this year johanna schneider , a spokeswoman for dr healy , said she had no role in the decision to reassign dr stewart and dr feder the two conducted standard scientific work until 1983 , when they carried out an investigation of dr john darsee of harvard university , who was later shown by the institutes to have committed extensive fraud the two wrote articles severely critical of the way university officials first failed to investigate the darsee case , then defended dr darsee for some time before acknowledging the misconduct the result of that case and other investigations was the writing of new standards for conduct and its investigation at harvard and other universities some scientists angered dr stewart and dr feder gained the backing of many scientists as well as the house energy and commerce committee s subcommittee on oversight and investigations , which mr dingell also heads some scientists cheered them on but others have been angered by their tenacious pressing of the issue of misconduct , which they saw as raising rare and often trivial cases to the detriment of the reputation of science the two also had a long , bitter battle with dr david baltimore , the former president of rockefeller university , over the alleged fabrication of data by his colleague , dr thereza imanishikari of tufts university dr baltimore was a coauthor of a paper on immunology , published in the journal cell in 1987 , in which the allegedly fake data was presented , and he was its chief defender last year the institutes said in a preliminary report that data for the paper were fake no final report has yet been issued when asked recently about the pair s reassignment , dr baltimore told science magazine , i'm relieved he said dr stewart s and dr feder s apparent scientific rigor is nothing of the sort they do n't understand the issues they get involved in , and added , it s about time that the government realized that it was paying for this kind of antischolarship activity and shut them down
moscow , jan 3 in the old days , whenever soviet and american leaders met , the communist propaganda machine would jam up with a special kind of american fare old hollywood movies appeared on television , magazines featured happy american faces , newspapers were full of quotes from the world press assessing positively the kremlin s latest move toward peace this weekend , when president bush landed here for his first and last official visit to a democratic russia , there was no orchestrated welcome , not even an honor guard to greet him at sheremetyevo airport this summit meeting came and went with so little fanfare that many russians , celebrating the beginning of a long winter holiday , were barely aware it had taken place and yet this time , there was no mistaking the american presence , although none of the signs had anything to do with arms control or superpower summitry whether it was the line for hamburgers at mcdonald s , wrigley chewinggum ditties on television , redandwhite kiosks shaped like cocacola cans or american preachers ministering to the faithful with a russian voiceover on two moscow television channels this morning , the message was clear an american invasion of russia is under way , one that is measured not in missiles but in fast food , candy bars and videocassettes we unfortunately get the worst from you , lamented sergei , a 20yearold student , as he and his friend marina left mcdonald s this afternoon it is a negative influence it is perhaps a feature of cultural imperialism that its victims succumb willingly , even as they protest even at 345 rubles for a big mac about 5 percent of the average monthly wage the wait today outside the mcdonald s on pushkin square averaged 20 minutes , in temperatures that hovered just above zero degrees fahrenheit sveta , a 28yearold travel agent , is a frequent visitor to mcdonald s because it is convenient , good and quick , she said the last film she saw was made in hollywood , but like others , she bemoans the incursions of americana it has practically replaced russian culture , she said as for the military threat that was so greatly reduced at today s ceremonies at the kremlin , sveta , who declined to give her last name , said she had not given it a thought in years as she sees it , environmental catastrophes , disease and the threat of attacks from other countries are the real dangers of a postcoldwar world they 're at the other party under communism , christmas and new year s in russia were rolled into a smorgasbord of a holiday , a time for family gatherings and midnight revelries , when giftgiving and partying were confounded in a vodkasoaked blur now , for the second year , the russian orthodox christmas , which falls on friday , is getting its due , which means two long holiday weekends , back to back , with little time or inclination for work in between this , more than the sharp frost , was the main reason why moscow s snowy streets were practically deserted during mr bush s 24hour visit other than a cluster of antiamerican protesters at the airport , and two children waving american flags outside spaso house , the united states ambassador s residence , no one turned out to mark mr bush s last foreignpolicy triumph the only other ordinary folk to catch a glimpse of mr bush were several hundred small children , dressed in russian folk costumes , who gathered around a brightly decorated christmas tree inside the palace of congresses the crowd was being warmed up by two clowns when mr bush and president boris n yeltsin put in a brief appearance , stopping long enough for the american president to mingle with grandfather frost , the russian santa claus , and greet a small russian with high fives at the signing ceremonies , mr bush seemed slightly detached and distracted , but his eyes misted over when mr yeltsin , paying homage to his years in the white house , offered him his hand and said , thank you , george time to start planning the day before , during his stop in somalia , mr bush struck a poignant note in a talk with about 250 marines that was described by journalists traveling with him asked about his plans , the president spoke about returning to ordinary life in houston , where his wife , barbara , plans to build a new house , and about doing stuff with his 12 grandchildren i do n't really know what i will be doing , he said you see , my problem is , i thought i was going to win , so i did n't do any defense planning , you might say i plan to put something back into society , and not at the head table , not always in the glamour , certainly not with a lot of news attention try to be a useful citizen back in houston , tex , and in maine and then i 'll figure it out , mr bush said , sounding a bit like scarlett o'hara
atlanta , july 17 the arrest this week of eight white supremacists who officials said wanted to incite a race war in southern california comes at a time of rising violence by skinheads who form the shock troops for the neonazi movement in america , experts on hate groups say skinheads in this country have not previously been tied to wholesale acts of terrorism , but the federal bureau of investigation says some of those arrested in los angeles were members of a skinhead group that was plotting to bomb the first african methodist episcopal church there and shoot worshipers violence has become so ingrained in skinheads' life that a report on their activity issued by the antidefamation league of b'nai b'rith just three days before the arrests concluded the skinheads are today the most violent of all white supremacy groups not even the ku klux klans , so notorious for their use of the rope and the gun , come close to the skinheads in the number and severity of crimes committed irwin suall , factfinding director of the antidefamation league , said the los angeles charges raised the possibility that skinheads were prepared to move to more largescale violence from the random attacks on blacks , jews , homosexuals , immigrants and members of other minority groups that have resulted in 28 deaths since 1987 , 22 of them since 1990 trends toward more violence i do think we 're in a period of transition in the white supremacist movement , mr suall said clearly , there are trends within it to move toward more serious violence , to escalate the violence whether the arrests in los angeles will serve for a time at least to deter further action of that type , we 'll have to wait and see in numbers alone , skinheads are hardly a major force the antidefamation league puts the number of skinhead youths given to white supremacist ideology , overtly racist music and random violence at 3 , 300 to 3 , 500 nationwide shaved heads are prevalent , but some wear their hair longer to avoid being conspicuous mr suall said skinheads were scattered over 40 states in 160 or so groups like the confederate hammer skins , the aryan national front and the nationalist skinhead knights among those arrested in los angeles was the leader of the fourth reich skin heads danny welch , director of the klanwatch project of the southern poverty law center in montgomery , ala , which monitors and has filed numerous lawsuits against hate groups , said what makes skinheads noteworthy right now is their random violence they have been responsible for the majority of the violence committed by organized racists they get out and just beat the heck out of anybody that s a minority or anybody that does n't agree with them 'very hard to get a grip on' in some ways , the disorganized nature of skinhead groups , many of which regularly break up and reform , has kept the groups from becoming more of a force , he said at the same time , their fluid nature has made the groups harder to monitor and combat it s very hard to get a grip on , mr welch said , because they are subject to start some kind of underground or secret organization , and we wo n't know about it until the crimes have been committed to some who study hate groups , what is most worrisome is the skinhead groups' tendency to serve more established racist organizations in the los angeles case , the authorities say , the suspects were also tied to the white aryan resistance , led by tom metzger , and the church of the creator , two of the nation s most virulent hate groups and among the most aggressive in forming alliances with skinheads the loose nature of many skinhead alliances can make prosecutions difficult , and the accusations against the los angeles suspects represent somewhat uncharted territory still , those who monitor skinheads and other hate groups say they find nothing out of character in the charges none of us here were surprised , mr welch said i mean , this is the sort of thing that they 've talked about in publications this is the sort of thing that these people hear in speeches , hear behind closed doors at their private meetings this is the sort of thing they cut their teeth on other investigations aborted los angeles , july 17 \( ap \) federal agents said today that they had to throw out years of work infiltrating white supremacist groups to avert plans by the neonazi group fourth reich skin heads to bomb a black church and mail a bomb to a rabbi it was simply a matter of assessing the danger level , said assistant united states attorney marc r greenberg we felt we could no longer take the risk the fbi decided to abort several white supremacy investigations and arrest eight people after learning of the impending mail bomb attack , he said officials said they thought that publicity about the arrests might have tipped supremacists who are the targets of other investigations to the identities of the undercover agents who uncovered the bomb plot

guatemala , sept 7 president ramiro de leon carpio s attempt to purge corrupt members of congress has thrown the legislature into chaos fights have broken out in the chamber , garbage has flown from the gallery , and today , while two rival leaders fought for control of the congress , scores of peasant protesters stormed the building and occupied the 116 legislators' seats so far , however , no one has been purged i am the new president of the congress , said arturo soto aguirre , a rightwing congressman who was perhaps elected on sunday night after the incumbent , jose lobo dubon , walked out of a tumultuous session to avoid being ousted i am still the president , insisted mr lobo , a christian democrat who has been a focus of the widespread but vague allegations of legislative corruption the truth is that on sunday there was no real session because no agenda was ever approved ridiculous as the situation has become mr soto was stalking the chamber floor today while mr lobo and his bodyguards blockaded themselves in the president s office upstairs the chaos seemed only to add to the pressure on mr de leon carpio the 51yearold president , a former government human rights ombudsman , came to power suddenly in june on a wave of anticorruption sentiment the feeling was initially tapped by his predecessor , jorge serrano elias , who dissolved the congress and supreme court on may 25 in what he contended was a radical step to overhaul institutions so corrupt that they were undermining the government mr serrano s methods were roundly condemned , and he was ousted days later as he himself came under a hail of allegations of illicit enrichment while in office but his charges against the legislature and courts went almost uncontested guatemalan legislators have long been accused of activities ranging from car theft to influencepeddling but because of the political difficulty involved in canceling their legal immunity , none of at least half a dozen legal cases presented against legislators under mr serrano were ever prosecuted mr de leon carpio , who took office with support that was wide but almost entirely unorganized , initially balked at demands that he , too , take on the political parties in congress but as his popularity began to slip and other policy initiatives he had announced seemed to bog down , he reversed his course last month and began calling on the entire congress to resign according to opinion polls , public support for mr de leon carpio has soared again but only 76 legislators have agreed to submit resignations for the moment , the attempt by those members of congress to elect new leaders appeared to have been successfully blocked by mr lobo and 15 others whose removal has been demanded by a coalition of political , business and other groups the peasants who occupied the chamber today , however , protested that all of the legislators must quit this is a very difficult moment for the president , gabriel aguilera , a political scientist and a member of the coalition , said this afternoon some people want them all to go , others want only the 16 to go , and the strongest pressure is coming from those who do n't want a purge at all if the purge fails , he will be very weakened politically , he said and if the conflict is not quickly resolved , he added , the situation could become ungovernable again adding to the pressures on mr de leon carpio , his defense minister , gen mario rene enriquez , announced on monday that the army was seeking the president s authorization to move forcefully against the country s small leftist guerrilla armies general enriquez , a relative moderate , said the rebels had shown no signs of reciprocating for a reduction in offensive operations ordered by the president the new coordinator of mr de leon carpio s national peace commission , however , said in an interview today that the government was nearly finished with a new peace initiative and would present it within the next two weeks
united nations , june 18 the fighting between united nations forces and a warlord in somalia and the failure of international troops to be an effective buffer in bosnia are forcing many to rethink the organization s vastly expanded role as a global peacekeeper diplomats here have publicly complained of amateurism in the peacekeeping operations , with the united states representative , madeleine k albright , asserting recently that illequipped and often unprepared troops are often sent into the field officials in the united nations secretariat grumble that member nations are piling on tasks without providing adequate forces or money to do the jobs such recriminations by no means spell disaster for united nations peacekeeping efforts , which have been revitalized over the last few years and credited for successes like the disarmament of rebels in el salvador and the elections in cambodia last month from optimism to realism yet the view of global police work has shifted , from a mood of buoyant optimism at the united nations just a few months ago to what some are calling a new realism about the difficulties there s no question that for a while we hoped that simply by deploying forces a solution would magically emerge , a european diplomat said but it does n't work that way ms albright endorsed the concept of multilateral action in a speech to the council on foreign relations on june 11 , saying , but she harshly criticized the way united nations peacekeeping efforts were organized , saying many of the 13 operations mounted in the last five years had been hampered by a neartotal absence of contingency planning , hasty recruitment and a byzantine and drawnout budgetary decision making process a new cooperation the criticism is a change for an organization that only a year or so ago was basking in its growing responsibilities for decades the security council had been paralyzed by coldwar competition between the soviet union and the united states , both of which had veto power in the council s decisions but the collapse of communism and the fading of the superpowers' arms race opened the way for new cooperation , leading to internationally brokered accords in cambodia and angola some analysts worry that the organization s involvement in so many conflicts could land it in quagmires reminiscent of the united states experience in vietnam the possibilities for going wrong are numerous and the costs potentially openended , laurence martin , the director of the institute of international affairs in london , writes in the latest issue of the national interest , a quarterly journal 'an endless agenda' he was speaking particularly of the security council s willingness to send peacekeepers into countries riven by domestic conflicts that the united nations had previously tended to avoid , like the ethnic fighting in bosnia or the anarchy in somalia to try to protect national minorities and to build governments where there are none is to accept an endless agenda and to assume the task of state and communitybuilding on a vast scale , he said of the last nine peacekeeping operations authorized by the security council , seven have involved internal wars most of the previous missions were aimed at preventing further conflict between two countries , like monitoring the border between iraq and kuwait as its missions expand , the troops under united nations command have expanded from just 11 , 500 at the beginning of 1992 to roughly 80 , 000 now , according to the united nations under secretary general for peacekeeping , kofi annan of ghana that number is expected to grow to nearly 100 , 000 once forces have been recruited to protect the six bosnian safe areas designated this month by the security council donors slow to pay but officials at the united nations say it has become increasingly difficult to persuade countries to contribute modern specialized forces in another obstacle , the main donor nations are behind by 12 billion in their peacekeeping payments , with the united states alone owing 312 million united states officials , using different accounting procedures , say the figure owed is more like 40 million , but the clinton administration has vowed to pay the full united states assessment with the united nations engaged in so many operations around the world , the impression has been created that it is doing exactly what it was set up to do , but it is all very fragile , mr annan said in an interview complicating the task is what secretary general boutros boutrosghali , with a touch of irony , has called the excessive credibility that the organization has gained there is a naivete that believes the united nations is capable of just walking in and solving all problems , one official here said , speaking on condition of anonymity and then , at the other end of the spectrum , there is cynicism , a tendency of countries to dump responsibility on the united nations simply to show their publics that they are doing something little decisive action the most frequently cited example is bosnia and herzegovina , where western nations have refrained from direct military intervention to halt ethnic cleansing by serbian nationalists the united states and other countries have solemnly approved one resolution after another imposing economic sanctions and declaring safe havens , but little decisive action has been taken
to the editor reports of the demise of the space shuttle are greatly exaggerated , as mark twain might say a redesigned space station may indeed cut the number of space shuttle missions but the shuttle will continue to be a workhorse for the united states space program and its myriad missions for years to come ask president clinton ask dan goldin , the national aeronautics and space administrator ask congress most important , ask the american people , who continue to provide strong support for the shuttle program unfortunately , some accept the exaggerated and grossly misleading findings of a group of academicians who claim each shuttle launch costs 17 billion that figure is vastly distorted , for it unrealistically includes the cost of development incurred over more than 30 years in fact , the general accounting office , the investigative arm of congress , has reported that the average cost of a shuttle flight is 4135 million and that the marginal costs of reducing the number of shuttle flights saves only 44 million a flight to suggest that taxpayers could save billions by reducing or canceling shuttle flights is seriously misleading the shuttle has the highest launch success rate of any manned or unmanned vehicle , including international vehicles it also is costcompetitive with other launch alternatives based on dollars per pound to low earth orbit furthermore , none of the alternative launch vehicles matches the shuttle in its payload lift capacity , onorbit servicing , in repair and recovery of satellites and in returning cargos to earth americans are not willing to abandon a space program that has expanded our knowledge of the universe , enhanced our technological competitiveness and rewarded us with breakthroughs that have improved the quality of life here on earth the shuttle will continue to deliver those benefits , and at increasingly lower costs , well into the next century sam f iacobellis exec vice president rockwell international seal beach , calif , april 1 , 1993
there are two types of bathroom sinks one is freestanding , which is mounted directly on a wall and sometimes supported by legs or a pedestal , and the other is the vanity sink , which is attached to or part of a vanity top installing a vanity sink is fairly easy , but installing a freestanding one can be more challenging to remove a sink before installing a new one , first shut off the water supplying the faucets or the main valve near the water meter next , open the faucets to drain remaining water then use a basin wrench to loosen the nuts beneath the sink that fasten the supply tubes to the faucet s base to use a basin wrench , fit it around the nut so that turning the handle counterclockwise tightens the jaw otherwise , the tool will slip if the nuts are corroded , spray them liberally with penetrating oil like liquid wrench or wd40 allow the oil to work for about a halfhour before trying again water usually fills the supply tubes , so be prepared to wipe up spills if water oozes from the tubes because of faulty shutoff valves , close the main water supply valve to halt the problem install new shutoff valves when plumbing the new sink use channellocking pliers or a pipe wrench to loosen the slip nuts at both ends of the drain pipe s trap portion , and then remove the trap it , too , contains water if the trap has a cleanout plug in the base , remove it and let the water drain into a bucket or jar before disconnecting the trap otherwise , hold the trap upright when removing it and then pour out the contents with the sink freed from the plumbing , a vanity type , depending on its design , can be removed by unscrewing from beneath the top the clips that hold it in place that can be accomplished by pushing the sink upward if there are no clips but if the sink and top are one piece , unscrew the top from the vanity s base and remove the entire unit if the sink is freestanding , look for horizontal bolts at the rear , which hold the sink against the wall remove them with a wrench , using penetrating oil , if necessary if the sink is on a pedestal , remove any bolts joining the two parts in all cases , lift the sink to free it from the wall mount legs can be unscrewed and removed afterward if a pedestal does not come away freely , look for a bolt in the base anchoring it to the floor when choosing a new sink , check the roughin dimensions supplied with it to be sure that its drain opening will align with the drain pipe in the wall or floor there also may be other vital specifications before installing a new sink install the drain tube in the base , because that would more difficult if it is put in later installing the faucets beforehand also simplifies that job but that is not advisable on vanity sinks fastened with clips , as they have to be turned upside down during installation to install a vanity sink that mounts in a hole in the vanity top , follow the directions that come with the sink use an electric saber saw to cut the hole in the top if the sink requires clips , turn it upside down , spread adhesive caulking around the underside of the rim and fit the vanity top , also turned upside down , over the sink tighten the clips fasten the top and sink as a unit to the base if the sink is heavy and clips are not needed , attach the vanity top to the base first apply adhesive caulking around the opening and lower the sink into place while supporting it with your hands from below press around the rim to spread the compound to install sinks that are molded into a vanity top , attach the top to the base if replacing a freestanding sink with another , you may be able to mount it on the wall bracket of the original , but check before removing the bracket from the wall if the sink requires a different bracket , remove the original and attach a new one with screws at the height in the instructions installing a freestanding sink against a wall where none has been requires cutting into the wall and attaching a sturdy brace of 1 x 6inch lumber flush with the studs the brace is then covered with wallboard to hide it , and the bracket is attached to the surface the instructions supplied with the sink will specify how high the brace has to be from the floor draw lines indicating its top and bottom on the wall and use a wallboard saw to cut outside the lines but parallel to them , starting from a point between the studs and sawing toward each side when you reach the studs , cut through the wallboard covering them with a utility knife saw vertically along the outside of the studs to complete the cutout save the piece to use as a patch after the brace is installed notch the edges of the studs with a chisel so that the brace fits flush with or slightly below their surfaces then fasten the brace to the studs with 2inch no 8 flathead wood screws , two at each end patch the hole in the wallboard , and attach the bracket use a level to be certain that it is horizontal fasten the bracket with at least four 1 1 2inch no 8 woodscrews hang the sink from the bracket , which should support its weight install auxiliary legs , if desired , and connect the faucet and drain if the sink will rest on a pedestal , connect the plumbing before installing diagrams with a freestanding sink , look for horizontal bolts at the rear and remove them with a wrench the mounting bracket attaches to where a brace of lumber has been placed flush with the studs
transit authority engineers have fixed 110 subway cars that were braking to a halt in emergencies well outside safety limits and have begun examining the emergency brakes of the system s other classes of cars , all of which in recent tests failed to meet their specifications , the authority said yesterday the agency said it was not necessary to pull the cars out of service immediately because the signal system has a builtin margin of safety to allow for the possibility that trains might not stop within their specified braking distance all the others are within the safety cushion , so that sense of urgency is n't there , said caren gardner , a spokeswoman for the authority officials from riders' advocacy groups agreed that there was no immediate need to fix the cars that were braking outside specifications but within the safety cushion but they expressed alarm that the brakes of 110 of the transit authority s 5 , 500 cars had deteriorated to the point that they could have caused serious accidents i 'd use the word lucky , and we 've lucked out often , said stephen b dobrow , an electrical engineer who is the president of the committee for better transit , a nonprofit watchdog group i do n't know how long the luck holds out call for more testing he said the failure to catch the faulty brakes earlier revealed flaws in the transit authority s preventative maintenance programs maybe these programs should require testing of certain essential devices , such as a braking distance test , he said ms gardner said the transit authority does not routinely test braking distance instead , she said , workers check brake components , like brake shoes , during routine maintenance of the cars and replace them as necessary engineers began testing the emergency braking distance of all 14 classes of subway cars after a train on the franklin avenue shuttle failed to stop one day in late january , rolling right into the bumper block at the end of its track and jumping the rails , ms gardner said none of the passengers were injured , she said the engineers discovered that none of the emergency brakes , which are used not only in emergencies but also to provide the final 5 to 10 percent of normal braking power , were stopping the trains within transit authority specifications but because the transit authority tacks on a safety cushion equal to 35 percent of the specified braking distance , most of the cars were not posing a threat to passengers , ms gardner said problem with r42s but 110 cars did pose a potential threat those cars , called r42s , were stopping an average of 465 percent beyond the specified distance at 30 miles per hour , the cars were supposed to stop within 245 feet instead , they were stopping at 359 feet , ms gardner said no crashes were caused by the defective brakes , she said in all , there are 336 r42s , 75foot silver cars built in 1969 when the cars were overhauled in 1988 and 1989 , new brake systems were installed by two different companies , ms gardner said all 110 defective systems were installed by the new york air brake company , she said , adding that the transit authority has contacted the company about the problem , which was reported yesterday in the daily news and new york newsday officials of the new york air brake company could not be reached for comment the defective cars , which are used on the j , l , m and z lines , were taken out of service thursday night , and engineers quickly identified the problem unlike the normal breaking system , which is magnetic , the emergency brakes are friction brakes clamps , powered by air pressure , that grip the rails engineers discovered that the problem lay in the variable load valve , the device that regulates air pressure in the brakes , ms gardner said with their air pressure adjusted , the cars will be back in service in time for the tuesday morning rush hour because of the holiday and the use of spare cars , the repair work on the r42s did not result in delays , she said having dealt with those cars that were stopping outside the margin of safety , engineers have begun examining the other cars , ranking them according to how far below specifications they are performing what we 've done is to prioritize the system , ms gardner said the engineers will tinker with the break shoes and air pressure in an effort to cut the braking distance , she said
a nationwide shortage of nitroglycerin , a heart drug taken by hundreds of thousands of americans to relieve pains from angina , has developed because of a manufacturing problem at a plant owned by the pill s only american maker the nitroglycerin pills are sold as nitrostat by parkedavis , a division of the warnerlambert company of morris plains , nj problems at the plant in puerto rico began in november and have since been corrected , said peter wolf , a company spokesman the shortage has caught many patients by surprise , forcing them to scramble for a supply or to call their doctors to seek alternative therapies the shortage has surfaced in many cities but seems to have left others unaffected even in areas with shortages , some pharmacies said they had supplies for several weeks but warnerlambert sent a letter yesterday to 150 , 000 doctors and pharmacists saying the tablets may be unavailable for several weeks mr wolf attributed the situation to problems in switching from an older manufacturing process but he offered no explanation why the old machines could not be used until the problem with the new ones was solved varying levels of shortages , dwindling supplies or warnings of shortages were evident in telephone interviews with pharmacists around the country , including new york telephone calls to 10 randomly selected pharmacies in atlanta yielded only one store with a supply problem , and that store had a problem only with one of the three dosage levels in which the pills are supplied but eight out of 10 pharmacies called in northern virginia reported that they had trouble obtaining nitrostat or did not have the medicine in stock customers turned away in los angeles , 17 of 20 los angeles pharmacies said they were out of the drug , and the other three said they had limited supplies some large healthcare organizations said they had sufficient stockpiles to prevent shortages , but some neighborhood pharmacies reported turning away regular customers some doctors , pharmacists and patients said they were concerned or angered by warnerlambert s belated disclosure of its problems dr adolf hutter , the president of the american college of cardiology , said he was deeply concerned about a sudden cutoff of the supply of one of the most important drugs in medicine , which is used to relieve the crushing chest pains caused by an inadequate supply of oxygenated blood to the heart he said steps should be taken to prevent a recurrence the food and drug administration is referring queries about nitrostat to warnerlamber , according to an agency spokeswoman , susan cruzan as the corporate and government aspects of the problem were unfolding , worries were expressed by consumers in miami , digna palencia , a 62yearold nurse s aide , said in a telephone interview conducted in spanish that she had the pills on hand but was very worried about falling short having them available gives me peace of mind , she said in houston , john sacaris , owner of peterson s pharmacy , said , it s one of those things that you never think of being out of it warnerlambert and medical leaders said individuals who are running low on nitrostat should seek a supply at drug stores that still have a supply or call their doctors for a prescription for an alternative drug possible alternatives among the alternatives suggested by doctors and warnerlambert were using nitroglycerin in a spray form and substituting different forms of nitrates for nitrostat cardiologists said that although such measures should be effective for most individuals using nitrostat , they are not a perfect solution for some patients it may be difficult to switch quickly from one drug to another nitroglycerin patches are available but are aimed primarily at prevention , not treatment mr wolf said that fresh supplies should reach pharmacies by the end of next week the drug comes in three doses , and the two lowest , the 03milligram and 04milligram forms , should be on druggists' shelves soonest , mr wolf said a third dose is 06 milligram in a normal month , the company ships 330 , 000 bottles of 100 pills each , mr wolf said , but he could not say how many fewer had been shipped since the problems at the factory began mr wolf conceded that warnerlambert should have sent out letters sooner about the nitrostat problem , which he said was unrelated to safety or health concerns nitroglycerin pills , which are put under the tongue , are an extremely important drug because they are the fastest way to stop the crushing chest pains from angina , dr hutter , a cardiologist at the massachusetts general hospital in boston , said nitroglycerin pills , he added , literally can be lifesaving by shutting off a process that can progress into a heart attack nitrogylcerin has been used in medicine since 1847 in recent years , doctors have used it in new ways like patches to prevent angina pains although other drugs have been developed to treat heart disease , nitroglycerin is the best drug we have right now to immediately relieve an angina attack , said dr peter pasternack , a cardiologist at new york university medical center he said he was concerned about patients' becoming anxious and aggravating angina because they could not obtain pills dr pasternack was among doctors and pharmacists who said they were surprised that only one company now made nitroglycerin pills dr roy schwarz , a vice president of the american medical association in chicago , said patients who could not get a new supply of nitrostat should not switch drugs on their own but should go to their doctor to find an alternative 'they are pretty upset' stuart pomper , a pharmacist at sm pharmacy on main street in flushing , queens , said since the middle to late december , there has been none around i have to tell my patients that there is none around they are pretty upset michael somma , owner of artis drugs in middle village , queens , said i , fortunately , bought up as much of it as i could but we 'll be out within a matter of days it s been apparent on a retail level for at least a month ira stern , a pharmacist at robert s drugs in miami , said that when there was a potential shortfall , the manufacturer would usually warn distributors , who pass the message on to the pharmacies the manufacturers thus make sure there is an even distribution to avoid regional shortfalls he is worried that patients will make a run on drugstores because of the publicity this is such an important drug that people panic when they think it might not be available , he said

washington , nov 21 weary house democrats late tonight narrowly quelled an internal revolt against their leadership s plan to overhaul campaign spending laws , but the effort left them so spent that they quit for the night , leaving passage of the measure something less than assured that left the principal vote on approving the package for monday , with virtually all the chamber s republicans and a fair number of democrats still opposed to many of the measure s most important provisions after a night in which top house democrats scrambled to the last minute for support , the lawmakers refused by a margin of 220 to 207 to let a dissident democrat , representative mike synar of oklahoma , offer a rival campaignspending proposal that could well have doomed his superiors' intricate plan hey , man , they 're throwing everything at me , mr synar said early in the day it s handtohand combat in the trenches the synar bill would have embarrassed president clinton , who has called overhauling the campaignfinancing laws one of his administration s chief goals the democratic leadership and president clinton support the house bill , a true grabbag of election overhauls that includes voluntary limits on campaign spending , curbs on unregulated contributions and taxpayer financing for candidates' purchases of advertising stark differences with senate even if the house passes a version of campaign reform , it is not at all clear that it can be successfully mated with a wholly different version that the senate passed after a long republican filibuster in june mr synar , who offered a simpler package of curbs on political action committees and wealthy donors , called the bill a sham intended to help incumbent democrats and said the republicans' alternative was no better not one campaign race will be any cheaper or any fairer if either of these bills pass , he said both bills are so clearly unconstitutional that it begs the question of the sincerity of either of the parties indeed , he and his backers noted , the leadership s caps on campaign spending would allow candidates to spend up to 1 million on an election more than twice the median for house races moreover , the measure would not take effect until the congress passed a separate bill , yet to be written , that would set up a federal fund to pay for campaign advertising the measure s principal sponsor , representative sam gejdenson of connecticut , allowed that the proposal was not perfect but he said it does what is important and what is needed , and gives everyone a chance to run for congress instead of merely the welloff the bill now before the house drafted after a summer of excruciating negotiations tries to curb what many democrats see as some of the political system s worst excesses , but leaves some of the most beloved vices relatively intact backers depict the measure as an eightlane highway of good intentions it would address a signal problem in politics , the exploding cost of running for office , by allowing for voluntary campaign spending limits of 600 , 000 , adjusted for inflation , or 800 , 000 for candidates who waged hotly contested and expensive primary races candidates who agreed to abide by the limit , and then exceeded it , would be liable for a fine candidates would have an incentive to accept the spending limits those who did would be awarded up to 200 , 000 in socalled communications vouchers , applicable to bills for radio or television time , print advertisements or other means of reaching voters the total value of the vouchers would equal the total contributions from individual donors , to a maximum of 200 per donor the aim would be to give candidates an incentive to raise money from large numbers of small donors , since those donations could be largely matched by the vouchers the bill also addresses another perceived flaw , the influence of political action committees and rich contributors , by capping political action committee donations at 200 , 000 per candidate , and limiting large individual donations that is , donations exceeding 200 to a total of 200 , 000 both those limits would cover an entire election cycle , including both primary and general election campaigns the measure also seeks to limit outside interests from mounting independent campaigns on behalf of or against an alreadydeclared candidate the bill tries to choke off financing for such campaigns by making it illegal for anyone who has given money to a declared candidate to then give money to an independent campaign involved in the same election race aiming at soft money' the bill also tries to rein in unregulated soft money by requiring that all money spent on federal elections be raised under federal rules and law that would prohibit the parties and big donors from raising and shoveling millions of dollars into state and local parties' getoutthevote efforts that are actually illdisguised expenses on behalf of federal candidates instead , the measure would set up a federally regulated grassroots fund in each state that would be devoted to efforts by state parties to help federal candidates
miami , dec 22 alarmed by a surge in juvenile crime , including attacks on tourists , governments throughout florida are moving to impose curfews on teenagers but police departments have reservations about the idea , and civil liberties groups as well as young people are protesting in the latest such instance , the dade county commission last week approved , on a vote of 11 to 1 , a draft proposal that would prohibit youths under 16 from being on the streets of miami or any other city in florida s most populous county after midnight on fridays and saturdays and after 11 pm on all other nights a final vote on the measure is scheduled for jan 18 if passed , as seems virtually certain , it would take effect late next month push for statewide curfew the dade county measure was inspired by a dallas curfew that was upheld by a federal appeals court last month in addition to dallas , several other large cities around the country , including atlanta , hartford , milwaukee , newark and phoenix , already have curfews , although the degree of restrictions and the level of enforcement vary from city to city according to the national conference of state legislatures , the only state with a curfew is hawaii , which requires children under 16 to be off the streets after 10 pm but support for a statewide curfew has been growing in florida since september , when , in a crime that drew international attention and became a symbol of rising juvenile violence , a british tourist was shot to death at a highway rest stop outside tallahassee during a bungled robbery attempt four teenagers , ranging in age from 13 to 16 , were arrested and charged with the killing , which occurred at 2 20 am on a school night the mother of two of the arrested youths was widely condemned after telling reporters that she did not know where her sons were on the night of the killing , saying , i do n't follow my kids around state figures show that 149 juveniles were charged with murder or manslaughter in florida last year , compared with 69 a decade earlier during the same period , attemptedmurder cases involving juveniles rose to 249 from 13 , armedrobbery cases to 1 , 972 from 645 , and aggravated assault or battery cases to 7 , 083 from 2 , 688 citing that rise in juvenile crime , florida s attorney general , bob butterworth , last week proposed statewide legislation even more sweeping than the county ordinance that has won preliminary approval here in a letter to a state commission studying ways to overhaul florida s judicial system , he recommended a weeknight curfew of 10 pm for youths under 16 and an 11 pm curfew for those under 18 in addition , tampa s city council , despite reservations by the city s legal affairs and police departments , recently gave preliminary approval to a plan similar to miami s the council is expected to pass a final version of the bill on thursday and the tourist mecca of orlando , citing incidents in which armed or drunken bands of youths have attacked nighttime visitors downtown , is also considering a curfew there are few , if any , prospective florida visitors anywhere in the world who have not heard recently of attacks in which 10 tourists were killed in less than a year , mr butterworth wrote to members of the state commission i think they would welcome news that florida takes very seriously its responsibility to insure that minors are where they belong police are lukewarm mr butterworth , a former judge , sheriff and prosecutor , said the proposal is intended to help remove our children from the grasp of violence and criminality and to give concerned parents an important new tool to assist them in rearing and nurturing their children in addition , he said , it would help the police in efforts to protect both our lawabiding citizens and our visitors there is little historical evidence that curfews succeed in suppressing juvenile crime , or fail to suppress it lawenforcement officials and criminologists say that because the big cities that impose curfews have adopted them only in the last few years , there has not been enough time to fully measure their effect in any case , lawenforcement agencies around florida have been lukewarm , at best , to curfew proposals several police chiefs , arguing that their officers are already overworked and bogged down with paperwork , complain that they do not have the money , the time or the manpower to enforce such legislation during discussion of the ordinance here , county commissioners learned that three cities in dade county in fact already had curfews but that because of other demands on officers and concerns about the legality of the statutes , none of the cities had been enforcing the restrictions consistently that i know of , no action has ever been taken against anyone , said jose caragol , a spokesman for the police department in hialeah a curfew there , he said , has never been enforced because two years ago a state court declared a similar ordinance in nearby miami springs unconstitutional opposed by aclu
buffalo , july 12 the cuban pitcher who deserted his team during the world university games now under way in buffalo surfaced today at a spanishlanguage radio station in miami , saying he had dreamed of defecting for months and now wants to become a major leaguer and , according to el nuevo herald , the spanishlanguage edition of the miami herald , another cuban player defected today reilando ordonez perreira , a cuban shortstop , has planned a news conference on another miami spanishlanguage radio station , wcmq , on wednesday , the herald reported the other player , edilberto oropesa , 23 , defected over the weekend he said he had considered taking the action for some time for months before in training , every night i was thinking about it , the associated press quoted oropesa as saying , through a translator on radio mambi lastminute secret he said he did n't tell anyone until saturday while talking with his cousin through a chainlink fence at sal maglie stadium in niagara falls , ny , where the cuban team was about to play a game he told me , 'i want to stay here , ' the cousin , leo landlin , told the associated press i told him , 'how are we going to do this \? ' and he goes , 'i'm going to jump the fence' i told him , 'you ca n't jump the fence look how high it is' it was like 10 or 12 feet high oropesa said my cousin was telling me to go around to the shorter fence i told him 'no way i'm jumping right here' the pitcher did just that and jumped into a waiting car oropesa said he will seek asylum in the united states he also said his role model is another cuban defector , rene arocha , a starting pitcher for the st louis cardinals oropesa left his team two years to the day after arocha defected in miami it s the dream of every cuban ballplayer to make it to the big leagues , oropesa said oropesa , who played for the team from matanzas province , is not as highly regarded as arocha , who pitched for the cuban national team ordonez perreira is also not highly regarded us women holding court buffalo , july 12 three games into the schedule and in the second round of the women s basketball tournament at the world university games , the united states women s team is still on track to defend its gold medal although it was n't as easy today as it might have been the americans shot only 24 for 69 , but still went on to defeat russia , 7255 , at the koessler center at canisius college the united states holds a 40 record at the university games , having also defeated israel , chinese taipei and ukraine russia \( 22 \) employed a matchup zone defense , which had a lot to do with the united states' poor shooting \( including 0 for 11 from 3point range \) the american team made only 3 of its first 15 shots of the four opponents the united states has faced so far , the russians have given them the toughest time similarly , it was the unified team in the 1992 summer olympics that upset the american women in the semifinals and went on to win the gold although none of the players from the russian team played on the olympic team , they have international experience the united states trailed at the beginning of the game but slowly made its way past the russians , leading by 3628 by halftime i was definitely surprised the game was that close , but we switched a couple of our defenses that just created havoc on them , said joan bonvicini , the university of arizona coach who is coaching the americans eventually our defense wore them out and our depth really showed because we were able to get fresh people out but i am not pleased with the win it definitely was n't pretty adrienne goodson of old dominion led the united states with 20 points
reality governed rhetoric in mario cuomo s 11th annual address to the state legislature with no money around and none in sight , the governor kept his proposals and promises to a minimum the result was an unusually flat presentation for the grandiloquent mr cuomo he missed a chance to set an overarching theme for the new year but he was wise not to raise false hopes for a recessionweary state his most provocative proposal was to let local school districts finance their share of education costs through local income taxes instead of property taxes that would n't cost the state anything , but is likely to spark more debate than change another proposal would create jobs by spending 25 billion on infrastructure over five years that sounds original , but it includes the metropolitan transportation authority s pending capital program as well as already allocated federal highway money mr cuomo also called for reforms to eliminate excessive borrowing , a fairer allocation of state education funds and further streamlining of some state agencies he has n't put much muscle behind such worthy proposals in the past maybe this year will be different he said he would oppose higher broadbased taxes like income taxes but if the state is facing a budget gap of up to 4 billion , mr cuomo will need to explain how he expects to avoid them after several bruising budget years , can new yorkers afford more service cuts \? mr cuomo s budget , due in two weeks , will no doubt reveal more the governor s message has often been a dazzling exercise in the art of broadbrushing this year , he made references to what he called the new york proposition opportunity , liberty , responsibility and family otherwise he was all business after all , the republicans he loves to beat up on are leaving the white house and mr cuomo no longer flirts with national office he may also have sensed that grand flourishes would be inconsistent with modest times
foxfire confessions of a girl gang by joyce carol oates 328 pages dutton a william abrahams book 21 norman mailer once observed that most writers have a handful of ideas , and that they spend their careers reinventing these same ideas over and over again certainly this has been true of joyce carol oates and her everexpanding oeuvre though her 20odd novels have embraced a variety of genres \( from the gothic romance to the postmodern detective story , from the contemporary family saga to the behindtheheadlines novel \) , though they have examined different classes and have taken place in different centuries , they have all shared a preoccupation with certain recurrent themes the violence and unpredictability of american life the undercurrents of guilt , passion and jealousy that run beneath the seemingly placid surface of daily life the role that fate and simple accidents play in the shaping of ordinary lives ms oates s latest novel foxfire is no exception like them \( 1969 \) , you must remember this \( 1987 \) and because it is bitter , and because it is my heart \( 1990 \) , the novel focuses on a girl s \( in this case , several girls' \) sexual and emotional coming of age like those earlier books , the novel juxtaposes scenes of gothic horror the gang rape of a dwarf woman in a remote farmhouse , the kidnapping and murder of a wealthy businessman with more mundane descriptions of everyday life this time around , however , the results feel oddly strained and contrived the intimate sense of emotional relationships found in these previous books by ms oates has been replaced by a more detached , schematic rendering of lives running out of control as a consequence , the central characters seem less like fleshandblood individuals than like predictable stereotypes maddy , the narrator of foxfire , is now a middleaged woman , recounting her memories of belonging to a girl gang named foxfire her account takes place in the 1950 s in a small upstate new york town at the age of 14 , maddy became foxfire s official historian she was the nice girl in the gang , the one who got good grades in school and who ultimately declined to participate in the gang s more outrageous schemes margaret \( or legs as she was known \) was the bad girl in the gang , the daring ringleader and provocateur , who dreamed up the group s bizarre initiation rites and its criminal scams for making money she served time in the red bank state correctional facility for stealing a car and pulling a knife at school , and she preached to the other girls a hodgepodge credo of marxist class warfare and feminist liberation foxfire s other members included rita , the school s favorite scapegoat and victim , who was teased and molested by the neighborhood boys until foxfire avenged her sufferings , and violet , a beautiful , boycrazy girl , who became one of the gang s most fervent members in its earliest incarnation , foxfire served as a kind of defense committee , committed to protecting and avenging its members acting together in secret , the girls humiliated a teacher who had tried to take advantage of rita , and succeeded in driving him from town the girls also exposed and embarrassed another man , who had tried to extract sexual favors from maddy as time passed , the gang began to extrapolate its anger from particular men to men as a species to raise money , the girls began a game of hooking that is , they 'd flirt with men they had met in a bar , a bus station , a hotel the minute one of them responded with a proposition , the girls would hold him up for money by revealing that they were underage one foxfire motto , maddy recalls , was men are the enemy ! this hectoring tone gradually infects the entire novel , turning the story of maddy and legs into a clumsy allegory about the victimization of women and their revenge through sisterhood and violence as related by ms oates , none of the encounters between the foxfire girls and the assorted men they meet feel remotely believable in each instance , the men are depicted as cartoon characters , as predatory , sexual beasts intent on preying on young women in each instance , the exchanges between them and the foxfire girls immediately devolve into physical sexual warfare given the fact that foxfire is set in the early 50 s , long before the women s movement colored the vocabulary used to describe the battle between the sexes , the language used by the foxfire girls sounds strangely rhetorical and phony it s a state of undeclared war , says legs , them hating us , men hating us no matter our age or who the hell we are but nobody wants to admit it , not even us with its dramatic ending which depicts a car flying off a bridge foxfire seems to want to be a 50 s version of thelma and louise it wants to be a feminist parable about women refusing to be doormats and seizing control of their lives unfortunately , ms oates s rendering of this story is so contrived and portentous that the reader neither buys her simplistic message nor cares about her fictional creations foxfire is a dud photo of joyce carol oates
the man fighting mike tyson s battle was balding , middleaged , wore glasses and arrived on the scene monday wearing a rumpled trench coat over a dark suit and carrying a black briefcase there was a time not long ago when mike tyson could handsomely fight his own battles , bounding into the ring wearing black trunks and black boxing shoes and 10ounce gloves that s all no robe , no hood , no socks , even he always appeared more than eager to get on with the task of knocking someone s head off now mike tyson , who once called himself the baddest dude on the planet \( with documentation to make that case \) , had placed his considerable self in the hands of the man in the trench coat , alan dershowitz , the renowned attorney from boston the scene of conflict was not a prize ring but a grandiose appeals court in the indiana state capitol building in indianapolis then dershowitz , with trench coat aside , stood before a panel of three judges to deliver his opinion that , in effect , the former heavyweight champion had been railroaded last year in his conviction of having raped desiree washington dershowitz stood not under the glare of ring lights , as his client had done so often , but under a great chandelier that hung from the high ceiling dershowitz headed a team including three other attorneys seeking a reversal of the conviction , thus opening the way for a new trial but if washington did not want to proceed \( the prosecution would surely accede to her wish \) , then tyson , serving a sixyear sentence in the indiana youth center in nearby plainfield , would be released , and able once again , at age 26 , to pursue his boxing career and raise havoc with the bowes and lewises of the world as of now , he is eligible for parole in march 1995 dershowitz s arguments centered on the conduct of the trial by judge patricia gifford his strongest elements concerned new witnesses and the alleged perjury of washington washington and her family , as well as the prosecuters , had improperly withheld information regarding financial motives , said tyson s defense , though in the trial the defense had often made reference to possible financial motives five months before the trial , the washingtons had signed an agreement with an attorney for contingency fees the washingtons said it was to ward off the media the defense says it was clearly for financial motives regarding possible movie and book offers but it was only after the trial that the agreement surfaced as for the socalled surprise witnesses , they were announced by the defense on the eighth day of the trial these witnesses , the defense said , could reasonably infer that the complaining witness has not told the truth but judge gifford excluded their testimony the witnesses , three women , said they saw two people in the back seat of a limousine who were all over one another outside of the canterbury hotel where , in tyson s room shortly after , it was charged by washington that he raped her the truth , said dershowitz in quoting the women , was that this gives credence to tyson s position that washington went to his room knowingly and willingly , and that they would have sex and her actions , said dershowitz , are at the core of the issue of consent legal scholars generally agree that the judge erred in not allowing the three witnesses but w andrew kerr , professor of law at indiana university , wonders if , upon reading the shaky evidence , that it was not harmless error on the part of the judge and thereby would have had no effect on the outcome of the trial but dershowitz s claim remains impressive the jury may not have had all necessary tools to reach their decision why were n't these three women allowed to testify \? judge gifford said that they were not on the defense s original witness list she added that the defense already had two other witnesses on the scene who had been questioned by the defense on the same information possessed by the new witnesses none of this tells us in the end whether washington s no in the hotel room meant yes , but it does say that tyson could not pursue every avenue of escape in his trial as a layman , but from what would seem to be the defendant s perspective , it seems that when someone is on trial , he ought to get the benefit of all reasonable support under that reasoning , the credibility of those witnesses perhaps should have been left to the jury to decide three appellate judges will take an estimated two months to weigh the arguments meanwhile , inmate no 922335 in the indiana youth center , who once proclaimed himself the baddest dude on the planet , waits anxiously photo mike tyson \( associated press \)
mountain view , calif , april 2 as the senate armed services committee considered whether to open the military to avowed homosexuals , a group of flight instructors at the moffett field naval air station wondered last week why nobody had asked what they thought they were the test cases , after all , said these members of patrol squadron 31 , a training unit that prepares students to fly submarinehunting p3 orions , because they work sidebyside with keith meinhold , a gay sailor who successfully challenged the military ban and was reinstated last winter by a federal judge had they had a chance to testify in washington , these men said , they would have told senator sam nunn , the georgia democrat who heads the committee , that there was less commotion in hangar 1 than there was a few months back but that things were still tense initially , it was 'oh my god , this guy s a queer , ' but that s somewhat subsided , said one supervisor it still might bother people , but they 're not as forward about it concerns of colleagues they would have also told the committee that they wished mr meinhold would abandon his public crusade because the magazine covers and television talk shows are a constant reminder that things are not as they once were and they would have said that they preferred a closeted gay colleague to an open one because now mr meinhold mades jokes with sexual overtones that might be intended to put them at their ease but instead made them uncomfortable but above all , the flight instructors here said , some tentative supporters of mr meinhold and others outright hostile , they would have told the committee that the experts and analysts in washington were doing too much talking about civil rights and not enough talking about billeting the people at my level are not concerned with what middle america thinks , said one electronics instructor , who like all but one of the halfdozen people interviewed insisted that his name not be used because the navy had urged these men to keep silent all we want to know is who we 'll be sleeping next to next week this is a shorebased squadron , made up of senior personnel , many of whom live in civilian housing and are unlikely to be deployed yet the men seem consumed with worry that they will have to bunk next to a homosexual , or rear their children in base housing next to a gay couple if president clinton lifts the 50yearold ban , which he is expected to do in some form next summer clues on homosexuality in our sort of environment we 're 9to5 people it s not all that hard to get along , said tom poulson , an instructor who said he had long guessed mr meinhold was gay because of his that boy license plates and his multicolored inbox but i do n't know about a ship or living next door i like keith and everything , but i do n't think his life style is right i 'll work with him , but i do n't want to associate with him out of work even in a situation where sleeping and showering arrangements are not an issue , the quarters are too close for some for a while , after a federal district judge had temporarily reinstated mr meinhold and before that order became permanent , navy officials here gave coworkers and students the option of not flying or studying with the 12yearveteran one supervisor said that some of those who opted out were unwilling to risk the inevitable incidental contact in a small aircraft or flight simulator they did n't want to touch him , like he had cooties , the supervisor said one radar instructor who elected not to fly with mr meinhold said the gay airman s presence in the cockpit would distract him from his responsibilities i 'd rather have my whole thinking on the safety of the flight and not what he just said and why did he say it , said the instructor , who compared his shock at learning there was a gay sailor in his midst to a woman discovering a man in the ladies' restroom the men who were the least concerned about physical proximity to mr meinhold were those who had known him longest , but they remained wary of getting too close to an unfamiliar gay sailor i 'd have no problem sleeping next to keith , because i trust him , said a radar operator , who has worked with him for a halfdozen years he knows i'm married he knows that s not my thing i know he would n't try anything on me but you never know about other people who come in session on grievances the six men interviewed were approached by mr meinhold and asked if they wanted to share their views they had previously told him , at a gripe session attended by some 25 coworkers , that they felt he was not discussing the issues of most concern to them in his public appearances and that they wanted an opportunity to be heard mr meinhold said he hoped a description of life in patrol squadron 31 would be a counterpoint to a declaration by capt gregory a markwell , the commanding officer , which is part of the court record and widely circulated in washington this week by the navy brass captain markwell s declaration , written at the time when schedules were being rewritten to accommodate those who did not want to work with mr meinhold , said the reinstatement of the gay sailor had reduced morale , efficiency and mission focus and struck a discordant note with the troops most of the men interviewed said captain markwell , who has been unavailable for interviews , had overstated the case but none of the men were entirely free of discomfort about mr meinhold s presence and they estimated that overall sentiment in the squadron ran about 70 to 30 against welcoming gay soldiers and sailors into the military i never tried to say that a majority were for me , mr meinhold said but civil rights issues ca n't be decided by a democratic poll the two things that most bothered mr meinhold s colleagues were his love of the limelight \( he s trying to make his point at our expense , one said \) and his new habit of joining in their sexually explicit banter \( i do n't think it s even slightly amusing , one said \) both issues came up at the gripe session about two months ago , which all concerned described as useful mr meinhold said he had stopped making jokes as a result but he said he would not abandon his role as a public spokesman , even if it discomfited his colleagues because his objective was to change policy and because attention by the press was his protection against navy retribution photo keith meinhold \( associated press \)
moscow , wednesday , sept 29 president boris n yeltsin severely tightened the cordon around the headquarters of the hostile legislature tuesday , deploying hundreds of troops with concertina wire and water trucks , and even mounted police , at all approaches to the building from a yellow armored personnel carrier across the street from barricades erected by defenders of parliament , police officers with a loudspeaker demanded that those inside surrender their arms today although the gathering of forces and the demand to surrender seemed to suggest an assault on the building might be imminent , none had occurred by 8 30 am \( 1 30 am wednesday , eastern time \) the police ultimatum was not confirmed by the kremlin or the interior ministry , nor was it accompanied by the threat of any specific retaliation , suggesting that the demand might be only another twist in the weeklong war of nerves intended to pry out remaining deputies and their supporters peaceably warning about 'extremists' the buildup of force was by far the largest since mr yeltsin dissolved the obstructive legislature a week ago and called for new elections but kremlin officials maintained they had no intention of storming the parliament building , known as the white house vyacheslav kostikov , mr yeltsin s press spokesman , issued a statement saying any talk of storming the white house was misinformation from a handful of extremists who found themselves politically isolated the cordon drew crowds of angry demonstrators , and in the evening one band of several hundred protesters tried to breach the line from a side street riot police drove them back , batons swinging , but several thousand more supporters of parliament joined the fray , building barricades , hijacking two trolley buses to block traffic and pelting the police with debris and still more troops arrive the street skirmishes were over by midnight \( 5 pm tuesday , eastern time \) , but rumbling trucks and buses filled with police officers and interior ministry troops lined side streets in all directions the heaviest concentration was across from the main entrance to the united states embassy , which faces parliament witnesses said they heard bursts of gunfire about 1 am no further shots or violence followed as heavy rain changed to wet snow , the police presence diminished and those on duty eased enforcement , allowing onlookers and the press a closer look at the parliament interior ministry officials said the cordon had been tightened because there were still large stockpiles of arms in the building and because about 600 men defending parliament included some with evident psychological disorders moscow s mayor , yuri luzhkov , said there were no more than 230 deputies inside the building , of about 650 who converged there last week the deputies are holed up with several hundred hardcore communists and nationalists in an effort to put pressure on the legislators , the government has cut electricity , heat and water supplies mr yeltsin has declared that he was categorically opposed to any compromise that included early joint elections for president and parliament , a proposal that has gained considerable currency no choice is offered the tightened cordon and the police ultimatum marked a distinct intensification of the war of nerves that the president has waged against the defiant occupants of the white house though talk of compromise continued to swirl , the kremlin gave no sign it was offering anything except surrender to the deputies and their leaders the chairman , ruslan i khasbulatov , and vice president aleksandr v rutskoi , whom parliament has appointed acting president the police ultimatum early tuesday came abruptly as a large force of police officers and commandos moved in , sealing all approaches to the white house deputies , staff members and reporters were all turned back a bright yellow armored personnel carrier with a large loudspeaker was moved into position facing the white house , and at 11 am \( 4 am eastern time \) , the police advised the defenders they had 24 hours to surrender their arms the rain drenched the security forces and the protesters clusters of people gathered , including deputies demanding to be let in none were despite the blockade , mr khasbulatov gave a news conference tuesday to reporters who camped inside the white house or who managed to get in he denounced the security measures they are trying to turn us into a concentration camp , he said it is sheer fascism just a few words get out his words reached muscovites largely through cnn or western radio stations because mr yeltsin had closed the parliament s newspaper the information blockade has not been total conservative newspapers like pravda and sovetskaya rossiya have continued to publish , and other newspapers and independent news outlets have carried coverage from inside the white house but the blatantly proyeltsin television reports , with a tone reminiscent of soviet propaganda , have irritated even many of mr yeltsin s supporters

san jose , costa rica , april 29 ending a threeday standoff with armed captors , the authorities freed 18 supreme court justices and 5 others today and arrested the men who had taken them hostage several government cars pulled into the garage of the court s ninestory building here at about 3 30 pm and emerged minutes later with the hostages , all unharmed , government officials said a caravan of cars took the hostages to the ministry of public security a second caravan emerged minutes later and rushed the five gunmen to juan santamaria international airport , where they were arrested , officials said the captors had apparently believed that they were going to board a flight out of the country , and officials said later that they had promised the captors a flight to guatemala names of captors officials identified the gunmen as two brothers , guillermo and gilberto fallas their uncle , sergio elizondo , and jaime cerdas and jaime zeledon the men were held in a jail next to the court building all are costa ricans guillermo fallas is a former narcotics detective his brother had been working as a court jailer , officials said after bursting into the supreme court building and seizing the hostages on monday , the captors had initially demanded a 20 million ransom they also demanded safe passage to a south american country and the release of some prisoners from costa rican jails the ransom demand was reduced on tuesday to 8 million one magistrate , ricardo zeledon , said after his release that the abductors behaved violently at first but that none of the hostages were harmed the arrests were seen as a victory for the government , which was widely criticized last month when it allowed payment of a 250 , 000 ransom to secure the freedom of 24 hostages held for two weeks in the nicaraguan embassy a family member of one of those hostages paid the ransom to the gunmen , who were described as nicaraguans who oppose the sandinistas and the president of nicaragua , violeta barrios de chamorro the costa rican government flew the abductors out of the country after the 24 were freed today s outcome also ended without injuries to either the hostages or the captors , but the men who seized the embassy are now free although luis fishman , the minister for public security , was praised for resisting pressure to storm the embassy , he was criticized for allowing the men to leave the country at the time , he said he was fulfilling a promise costa rica had made before the international community on thursday night , however , mr fishman said his decision to free the men may have been a mistake in the case of the court takeover , mr fishman said , negotiators decided to trick the captors into giving up the hostages in exchange for a 150 , 000 ransom , which was raised by the hostages' families though president rafael angel calderon had refused to pay a ransom , he said the families were at liberty to do so after the captors released the hostages , the goverment promised to fly the five men to guatemala , mr fishman said there was one condition the men would not be allowed to enter guatemala with their weapons , he said the gunmen believed the officials , and one by one gave up their weapons , which included an ak47 , and boarded a mediumsize airplane when the fifth man gave up his weapon , officials moved in and detained the captors just one shot fired one shot was fired by a costa rican officer into the air and no one was injured , mr fishman said a caravan of police trucks brought the captors to the judicial police headquarters just before 8 pm mr fishman said officials had three options to fly the men to either guatemala or panama or to attempt to arrest them in costa rica after consulting with experts from the united states and colombia , the police decided to detain them here , he said mr fishman called the takeover an extortion attempt , but a local television station received a communique from the leader of the gunmen , guillermo fallas , who said they acted because the government had failed to respond to his pleas for a disability pension
waco , tex , march 2 years before he began ordering the branch davidians to arm themselves for the apocalypse , before he told them he was jesus christ , david koresh built up his following in a far more ordinary way by playing rock music with them , sharing an occasional beer , and , most of all , by preaching scripture with unwavering conviction even some sect members who came to conclude that he was dangerously unstable , and who managed to shake free of his cult , described him as having first lured them with his fondness for good times and a gentle promise of truth he had this amazing ability to recite verse , said robyn bunds , now 23 , who joined the sect in california and later became one of at least 19 wives of mr koresh and mother of one of his many children he just has a good way of interpreting the scriptures he is very believable after a deadly shootout with lawenforcement officials on sunday , mr koresh had still not turned himself in today as a standoff dragged on into the night at the cult s fortified compound 10 miles from here earlier in the day he had said that he and his followers would surrender if a rambling discourse on the bible was broadcast over the radio page b10 mr koresh found the people whom he ultimately brought here , and who engaged in the shootout that left four federal agents and at least two cult members dead , in california , australia and britain , and in at least three texas towns his followers were people who had lost jobs , lovers or simply a sense of belonging to the world in which they lived recruited in supermarket and though some began to question his increasingly selfcentered depictions of religious truth , many of those who remained were willing to believe that they were indeed living with the messiah and had to do whatever he said they believe so much in who they think he is that his more fanatical followers might shoot anyone who tried to stand up to vernon , said marc breault , a former member from melbourne , australia , whose trail to mr koresh s compound started when he was recruited in a supermarket in riverside , calif in calling him vernon , mr breault was referring to mr koresh s birth name , vernon wayne howell it was legally changed to david koresh in 1990 california court documents show that the cult leader requested the new name for publicity and business purposes , while mr koresh told branch davidians that he did it to reflect his conviction that he is the head of the biblical house of david koresh is a hebrew transliteration of cyrus , the name of the persian emperor who allowed the jews held captive in babylon to return to israel more recently , the 33yearold mr koresh has simply said that he is the messiah if the bible is true , then i'm christ , he said on an audio tape for his followers that was quoted in the waco tribuneherald and whose contents were also confirmed by the relative of a former cult member memorizing the bible vernon howell , born in houston in 1959 to a single mother , has a history of learning disabilities and a string of incomplete attendance records at schools in the dallas area he dropped out of high school in garland , a dallas suburb , in 1977 the only record of any extracurricular activity was one quarter in the high school band , said steve knagg , a spokesman for the garland independent school district but despite his unspectacular performance in school , the future mr koresh did exhibit one striking trait from an early age an ability to memorize passages of the bible , and to string them together to make just about any point he wished to he attended services of the seventhday adventist church and he spent a lot of time in prayer he would come home and go to the barn and pray for hours , his mother , bonnie haldeman , told the associated press on monday from her home in the east texas town of chandler neighbors said mrs haldeman left for waco this morning , and she could not be found here today sometime in the late 1970 s , mr koresh drifted to southern california by most accounts from cult members he seems to have spent most of his time proselytizing on behalf of the branch davidians , a renegade offshoot of the seventhday adventists , and demonstrating his prowess on the guitar with wavy hair , soft eyes behind wireframe glasses and a boyish grin , mr koresh also proved himself attractive to the women who congregated at a fivebedroom sect house in la verne , a community about 30 miles east of los angeles whatever his religious convictions , they did not preclude him from having sex with the women , even after he married a 14yearold girl , rachel jones , in 1984 she was the daughter of a branch davidian follower texas transformation it was not until 1986 or 1987 , when mr koresh moved with many of his followers to what had been a quiet , pastoral retreat of the branch davidians here , that mr koresh began transforming himself into a selfproclaimed messiah , former cult members said it was also in texas that he began developing the conviction that his followers should prepare for a bloody confrontation with nonbelievers that would end in his resurrection and their ticket to heaven
london , dec 28 those who know him say that when lord owen , the indefatigable mediator in the bosnian war , stepped in front of the cameras in brussels last week to announce yet another recess in the peace talks and yet another ceasefire that was being broken even as he spoke , there was a hint of frustration , even gloom , in his demeanor frankly , we 're unconvinced this ceasefire is serious , he said forlornly , ticking off the complications so far that day fighting in central bosnia , heavy shelling of sarajevo , and the hijacking of an armored personnel carrier with its crew of three british soldiers \( later released \) he appealed to the political leaders not to let this ceasefire become a joke like all the others he was asked if he might just quit after jan 15 , when the three warring factions are to reassemble in geneva , if they do not reach some kind of settlement nearly two years into their brutal conflict uncharacteristically , he brushed the question aside has it finally gotten to him , all this shuttling between geneva , zagreb , belgrade and sarajevo , this piecing together of elaborate plans and maps and obtaining agreements that seem to evaporate when the leaders submit the plans to their military commanders or their unruly legislatures \? the lies offend well , yes and again , no , he said , reached by telephone in a retreat deep in the english countryside where he spent the christmas holidays ruminating i think we are making progress it is painfully slow and demoralizing at times you fight over every village then you look back and find that the village has 150 people in it it s ridiculous he said he was also offended at the deceit from his negotiating partners i 've been struck by this feature of communist societies it does corrupt values , he said we have to face up to this lying factor they will look you straight in the face and they lie and you know it and they know you know it you just have to go on but after a few dark moments , neversaydie diplomacy is back on track and lord owen is off , talking about a final settlement , if not in january then february , and the need to get the humanitarian convoys through to the people in the mountains so they can survive the winter if you are actually pegging away at it , we have a pretty central parameter in place with the virtual agreement that the muslims will get 33 1 3 , he said , referring to percentages in a partition of bosnian territory there s an added bonus with the croat portion agreed at 175 we 've still got problems on four areas , he said , but i would say they 're solvable no thought of resigning resigning , he said , is the last thing in his mind in a funny way , the more the world wants to give up on it , the more i dig my toes in and stay with it lord owen , 55 years old and of statuesque good looks , which undoubtedly helped his career when he turned from medicine to politics , is sometimes thought of in britain as a man who divides rather than unites he had been foreign secretary in the labor government in the late 1970 s , then split the labor party in 1981 to help found the social democratic party , which he then helped to split six years later a sequence of moves that earned him the sobriquet lord owen of split but the same attributes that cut a wide swath at home and made him many enemies unbounding selfconfidence , fixity of purpose and casual abrasiveness seem to have helped him at the negotiating table in geneva and elsewhere his relationship with president slobodan milosevic of serbia , in particular , seems to be one of mutual understanding lord owen began his mediating effort on behalf of the european community in september 1992 he joined the united nationsappointed mediator , first a former united states secretary of state , cyrus r vance , then thorvald stoltenberg , a former norwegian foreign minister during that time , lord owen has seen his reputation bounce like a bungee jumper initially , the french were wary because he had advocated direct military action against the serbs , but he was able to assuage their doubts , pledging himself a servant to the policy of the whole european community then last spring his attempts to coerce the serbs , croats and muslims into accord over the complicated vanceowen plan , which would have divided bosniaherzegovina into 10 ethnic cantons , brought him into disrepute with some , mostly those who thought that by taking into account serbian gains on the ground his scheme rewarded serbian aggression he tried to sell it in washington , calling it , with characteristic chutzpah , the only game in town but without support from the united states and opposed by the bosnian serbs , it collapsed within days , lord owen was trying to sketch a new plan , this one based on ideas advanced by serbs and croats a slice of realpolitik that brought more condemnation from those favoring a harder line toward the serbs it reached an apogee when an american columnist , jim hoagland of the washington post , compared lord owen to neville chamberlain , saying he would be the person we remember whenever the west s betrayal of bosnia is mentioned in the future even though many others deserve that honor as well
manhasset , li , dec 18 five months ago , a study by the brookhaven national laboratory found that emergency workers' response to the 1990 crash of an avianca airliner that killed 73 people was poorly organized , and that delays in treatment may have raised the death toll 20 percent but on dec 7 , when 23 people were shot on a long island rail road train , things were different , county officials and hospital administrators said this week the response was second to none , said chief peter w meade , nassau county s fire and rescue coordinator the docs in the hospital emergency departments got it right the communicators in medical control got it right the folks in fire and rescue communications got it right fiftyfive minutes elapsed from the time help arrived on the scene of the shooting to the time the last injured person entered a hospital emergency room by constrast , most of those injured in the avianca crash arrived at hospitals two to six hours after the incident 'disciplined response' the biggest thing that worked in our favor last week was a disciplined response , chief meade said on thursday folks whose services were not needed were asked to remain on standby in their quarters this facilitated a less congested response to the area it was easier to discern which units had patients ready for treatment and to assign hospitals in the avianca crash , the brookhaven study found , delays were partly the result of vehicles clogging the few narrow roadways leading to the hillside in cove neck , li , where the jet crashed after running out of fuel things ran a lot smoother this time , said dr joseph greensher , chairman of the nassau county emergency medical services committee , an oversight panel the end results you know six people died and 19 were wounded in the shooting and the ensuing scramble to get off the train officials said that those who survived were quickly transported to the hospitals best able to meet their needs dr greensher , medical director of winthropuniversity hospital in mineola , said we did n't have to transfer any patients to other hospitals like we did during avianca they all ended up in the appropriate place he credited good communication between the scene of the shooting and the hospitals for the outcome practice pays off inspector gary ruff , the commanding officer of the county s emergency ambulance bureau , said , the secret to our ability to respond like we did was practice after the avianca crash , inspector ruff said , a disaster procedure was generally initiated whenever more than three people were injured in an accident since this happens at least three times a week , on average , it enables all those involved in the county s rescue efforts to be trained , he said , so it becomes like second nature dr joan mcinerney , chairwoman of the emergency medicine department at the nassau county medical center in east meadow , said , one of the things we learned early on during avianca was that if we knew we were going to get a lot of patients we should be ready to assign a team to each bay as each patient came in they were assigned a fresh team of doctors and staff who were really there just for them at winthrop , dr gerald brody , the head of ambulatory care , said what we learned from avianca was that we had the need to manage our hospital staff better as our employees heard about the crash they descended on the emergency room we had so many people it was actually tough to manage one of the things we learned was that we had to divide up where people went somewhat , and we had to learn to say to people , 'we do n't need you now' easier the second time before the avianca crash , he said , he had never managed a disaster before , and he had to learn the decisionmaking process by the time i went through it a second time , he said , the decisions were much easier patrick coonan , assistant director of emergency nursing services , at north shore university hospital here , said officials also learned after the avianca crash about the need for employees to have an outlet to talk about the incident it could have been anyone s relative in that situation on the train , he said it helps the staff to talk openly about it if we put those issues on the table , it make it a lot easier for everybody besides learning to care more expeditiously for the wounded , dr brody said that after the avianca incident , i think that we got a better sense , a more visceral sense , of the need for families to have information helping reunions barbara kohart , vice president of administration at winthrop , said that by 7 o'clock on the night of the shooting they had close to 200 people in their lobby looking for loved ones ms kohart said she worked the lobby with social workers that night , pooling information with other hospitals about their incoming wounded by the end of the night , families were reunited across the county by the concerted efforts that each hospital made families were also allowed to see their relatives as quickly as possible there s a lot of people i'm going to remember from that night , she said , including families looking for their loved ones who almost became victims
washington , nov 13 following are excerpts from remarks today by president clinton at the 86th convocation of the church of god in christ , held in memphis , as transcribed by the federal information systems corporation , a private transcription service i guess what i really want to say to you today , my fellow americans , is that we can do all of this and still fail unless we meet the great crisis of the spirit that is gripping america today when i leave you , congressman ford and i are going to a baptist church near here to a town meeting he s having on health care and violence i tell you , unless we do something about crime and violence and drugs that is ravaging the community , we will not be able to repair this country if martin luther king , who said , like moses , i am on the mountaintop and i can see the promised land , but i'm not going to be able to get there with you but we will get there if he were reappear by my side today and give us a report card on the last 25 years , what would he say \? you did a good job , he would say voting and electing people who formerly were not electable because of the color of their skin you have more political power and that is good you did a good job , he would say , letting people who have the ability to do so , live wherever they want to live , go wherever they want to go in this great country you did a good job , he would say , elevating people of color into the ranks of the united states armed forces to the very top or into the very top of our government you did a very good job , he would say he would say , did a good job creating a black middle class of people who really are doing well , and the middle class is growing more among african americans than among nonafrican americans you did a good job you did a good job in opening opportunity but he would say , i did not live and die to see the american family destroyed i did not live and die to see 13yearold boys get automatic weapons and gun down 9yearolds just for the kick of it i did not live and die to see young people destroy their own lives with drugs and then build fortunes destroying the lives of others that is not what i came here to do i fought for freedom , he would say , but not for the freedom of people to kill each other with reckless abandonment , not for the freedom of children to have children and the fathers of the children to walk away from them and abandon them , as if they do n't amount to anything i fought for people to have the right to work , but not to have whole communities and people abandoned this is not what i lived and died for , my fellow americans , he would say i fought to stop white people from being so filled with hate that they would wreak violence on black people i did not fight for the right of black people to murder other black people with reckless abandonment death on a dare the other day , the mayor of baltimore , a dear friend of mine , told me a story of visiting the family of a young man who had been killed 18 years old on halloween he always went out with littlebitty kids so they could trick or treat safely and across the street from where they were walking on halloween , a 14yearold boy gave a 13yearold boy a gun and dared him to shoot the 18yearold boy and he shot him dead and the mayor had to visit the family in washington , dc , where i live your nation s capital , the symbol of freedom throughout the world look how that freedom is being exercised the other night , a man came along the street and grabbed a 1yearold child and put the child in his car the child may have been the child of the man and two people were after him and they chased him in the car and they just kept shooting with reckless abandonment , knowing that baby was in the car and they shot the man dead , and a bullet went through his body into the baby s body and blew the little bootee off the child s foot the other day on the front page of our paper , the nation s capital are we talking about world peace or world conflict \? you know , a big article on the front page of the washington post about an 11yearold child planning her funeral these are the hymns i want sung this is the dress i want to wear i know i'm not going to live very long that is not the freedom the freedom to die before you 're a teenager is not what martin luther king lived and died for more than 37 , 000 people die from gunshot wounds in this country every year gunfire is the leading cause of death in young men and now that we 've all gotten so cool that everybody can get a semiautomatic weapon , a person shot now is three times more likely to die than 15 years ago , because they 're likely to have three bullets in them a hundredandsixtythousand children stay home from school every day because they are scared they will be hurt in their school the other day , i was in california at a town meeting , and a handsome young man stood up and said , mr president , my brother and i , we do n't belong to gangs we do n't have guns we do n't do drugs we want to go to school we want to be professionals we want to work hard we want to do well we want to have families and we changed our school , because the school we were in was so dangerous so , when we showed up to the new school to register , my brother and i were standing in line , and somebody ran in the school and started shooting a gun , and my brother was shot down standing right in front of me at the safer school
washington , feb 11 an infuriated federal district court judge today strongly criticized a new york state trial judge and set a june 1 trial date for clark m clifford , the onetime counselor to several democratic presidents , and his law partner , robert a altman , on bank fraud charges at a hearing today , judge joyce hens green criticized the lawyers for mr clifford and mr altman , the federal prosecutors , the manhattan district attorney s office and the new york state trial judge , john a k bradley she made it clear she felt they had all misled her and were toying with her authority mr altman and mr clifford , a former defense secretary , were charged last summer in federal and state indictments in washington and new york both indictments charged that the two men had deceived bank regulators about their knowledge of how first american bankshares inc of washington was secretly owned by the bank of credit and commerce international , a bank , now defunct , that had been involved in a variety of crimes since the indictments , lawyers in new york and washington have engaged in an elaborate and confusing legal tugofwar judge green was angered because she had agreed in september to allow the new york trial to proceed first , on what she said were judge bradley s ironclad assurances that the proceedings would begin no later than jan 4 she said that she learned only from the newspapers that the trial had been first delayed to feb 15 , and that she learned only today that it had been postponed further to march 15 she complained that none of the lawyers involved , nor judge bradley , had told her judge bradley did not return a telephone call to his chambers today seeking comment in any event , no one expects mr clifford , 86 and ailing , to stand trial in either place in the near future , if ever mr clifford s lawyers said he was scheduled to undergo a heart bypass operation in march , and he will ask to have both trials postponed prosecutors will then go forward with the case against mr altman , his 45yearold protege
to preservationists , the history of the city s landmarks law is littered with the ruins of the architectural and historical treasures of queens even as the law has protected hundreds of historic buildings in manhattan and brooklyn , preservationists in queens have watched with dismay as many of their most cherished landmarks have fallen jacob riis s stately 19thcentury home in richmond hill , the bodine castle overlooking the east river in long island city and the loew s triboro theater in astoria , one of the grand palaces of the golden age of movies nearly three decades after new york city enacted the nation s strictest landmarks preservation law , queens has the fewest landmarks of any borough the scarcity reflects a deep distrust that many in queens feel toward any meddling by manhattan bureaucrats , as well as what some have seen as antiborough snobbery in the preservation community but it also stems from the legacy of one man , donald r manes , the former borough president , who wielded his power to block many landmarks in the 1970 s and 1980 s in recent years , however , as the pressures of development have increased , especially with the influx of immigrants , and as the leadership of the city s landmarks preservation commission has changed , a nascent preservation movement has gained momentum and political support in its effort to preserve the historic buildings and neighborhoods that have shaped the identity of queens now , after years of hostility and frustration , of resistance and political machinations , the commission is weighing an issue that preservationists see as a test of the city s and the borough s readiness to accept landmarks in queens whether to designate as a historic district the elegant early20th century buildings in jackson heights that gave garden apartments their name queens is an anomaly , said jeffrey a kroessler , president of the queensborough preservation league when i look at manhattan and brooklyn and all the landmarks they have , at the pride they have , i just do n't know there has n't been the political support it s so unnecessary , because there are so many great buildings and so many historic districts in queens the city s landmark law , which restricts the demolition or exterior alteration of designated buildings , has always provoked strong reactions , pitting the desire to preserve the city s rich history against the rights of homeowners and developers in the 28 years since the law took effect , the city s landmarks commission has designated 931 landmarks and 58 historic districts , the vast majority in manhattan 625 landmarks and 36 districts brooklyn has 127 landmarks and 15 districts the bronx has 57 landmarks and 5 districts staten island , 86 landmarks and 1 district in queens , first settled by the dutch in the 1600 s but largely developed in this century , there are only 36 landmarks and one district , a small block of 19thcentury row houses in hunters point there has n't been a strong preservation ethic , so there s not very much designated , said laurie beckleman , chairwoman of the landmarks preservation commission , who has promised to consider areas she acknowledges lack their share of landmarks not only queens , but also the bronx and staten island i blame it on a few people who held the power and said , 'this is my town and you 're not going to tell me what to do ! ' no one reflected that sentiment more than mr manes with his vote and power on the board of estimate , mr manes often vehemently opposed landmark status , including during the bitter , unsuccessful effort over the last historic district proposed in queens , the row houses in steinway from 1973 to 1989 , the board , which gave final approval to landmarks until the city council assumed that role in 1990 , rejected or modified 19 sites designated by the commission nine were in queens reputation for hostility frances a eberhart , the executive director of the historic districts council , said that the borough s reputation for hostility to landmarks became such that the commission and preservationists simply gave up , not even proposing other buildings or districts the powers at be did n't want them , she said , and the landmarks commission looked elsewhere the city council speaker , peter f vallone , said mr manes simply reflected the views of constituents , especially developers and middleclass homeowners , who feared the legal restrictions and rejected the value of landmark status he was typical of most in queens , mr vallone said he viewed it as another intrusion from manhattan to the outer boroughs short shrift while queens lacks manhattan s concentration of historic sites , it does not lack architecturally significant buildings and districts but preservationists say the borough has not received the attention it deserves the landmarks commission is after all located at city hall and it tends to have the vision of city hall , said barry w lewis , an architectural historian from kew gardens they have to see brownstones if they do n't see brownstones , they do n't think it has anything to do with new york city preservationists say that neglect has marred some of the borough s most distinguished neighborhoods , in which valuable buildings have been altered or demolished
the bronx in his shock of the new , a history of modernism , robert hughes takes note of those who , he says , lent the russian revolution its esthetic voice he lists writers like vladimir mayakovsky , artists like alexander rodchenko and vladimir tatlin and film makers on the order of eisenstein , adding that , together , they created an art of expectation all the same , their s was a future that never came and by contemporary standards , it was a very modest future no mass communications to speak of and no money nevertheless , its spirit lingers and may be clearly sensed in mayakovsky man or myth at the lehman college art gallery here this exhibition , one of two attractions at the gallery , is of memorabilia assembled by the walker , ursitti and mcginnis gallery in manhattan it marks the anniversary of mayakovsky s birth in 1893 , as did the recent conference at the college it also draws attention to patricia thompson , a teacher at lehman , who was born of the poet s liaison with a russian emigree , elly jones , during his visit to new york city in 1925 the show includes a cubistic drawing of jones done the same year by david burliuk , a futuristturnedblaue reiter painter who settled in the united states otherwise , the images are mostly blackandwhite photographs from the 20 s and from 1990 to '91 many of the recent ones have been tinted in bright colors there are also several posters and magazine cover designs the most impressive print in the collection , however , is the wellknown monochrome of mayakovsky taken by rodchenko and blown up life size were it not for his threepiece suit complete with watch fob and boots polished to a military shine , the subject could pass for a skinhead but with or without hair and no matter what he wore , this was a handsome man and something of a dandy another memorable black and white is that of the critic osip brik , bespectacled and also with a shaved head the image was used to advertise lef , a literary magazine founded by rodchenko and mayakovsky in 1923 , the logo of which is inserted into one of the sitter s lenses the triangle of mayakovsky , brik , who served as his editor , and brik s wife , lilya , who became the poet s mistress , was comparable to any in the bloomsbury set , which was flourishing at about the same time among intimate items on view is a cartoon by mayakovsky of his new york mistress , elly jones , literally looking daggers at him still , the meat of the exhibition is the small advertisements for statemanufactured galoshes and watches these produced by rodchenko and mayakovsky and for some reason reproduced as painted photographs in mr hughes s words , that two such men , leaders in their respective arts , could work together on advertisements of state products at a time when t s eliot was agonizing over having to work in a bank , says much about the constructivist spirit but then again , as mr hughes points out , the aim was to develop fully every way of addressing one s fellows , not to scramble for places on the hierarchical ladder of the arts the golden age was over by the mid20 s , and mayakovsky died , a suicide , in 1930 there is a picture of his daughter taken in the moscow apartment where he shot himself , playing russian roulette although never his supporter in life , stalin proclaimed him after his death the poet of the revolution in the opinion of a russian critic and contemporary of mayakovsky , d s minsky , the poetry of this aristocratic georgian is very loud , very unrefined and stands absolutely outside the distinction between 'good' and 'bad' taste today , communism seems no longer a force to be reckoned with but rather something that the world is trying to recover from in this exhibition , however , it is a relic as romantic as a flower pressed between the pages of a book the exhibition is on view through may 21 the other lehman show is friends and neighbors the art of john ahearn and rigoberto torres this partnership dates back to 1979 , when mr ahearn moved from manhattan to the bronx and met mr torres at the alternative space , fashion moda mr ahearn had already begun making painted life casts of his neighbors mr torres was working at various jobs including that of painting the religious statuary made at his uncle s factory the two moved onto the same block and began to collaborate , producing the colored busts that have since become familiar gallery fare in both the bronx and manhattan then , along came the city s department of cultural affairs and its percent for art program , and mr ahearn was commissioned to produce bronzes for a park opposite the 44th precinct police station there were problems from the beginning , like the department s inexplicable failure to include mr torres in their contract but more serious was the setback that followed the arrival of the bronzes in the park and led to their removal within a few days as told by jane kramer in the dec 21 issue of the new yorker , this is a long and nuancefilled story that defies summary except to say that the main problem was one of political correctness apparently , there were too many bronx citizens who took exception to the unavoidable realism in mr ahearn s work for example , the figure of raymond in a hooded sweatshirt crouching beside his pit bull , toby it would seem that where art is concerned , a poor community , no matter how beleaguered , insists on the same idealization that is routinely visited on richer , happier communities along with other bronx bronzes raymond and toby is at lehman for all to appreciate because the artists take their casts from life a blackandwhite photograph shows them doing the photographer andres serrano the results can scarcely be less than accurate a particularly lifelike example features little girls skipping rope this is double dutch at kelly street , a fiberglass relief on the side of a building that is part of homage to the people of the bronx \( in order to be cast , the subjects had to assume their positions lying down \) but samson , the little boy with a mop of dreadlocks who wears orange shorts and straddles the gap between two breeze blocks , may well be more glamorous in painted plaster than he is in real life in any event , the reviewer sides with those observers \( none of them trained in the subject \) who have likened these images to ones ornamenting gothic cathedrals friends and neighbors is a good show that is also fun it remains on view through june 3 the number to call for more information is \( 718 \) 9608732 photos vladimir mayakovsky by alexander rodchenko titi in window , left , and double dutch at kelly street , both by john ahearn
tunkashila from the birth of turtle island to the blood of wounded knee by gerald hausman illustrated 265 pp new york st martin s press 2295 once upon a time , according to a native american legend , our continent was a tiny dab of mud on the back of a great turtle how it became the home to mountains and rivers , animals and people , is the subject of gerald hausman s collection of tales that he calls tunkashila a word that means grandfather in lakota all the creations of nature , the author tells us , have divine antecedents , whose spirits will still guide us if we only know how to listen mr hausman , who has written a dozen books \( including the sun horse and turtle island alphabet \) on indian culture , collected these tales over the past several decades from native american friends of many tribes \( he himself is part iroquois \) and from the notebooks of his mother , who was a student of anthropology in the 1930 s one quality that differentiates tunkashila from the many other compilations of indian lore in print is the arrangement of tales in sequence , from the earliest eons of the cosmos to recent times hundreds of tribal myths , mr hausman explains , are woven together , along with characters who are common to all tribes the trickster , the chief , the warrior , the shaman and the lover the interconnectedness of its stories allows the book to be read like a novel , a narrative about the history of the earth viewed from a nonwestern , phantasmagorical perspective the deities that preceded the first people were aweinspiring but by no means perfect they had to learn much of their wisdom while combating the chaotic forces that roamed the newly fashioned earth the sun father contended with creatures like water monster , a witch , a slick and sodden hag whose skin was welloiled with slime , and cactus giant , who had hair of manyneedled nastiness and eyes that had no pupils only white orbs buried in fatty layers of dark green corpselike skin the gods and goddesses , like those of many mythologies , were a lusty race sun father s decision to people the earth arose when he first saw earth mother leaning over naked to wash her hair in the ocean throwing a blue blanket on his turquoise horse , he rode down out of the clouds , with a sunbeam for a bridle and a rainbow for reins and had his way with her in a rollicking , erotic tussle that shook the universe for a time after their creation , people and animals lived together as one race , undifferentiated and interdependent in one story , a spotted frog warns listener , an indian version of noah , to build a raft in order to rescue his people from a great flood the hero is then helped by a mosquito that changes into a beautiful woman who becomes his wife in another tale , a boy climbs a sacred mountain peak to steal a baby eagle from its nest its mother flings him into the abyss below , but when his brother returns the eaglet to its parents , they reward him with a glorious vision of the sky kingdom and the knowledge of medicinal herbs to give to his people a character named bear guardian marries a man and gives birth to an owl that , trying to mingle with humans , is humiliated at a dance and takes revenge by eating one of the human babies thus begins the era when people and animals are first separated , and with it the legend that the owl is the harbinger of doom as people evolved , the earth enjoyed periods of harmony , when the stories of their grandfathers guided them , and periods of warfare , from which very different tales of adventure , cruelty and heroism resulted stories were told to describe the coming of the foreigners in one , virginia dare , the first child of english parents born on the continent , turns into a magical white doe that can be killed only with a silver arrowhead the last war between the invaders and the people of turtle island ended at wounded knee , sd in 1890 afterwards , tales of military heroism became mere memories no two stories in this book are alike , though some characters like the marvelous trickster figure , shapeshifter appear several times gerald hausman s writing is richly lyrical his language creates a swirling , lustrous world in which his characters come triumphantly to life occasionally , however , he attempts to illuminate the meanings of the stories in the same lyrical style with which he tells them this results in some vague , unsatisfying explanations he provides a glossary of key characters , but one wishes he had included more information about the people whose stories he has told none of these problems take away from the pleasure of reading the tales themselves gerald hausman s tunkashila is an eloquent tribute to the first great storytellers of america now that s a temper ! it was i , first man , whom shapeshifter resented the most , for i was the leader of the people , the one they looked up to from the first , i saw his shifting ways , his need to alter his presence you may ask what he looked like , and i would be hard pressed to tell , for he changed shape as often as the air changes direction one time he looked like wolf , the wanderer another time he assumed the shape of hawk , the wind walker often enough , i saw nothing of him , for he passed like smoke once i saw him come out of the pinewood , cross before our camp , where someone , an ant person , spoke roughly to him there were many ant people sitting around the fire for warmth red , yellow , brown and black ant people and he fell upon them in a reckless fury , rending heads from necks , shearing throats , cracking skulls , snapping limbs , scattering them like broken sticks and when i called to him , all i saw were his pointed ears vanishing in the night he had a temper , that one you may ask why i since i was the one responsible did not capture and banish him yet i ask you this how might you banish a shadow , a bit of fluff , a pinch of dust \? from tunkashila
hartford , feb 10 connecticut s struggles to heal its economy and stop the loss of jobs caused by military cutbacks have not turned the tide economists say that while the end of the recession may yet lift the state s other industries , like insurance , banking and real estate , military contractors are unlikely ever again to require the number of workers they needed even five years ago the implications of that fact resonate through just about every aspect of life in the state along with aid , more setbacks if you took connecticut s difficulties and blew them up to the national level , you 'd have social revolt in the streets , said edward j deak , a professor of economics at fairfield university government has not given up gov lowell p weicker jr , for example , has begun one of the boldest efforts in the nation to help industry , including direct investments of state money to help military contractors develop new products and the state s congressional delegation is fighting on several fronts to win president clinton s help , both in preserving weapons programs and in financing conversion efforts continuing layoffs yet every day , it seems , there are more layoffs just last month , pratt whitney , the jetengine maker , said it would dismiss a third of its connecticut work force of 20 , 000 over the next two years pratt whitney had successfully cut its dependence on military sales to 30 percent of its overall sales , relying instead on a bustling commercial business until those orders fell off abruptly because of the airlines' continuing troubles staggering , but coping it s almost like a boxer receiving two body blows , said paul getman , managing director of regional financial associates , an economic research firm just like pratt whitney , he said , the whole connecticut economy has been hit from two sides by military cutbacks and the recession they can survive one , but surviving two is very tough that s what they 've got , two very severe body blows the challenge using old skills for new demands unlike the situation in some states with big air force or navy bases , a high proportion of connecticut s military workers hold manufacturing jobs skilled , hightechnology manufacturing jobs making products for aerospace and undersea warfare that group of skills is the state s great hope if it is lost , economic development officials say , a whole segment of connecticut s future could slip away with it connecticut gave the world the colt peacemaker , known as the gun that won the west , and the nautilus , the world s first nuclear submarine connecticut supplied cannons to george washington , trench mortars to the doughboys of world war i , and m16 rifles to the troops in vietnam tank engines built in connecticut drove the mechanized forces of the united states in the war in the persian gulf now the race is on to save what can be saved from the state legislature , to the local communities that have banded in new alliances , to business executives and workers in plants across the state , the sense of urgency has ignited public debate about where connecticut goes from here there are signals of change , if not outright hope these people are new englanders , they understand change , they live with the seasons , said john c markowicz , president of sonalysts inc , a diversified military contractor in waterford people here still believe if you put your shoulder to the wheel , good things will come state as venture capitalist the state department of economic development has received national attention for doing what in most states , and certainly in the federal government , would be considered taboo investing taxpayer dollars directly in companies that the state believes are growing in the right direction although only 9 million has been invested so far in three companies , the underlying ideas , and the risks , are large indeed just like venture capitalists on wall street , the state could make a handsome return on its investments , or lose everything it s industrial policy , said the state s commissioner of economic development , joseph g mcgee we 're trying to use these years to change public perception we 're saying that this will take a sustained commitment of connecticut tax dollars in order to create an alternative industrial base as long as we have winner investments , it s a home run , he said as soon as we blow 5 million on a deal that goes bad , all hell s going to break loose the state s first direct investments began early last year , with a 3 million infusion of tax money in textron lycoming , a military tankengine maker that was seeking a commercial jet engine contract then pratt whitney received 3 million to help reengineer its aircraft jet engines as gas turbine generators to produce electricity the kaman corporation , a helicopter parts maker just outside hartford , got 3 million to help it market a new commercial heavypayload helicopter a daunting crusade the state has also issued more than 200 million in loans , loan guarantees , and outright grants to manufacturers that might otherwise have left the state but time and time again , small steps forward have been overshadowed by walloping layoffs and plant closings even governor weicker s boundless optimism has seemed to flag
charlotte , nc when hugh l mccoll jr decided to build a new headquarters here for his company , the nationsbank corporation , he wanted not merely an office building , but a skyscraper so he hired the architect of the world financial center in new york and commissioned a 60story , crowntopped tower soaring above anything else within hundreds of miles like a pin stuck in a map , the building , completed last year , seems to assert that nationsbank is as important a financial player as any in new york a pretentious notion \? maybe once , but no longer since taking over a mediumsized north carolina bank in 1983 , mr mccoll has built through a series of bold acquisitions a banking behemoth with 2 , 000 branches from texas to maryland the company is closing in on chemical banking to become the country s thirdlargest bank by total assets , behind only citicorp and bankamerica now , nationsbank is increasingly challenging the biggest banks and wall street traders and investment bankers for the business of the country s largest corporations and sometimes , it is winning if mr mccoll succeeds , he may have erected in charlotte the sort of financial powerhouse that the new york banks have dreamed of becoming banks like citicorp have long hoped to offer all manner of financial services , from a child s savings account to a corporation s stock offering yet the risks are as big as his ambition none of these banks have proven that they can simultaneously serve both individuals and big corporations without running into trouble in one of the two areas indeed , several other regional banks , like banc one , have grown through interstate mergers to have the size and strength to compete with the big banks and brokerage firms but they have avoided that market and chosen to serve only individuals and small to mediumsized businesses , markets that are seen as more lucrative than the shrinking and competitive world of corporate lending lemons or lemonade while the omnivorous mr mccoll aims to compete for individual and smallbusiness customers too , he has long had a fondness for corporate banking , a business he ran at nationsbank s predecessor , ncnb that bank , along with two big ones it acquired , first republicbank in texas and cs sovran in atlanta , was predominantly a corporate lender we found ourselves with a huge franchise of corporate customers , said the 58yearold former marine who could safely be called america s most ambitious banker we had to decide whether to abandon this market or try to make lemonade out of what people call a lemon over the last two years , nationsbank has made lemonade by the bucket , winning business from corporations by offering attractive rates and terms , while many giant banks were preoccupied with nursing their ailing real estate portfolios this year it ranks third in loans to big companies , after chemical and citicorp and above bankamerica , chase manhattan and j p morgan in search of the corporate customer , mr mccoll is also moving beyond banking into the treacherous terrain of wall street some aspects of our company will look more like goldman sachs than the old ncnb , he said nationsbank has applied for government permission to underwrite securities , a business that has perplexed most of the largest banks an in an even bolder strike , nationsbank just spent 225 million to buy chicago research and trading , a private partnership specializing in using computer models to trade options and other complex financial instruments known as derivatives over all , nationsbank s institutional business , which includes corporate banking and trading and investmentbanking operations , accounted for a fifth of the company s 115 billion in profits last year that portion is bigger this year , mr mccoll said , and it represents the bank s fastestgrowing and most profitable major business line despite the profits today , the risks of mr mccoll s strategy are huge in the past , the banks that have been most aggressive in corporate lending , such as continental illinois , have often had the biggest loan losses later nationsbank is going all over the country winning business by underpricing the market , said the head of corporate lending at a large new york bank history shows that when you do that , you eventually get your clock cleaned mr mccoll argues that nationsbank is protected by its vast branch network , which gives it a huge base of deposits and a diversified loan portfolio banks have run into trouble , in his view , when they do not have a stable source of funds and when they concentrate their loans in one industry 'charge ! ' when it was a onebranch bank in charlotte in the 1950 s , nationsbank s predecessor lent only to other banks , businesses and the wealthy the consumer side of nationsbank s business is really only 10 years old , begun when the company made its first outofstate acquisition , in 1982 the corporate business was enhanced through the two big acquisitions in 1988 ncnb bought first republicbank , which when it failed was the largest bank in texas , with many relationships with large companies , especially in the energy industry in 1991 ncnb bought the cs sovran corporation of atlanta , which had a lot of corporate customers
dozens of representatives of the nation s largest propertycasualty insurance companies began gathering claims from owners of firedamaged homes around southern california yesterday , after a series of fires caused what is estimated to be more than 250 million in insured losses state farm and allstate , the two insurance companies expected to receive the largest share of the claims , both said yesterday that it was too early to gauge the final insurance toll of a series of fires that whipped across 152 , 000 acres and destroyed more than 720 structures the insured losses are expected to be considerably less than those from the fire that swept through the hills of oakland , calif , in 1991 , which resulted in more than 1 billion in claims none of the large companies are going to be seriously threatened by the events this year , said jack snyder , a vice president and insurance analyst at a m best , an insurance rating service in oldwick , nj they have all had relatively strong earnings for the past nine months but they are n't getting the relief they were looking for , particularly after the losses from hurricane andrew in 1992 but the fires in laguna beach , anaheim hills , altadena and other parts of southern california came during a year when the property casualty industry has already suffered more than 5 billion in losses this year has been costly because of events ranging from the blizzard that struck the east coast , to the world trade center bombing , to unusually severe tornado and hail storms the industry , with 160 billion in capital , suffered 22 billion in losses last year , the highest in its history state farm and allstate , along with the farmers' insurance company , one of the largest insurers of cars and homes on the west coast , account for more than half of homeowners insurance policies sold in southern california , according to steven goldstein , a spokesman for the insurance information institute , an industry trade group he said that insurers arrived quickly , with federal disaster officials , to help set up disaster relief stations and process claims that was in contrast to the insurers' response to the fire in the oakland hills , which outraged residents and a number of political leaders who have accused insurers of refusing to pay claims quickly 'under a microscope' we are aware that our industry is under a microscope , mr goldstein said we have had several major policyholder meetings we have been much more aggressive this time in getting the message out an allstate spokeswoman , kathleen hogan , said her company had 20 representatives in the field and that so far they had received 200 claims from homeowners allstate has about 17 percent of the homeowners insurance market in the area state farm , which holds about 22 percent of the homeowners policies there , has received 588 claims , including 129 from homeowners whose houses were total losses , jerry parsons , a company spokesman , said one concern for several insurers , mr goldstein said , was whether they would collect payments from reinsurance companies for damage from the fires reinsurance is a type of policy bought by insurance companies , so that in cases of large losses they can spread some cost to others reinsurance is paid only when the losses from an event are more than a certain dollar amount the question , mr goldstein said , is whether reinsurers will treat the fires in southern california as one very expensive event or as several smaller separate events that might not qualify for payment under reinsurance agreements
atlanta , aug 31 the san diego padres' frenzied fire sale continued to fuel the atlanta braves' drive toward a third consecutive division championship tonight it s too early to proclaim the secondplace braves the winners , but the trend is clear david justice , whose bat and mind were unshackled by the arrival of fred mcgriff six weeks ago , drove in four runs with a single to left field and a home run to right field as the blossoming braves battered the sagging san francisco giants , 82 , tonight barry bonds , whose lateyear failures against atlanta pitchers have become infamous , tried to stir the giants , but his 39th home run and three singles in four times at bat fell short of the braves' latest onslaught against san francisco pitching the victory , the braves' fourth in a row against the giants in nine days , slashed the giants' national league west lead to three and a half games , the smallest firstplace margin san francisco has had over any team since june 8 , a span of nearly half a season 'we 're still chasing them' you ca n't write the giants off , justice said we have n't caught them yet they still have the lead we 're still chasing them the teams play two more games in this series , then see each other no more , a circumstance that delights the giants they certainly have seen enough of greg maddux , one of atlanta s awesome foursome just as he did last wednesday in san francisco , maddux \( 169 \) stifled the giants , pitching a sixhitter and giving him a twogame report card of three runs allowed in 17 innings and just like last wednesday , the braves battered bill swift , one of the giants' two successful but slumping starters the braves shelled swift , a 17game winner , for five runs in the fourth inning , the first two on justice s basesloaded single , then drove him from the game in the fifth in his two starts against atlanta , swift gave up 13 runs \( 11 earned \) in 9 innings , failing to survive the fifth inning each time justice devastated swift last week , too , teaming with mcgriff on a pair of consecutive home runs before tonight s game , mcgriff made light of the significance of his arrival in the braves' lineup july 20 , replying not much when he was asked how responsible he was for the braves' present position but bobby cox , the braves' manager , could n't have disagreed more strongly i think he has everything to do with it , cox said it took a lot of the pressure off the other guys they were trying to win each game with one swing when he came , they relaxed it s a huge difference with him in the lineup both hitting and psychological exhibit a bm \( before mcgriff \) , justice hit 21 home runs and drove in 61 runs in 90 games am \( after mcgriff \) , justice has slugged 14 home runs , including 6 in the last 6 games , and knocked in 35 runs in 37 games exhibit b bm , the braves had a 5341 record and were 9 games behind the giants am , they have a 299 record and are closing fast mcgriff has batted 318 , hit 13 home runs and driven in 30 runs in 38 games with atlanta justice confirmed mcgriff s role in his upgraded production what it did for myself was it allowed me to take a little bit of pressure off myself , the right fielder said of mcgriff s arrival i do n't feel i have to drive in all the runs none of the braves had a run or a hit in the first three innings tonight but with one out in the fourth , after bonds hit a home run in the top of the inning for a 10 lead , jeff blauser grounded a single to right field ron gant followed with an infield single , and swift walked mcgriff on four pitches , loading the bases swift made his next pitch too good , and justice , a lefthanded hitter , lined it to left for a single and a 21 lead he had just walked freddie on four pitches , justice said i was looking for a strike on the first pitch and i just wanted to get a good swing at it swift struck out terry pendleton for the second out , but he threw three balls to damon berryhill , and berryhill lined the next pitch to right field for a runscoring single we swing at some 30 pitches , cox said there s no reason not to in certain situations berryhill is down near the bottom of the order you 're not going to get many good pitches to hit there other than 30 mark lemke did n't wait for 30 he lashed a 10 pitch for a double to leftcenter for two more runs an error by robby thompson led to swift s departure in the fifth with two out , blauser , who had reached first on the miscue , scored as mcgriff rapped a double to rightcenter dave righetti replaced swift and brushed justice back with his second pitch , but justice hit his fourth pitch , on a 30 count , over the rightfield fence the home run was the sixth righetti had given up in five and onethird innings i do n't think he was throwing at me , justice said it probably just got away from him as for swinging at another 30 pitch , justice said i have n't been given the sign not to swing all season i was

altadena , calif , oct 28 in this community where the sprawl of los angeles meets the scrubland of the san gabriel mountains , exhausted firefighters have been battling what experts call the fire of the future employing air assaults and prison crews on the ground to clear away brush , firefighters have struggled for the last two days to outrace hungry wildfires and outwit the changeable santa ana winds while setting up a fire line to protect vulnerable homes at the city s fringes they have had to combine rural and urban firefighting techniques to make frontal attacks on fastmoving and unpredictable brush fires , which , if they had been in uninhabited scrublands , would be allowed to burn free within a perimeter of fire breaks this strategy is more and more common as more and more of california s homes have spread into canyons and up hillsides hot tub can save a house what we are seeing right now is what we have termed the fire of the future , with wildfires destroying large numbers of structures , said karen terrill , a spokeswoman for the state department of forestry and fire protection this is what we are going to see more and more frequently in places like altadena , firefighters have also learned to make their stands where houses are defensible and abandon those that are closely surrounded by brush or trees the most defensible houses , ms terrill said , are those with open space around them , with fireretardant roofs or with swimming pools to provide water hot tubs have been known to save houses , she said the altadena fire , which still raged today on the hillsides but no longer threatened houses , has been an example of this new complex challenge , said clark pearson , an inspector with the los angeles county fire department on wednesday , fire destroyed or damaged 115 homes and forced the evacuation of 500 others the blaze injured 29 firefighters and caused at least 15 million in damage as it swept through 5 , 500 acres along the northern edges of altadena and pasadena a row of blackened walls and chimneys was all that was left today of some of the exclusive homes in the san gabriel mountains the police arrested a transient , andres huang , 39 , who they say started the blaze after the nighttime campfire he built on a hillside on the edge of angeles national forest jumped out of control mr huang was scheduled to be arraigned on friday on a charge of setting an unlawful fire he was not accused of arson at least two of the dozen other fires that have swept southern california in the last two days have been attributed to arson about 90 percent of the 12 , 000 large and small wildfires in california each year are caused by people rather than by other sources , like lightning the first report of the altadena fire came at 3 49 am on wednesday , and the heavy response reflected the lessons firefighters have learned in recent years in responding to wildfires in urban areas five engines , four hand crews , two helicopters and a bulldozer were called in , inspector pearson said in most cases , the bulk of the crew would immediately withdraw when the fire was determined to be minor at first , the crew was overwhelmed the fire raced down scrubfilled eaton canyon , attacking a number of homes at the northwest edge of pasadena as its threat grew , a fullfledged mobilization was put into effect more than 140 fire engines from around the state mobilized on the streets to await the unpredictable spread of the fire from the brushcovered canyons and hillsides air attack on blaze nearby a halfdozen crews of 15 or so men and women , including prison inmates , moved onto the hillsides with picks and shovels to cut firebreaks most of the injuries to firefighters were among these crews , inspector pearson said , though none of the injuries were serious as the crews worked on the ground , a c130 aircraft spread fire retardant chemicals in the path of the blaze and six helicopters fitted with 360gallon canisters made repeated runs to dump water on the flames after the air attack , helicopters then carried crews into remote areas to cut fire lines , inspector pearson said the more california is threatened by these fires of the future , ms terrill said , the more sophisticated the crews become in combating them but with virtually every fire , she added , mother nature is more powerful than we are firefighters are learning to be satisfied with small victories we have isolated successes here and there , ms terrill said we have our biggest successes when mother nature settles down a bit photo the wildfire that swept altadena , calif , destroyed or damaged 115 homes on wednesday and forced the evacuation of 500 other homes the damage amounted to at least 15 million harry higley surveyed what was left of his home of 29 years on kinneloa canyon road \( marissa roth for the new york times \)

a rare persian goblet valued at 500 , 000 and other precious works of persian and french art were stolen yesterday from a midtown manhattan gallery , the police said investigators said the burglars took an estimated 11 million in artwork from the alex gallery at 11 east 57th street after using a sledgehammer to break down the front door the yearold gallery specializes in islamic art and antiques from around the world , including egypt and the middle east , said its director , john aryeh this greatly affects us because we opened an exhibition on monday , he said the exhibition focuses on persianmogul miniature paintings on paper that date to the 14th century mr aryeh would not say whether any items from the exhibition were stolen private alarm went off the gallery s private alarm went off about 12 55 am tuesday , the police said the alarm company called the owner , accompanied him to the thirdfloor art gallery and found that the metal door had been bashed in , said lieut joseph a pollini , head of the major case squad of the new york city police department it looked pretty bad , he said all the locks had been punched out investigators are speculating that the robbery may have been done for a collector who failed to tell the burglars what items to take , because 8 pieces of a 20part series were left behind maybe the problem was that they saw police arriving from the gallery s large picture window that overlooks 57th street and grabbed what they could , he said investigators also said they thought the work was done for a collector because the sixstory building has several art galleries and none of them were disturbed besides the persian goblet , which is from the fifth century bc , the burglars took 12 paintings depicting the history of the rulers of persia , valued at 220 , 000 and dating to the 18th century a 17thcentury french tapestry valued at 60 , 000 , and an 1875 persian silk carpet valued at 325 , 000 , the police said photo the alex gallery on east 57th street , specializing in islamic art , was burglarized yesterday , and an estimated 11 million in artwork was taken a police investigator at the scene looked out of the showroom window of the sixstory building , which houses several other galleries \( joyce dopkeen the new york times \)
san francisco investor confusion may be the best explanation for the pounding taken wednesday by shares of calgene inc , the leading agricultural biotechnology company , after the clinton administration published new regulations that were , in fact , exactly what the company had been seeking calgene fell 1125 wednesday , to 1075 , or roughly half its 52week high , in nasdaq trading most other agricultural biotech stocks were essentially flat , but they have nearly all been depressed for some time calgene recovered a bit yesterday , gaining 375 cents , to 11125 the primary impact of the new regulations is that field trials of six genetically engineered crops for which there is significant previous history tomatoes , tobacco , potatoes , corn , cotton and soybeans can be conducted 30 days after notifying the agriculture department permits are not required , though the department can disallow a trial if it finds cause former vice president dan quayle s council on competitiveness had called for eliminating the advance notification , essentially deregulating the process altogether the worst thing that ever happened to agricultural biotech was the council on competitiveness , roger salquist , calgene s president and chief executive , said in a telephone interview from company headquarters in davis , calif the industry has always said it wanted credible federal oversight the american people want oversight he said the 30day notification period allows for that oversight but does not unnecessarily burden the process for reviewing crops that are known to be safe i have spent 90 percent of my time the past three months pounding on the floor , trying to get these exact rules passed , mr salquist said this is absolutely the right thing asked why his stock fell anyway , he noted some published reports carried a negative slant , suggesting the new regulations were a setback for the industry , and said , just because somebody says they 're an analyst does n't mean they have any brains another change in the regulations removes language suggesting that researchers could determine for themselves whether they needed a agriculture department permit no one liked that except a few academic scientists , said rebecca goldberg , a biotechnology analyst for the environmental defense fund changes were put in place by the council on competitiveness that they thought were ideologically correct , but which in fact did not serve industry , environmentalists or the states' interests changes won by environmentalists included strengthening government prohibitions against the spread of genetically engineered crops into fields of natural plants , and requiring agriculture department permits for genetically engineered plants containing pharmaceuticals this in no way hurts calgene it in some ways helps them , ms goldberg said indeed , none of the changes will be onerous for the industry , said james mccamant , editor of the ag biotech stock letter calgene s stock got clobbered and it was totally unwarranted , he said noting that the one company whose shares suffered was the very one lobbying for the changes , he added , people have gotten confused the new regulations deal only with field trials , and not with genetically engineered plants once they are commercialized , which falls outside the agriculture department s purview but the preamble to the rules states that they should be viewed as interim , and the clinton administration will further review the commercialization of agribiotech products the ballgame s just begun , ms goldberg said
wisconsin s welfare reform putting a twoyear limit on benefits would seem to have come straight out of president clinton s playbook during the campaign , he promised to end welfare as we know it by making benefits temporary no wonder then that the administration granted its approval for wisconsin s plan last week but a closer look shows that the two policies veer in starkly different directions mr clinton wants to guarantee a job for parents who reach the end of the twoyear period wisconsin does n't mr clinton pledges generous education and training programs before the benefits run out wisconsin does n't and mr clinton s advisers recognize that for welfare reform to work , it must protect children from penalties meted out to delinquent parents wisconsin does n't wisconsin , under gov tommy thompson , a republican , will pick two counties for the experimental reform welfare recipients will initially be directed into training and education , but only for at most one year during the second year , enrollees will work off their benefits in private or public jobs after 24 months of welfare , the guaranteed jobs disappear and cash assistance is cut off for three years the state would continue to provide food stamps , health care and , in a small number of cases , housing vouchers to critics , the wisconsin plan is n't just tough it s vicious what happens to parents who , for no fault of their own , ca n't find work \? where will they get cash to buy their children soap , clothes , bus fare let alone an occasional book or movie ticket \? wisconsin only promises to extend benefits beyond 24 months if the local job market is dreadful but that would still leave many unemployed in the lurch nor would wisconsin help children of delinquent parents who refuse to show up for work if they do n't work , the family loses all but health benefits and food stamps though mr clinton s plan wo n't be out until next year , his statements suggest that he will at least provide the poor an opportunity to earn cash assistance through community service and , unlike wisconsin , he s struggling to figure out how to insulate kids from the failure of their parents the underlying presumption of the wisconsin plan is that ablebodied parents who know for certain that their benefits will end , and that no job will be automatically offered to them , will figure out how to find steady work as proof that aggressive management can work , wisconsin points to its enviable record driving down welfare rolls the past eight years the wisconsin plan might make progress in moving some welfare recipients off the rolls and into productive work but there are virtually certain to be some ugly outcomes and even if the experiment works to some degree , it is unlikely to be a model for reform elsewhere in the country the experiment is isolated to relatively few families in only two counties , yet to be picked but probably prosperous , in an economically healthy state that would allow wisconsin to sidestep the problems faced by urban centers where an increasing number of poor parents cannot find or hold steady jobs the country has engaged in rounds of experiments with jobs programs , combining different levels of carrots and sticks at best , these reforms move a few unemployed into jobs none are hugely successful wisconsin s harsh plan does n't match the president s inviting rhetoric but that does n't mean he should have rejected the application the president has pledged to provide states the leeway to experiment with social programs and wisconsin s track record on welfare reform is sufficiently encouraging to warrant giving it a long leash the danger , however , is that should the plan backfire it will tarnish mr clinton s more generous approach that would strive to replace welfare with a humane , effective alternative
milwaukee , sept 13 george steinbrenner must be a genius hours after he met with manager buck showalter and his coaching staff , meandered through the clubhouse with a stern look and told reporters that the yankees must respond to the pennantrace challenge , they actually did for a night of course , jimmy key s magnificent pitching had more to do with the yankees taming the brewers , 31 , tonight at county stadium than any words steinbrenner uttered after an 88minute storm delayed the first pitch , key stifled milwaukee on four hits over six innings after a second delay of 62 minutes , steve farr and lee smith notched the last nine outs and helped the yankees win for the second time in seven games on this dangerous road trip a few hundred of the 11 , 125 fans stayed for all nine innings steinbrenner was one of them with two rookies in the rotation until certain injuries heal , the yankees need key s precise pitching more now than ever before key , who had struggled to a 43 record and 435 earned run average in his last 10 starts , resembled the lefthander who dominated the american league for the first half of the season in guiding the yankees to within one and onehalf games of the firstplace blue jays and into second place toronto was idle and baltimore lost to boston , 64 , to slip two games behind the jays into third place after their pregame team meeting , it was comforting for showalter to watch the unflappable key because his starters had compiled an 03 record and 654 earned run average in the first six games on this trip key might have won his last start on this trip in texas last tuesday , but the relievers did not protect a 32 lead and lost , 54 the bullpen succeeded tonight with farr pitching one and twothirds innings and smith recording the last four outs for his first save as a yankee and the 399th in his career key \( 175 \) improved his record after yankee setbacks to 102 and maintained his chances of winning 20 games with four starts remaining there s no other way to describe what jimmy has done for us and continues to do for us , said showalter he s been there all year , that s the biggest accolade you can pay a pitcher trying to erase their road problems for one night , the yankees nicked jaime navarro for two runs in the third and one run in the fourth to continue their amazing offensive success against the righthander entering the game , the yankees had scored 30 runs in their last 32 1 3 innings off navarro \( 1010 \) and he did not reverse the trend navarro had won three straight starts , but the yankees humbled him mike gallego collected new york s first hit when he singled to open the third inning , advanced to second on randy velarde s walk and scored when wade boggs slapped a single to left field after velarde was thrown out at the plate on a groundout and don mattingly struck out , danny tartabull assured the yankees of another run by smacking a single past shortstop pat listach the old reliable the fourth could have been much more devastating for navarro , but he managed to tiptoe through the inning mike stanley , gallego and velarde each belted oneout singles to fill the bases for the top of the order boggs then walked on four pitches to increase the lead to 30 and navarro looked like he might be done , but the yankees fizzled meanwhile , key was being the reliable key against the brewers only more rain before the game could have saved the brewers as key sailed through six innings , surrendering only juan bell s double and darryl hamilton s runscoring single in the sixth the brewers had three other baserunners in the first five innings , but none made it past first it was key s night it was just what george wanted inside pitch yankees manager buck showalther said after the game that bob wickman will start tuesday s game rookie pitcher domingo jean has been sent to the bullpen both scott kamieniecki \( sore right hamstring \) and melido perez \( sore right shoulder \) tested their injuries by throwing before tonight s game , but the yankees only reported encouraging news about kamieniecki they hope that kamieniecki can pitch thursday against boston at yankee stadium , where he has won 12 straight home games perez s immediate future is unclear the yankees have won 15 of their last 22 games against milwaukee photo brewers catcher dave nilsson tagging out ynakees' randy velarde as he tried to score on a groundout during the third inning last night in milwaukee \( associated press \)
stratford , ontario , sept 4 of all of shakespeare s titular monarchs , poor , weakwilled king john has always been the ungainly stepchild the play that bears his name , a bafflingly amphibious blend of history and tragedy , was seldom performed in this century until relatively recently and most productions and analyses of the life and death of king john have tended to emphasize the more dynamic character of the bastard , the patriotic son of richard the lionhearted , over john himself , who has all of macbeth s infirmity of purpose with none of his more olympian qualities the great interest of robin phillips s emotionally gripping , if somewhat muddled , production at the stratford festival here is that it makes john its unconditional center and , in doing so , presents him as a disturbingly pertinent statesman for our times macbeth and richard iii , with their portraits of raveningly ambitious , machiavellian heads of state , were the perfect choices for politically slanted revivals in the paranoiac heyday of the late 60 s and early 70 s , the years of johnson and nixon king john , on the other hand , has vital resonance for an age that often sees its politicians less as monsters than mediocrities , distanced from greatness by alltoopedestrian frailties as cannily played by nicholas pennell , a veteran of the festival , john is undone not so much by heroic hubris as by an almost childish ineffectuality he has been brought up by a domineering mother to assume all the postures of majesty yet , forced to take charge of a byzantine territorial dispute with france that threatens his very possession of the english crown , he eventually turns into a peevish mixture of willfulness and insecurity , manifested in tantrums and literal weakness of the knees by this production s end the shell of regal arrogance has shattered , exposing a petulant , touchingly confused soul the cornerstone relationship between john and his mother , eleanor of aquitaine \( janet wright \) , is dominant in this version in the play s early court and warcouncil scenes , john cannot deliver a single declaration of strategy without glancing quickly to eleanor for corroboration moving like the prow of a ship and clutching a walking cane as though it were a weapon , ms wright is the mother as soldier of the text , glowing with smug martial strength clearly , john draws his energy to act entirely from her , and once he learns of her death , in the play s second half , he is launched on a frenzied flight toward selfdissolution on other levels , this production is less satisfying the thematic development of king john hinges crucially on the evolution of the character of philip the bastard , whom john makes his chief aide after learning he is his illegitimate nephew , from tentative , wry selfinterest to nationalistic selflessness as played with flashing charisma by stephen ouimette , this philip is a fixed moral polestar from the play s beginning and he delivers the famous early soliloquy on commodity , or calculating selfinterest , less as a groping meditation than a trenchant choral commentary this does have the effect of shifting the focus even more to john , but it also robs the production of an essential element of complexity king john shares with the chronicle plays a very broad canvas , with a more cynical emphasis on how commodity shapes the motives of an international host of feuding characters unfortunately , mr phillips is not always clear in defining their relative places on the political spectrum it does n't help that the play has been staged with costumes , settings and music that evoke world war i this allows mr phillips to create some ironically genteel tableaux of strife and carnage , which recall joan littlewood s oh ! what a lovely war , and much smoldering stoicism over tea cups and brandy snifters but it generates unnecessary confusion in a play in which france and england are antagonists , not allies , and the papacy could still bring an english king to his knees mr phillips has clearly tried to impose some sort of teleologicalhistorical pattern on this sprawling play by underlining significant turns of plot with swells of astral music , pools of light and miked amplification of key spoken lines , as well as by grouping his characters in configurations that suggest pieces on a chessboard this can occasionally be illuminating more often , it is simply picturesque the director is far better on psychological specifics , particularly the poignant clashes of public and personal identities the startled look of dispossession on the face of john s niece , blanche \( michelle fisk \) , as she hears herself being clinically discussed as a pawn in a politically expedient marriage , is truly heartbreaking and as constance , the mother of a child with a fatal claim to john s throne , goldie semple is superb , a fierce portrait of patrician poise unraveling beneath the conflicting burdens of maternal ambition and maternal solicitude as hubert , the reluctant assassin torn between compassion and soldierly allegiance , scott wentworth provides another affecting study in ambivalence , a trait that , appropriately , haunts this entire production king john by william shakespeare directed by robin phillips costumes by ann curtis music by don horsburgh lighting by louise guinand sound by keith handegord movement choreographed by john broome stage manager , anne murphy presented by the stratford festival , david william , artistic director at stratford , ontario king john nicholas pennell queen eleanor janet wright philip stephen ouimette constance goldie semple hubert scott wentworth blanche michelle fisk photo william webster , michelle fisk and nicholas pennell in king john , at the stratford festival in ontario \( cylla von tiedmann stratford festival \)
foxboro , mass one day during the construction of bill parcells s new home not far from the patriots complex here , his wife judy asked him about a certain brand of kitchencounter material do you want corian \? she said can he block \? her husband said once a coach , always a coach and against the jets tonight , the coach who guided the giants to two super bowl championships will be on the opposite sideline at giants stadium for the first time as the new england patriots' coach but it s not a homecoming for bill parcells , because new jersey is no longer where he works or lives i'm not on any social trip , he was saying friday on the road , i never leave my hotel room except to go to a players' meeting i 'll watch tv and try to relax , but i 'll study the game plan i have to hang around because it s a night game what time , he was asked , will you get the players up in the morning \? i do n't get the players up , he said they get themselves up they know where and when they have to be we do n't have any wakeup calls on this team none have been necessary since this frustrated franchise got its wakeup call last january when parcells was hired anybody , he declared that day , who has their own agenda that s separate from the team s wo n't be around long when wide receiver hart lee dykes told parcells that he would be going home for a week during the off season instead of rehabbing his right knee , the coach said , why do n't you go home for good \? when dykes suggested that he go home just for the weekend , the coach said , i 'll help you pack your bags dykes did n't go home he toiled to rehab his right knee , but then his left knee collapsed life has been like that for the patriots , who have never won the super bowl , who in their early years never won the american football league title , and who this season have not won any of their three games but until now , the patriots never had a coach with bill parcells s credentials or his timing only a few national football league coaches have been blessed with the first draft choice in their first year on the job when a touted college quarterback was available four years ago , jimmy johnson , in his first draft as the dallas cowboy coach , chose troy aikman , now the quarterback of the reigning super bowl champions this year , parcells had the first choice most draftniks assumed that the patriots' new coach would select rick mirer , the notre dame quarterback , a decision that would surely please the large catholic population in new england it would also let the seattle seahawks take drew bledsoe , out of washington state , with the second choice except that parcells took bledsoe even after the san francisco 49ers offered parcells all their 1993 draft choices for the no 1 pick parcells has seldom trusted rookies of all the giants rookies during parcells s eight seasons , only lawrence taylor was an instant starter but the patriots coach trusts bledsoe so far this season the 6foot5inch , 233pound rookie has thrown more passes than any other nfl quarterback he has completed 62 of 123 for 627 yards and four touchdowns with four interceptions and seven sacks we could 've won two games if drew had made a right decision , parcells said , with more tolerance than complaint but he s a good solid young guy he calls a spade a spade he s not sensitive , but i have n't treated him like i treated phil simms parcells laughed , remembering his occasional outbursts with his longtime giants quarterback but by the time i was the giants head coach , simms was starting his fifth season , parcells said it s different with a rookie you just try to point out things to him but since he s in the job , he s got to do the job and he knows that he s pretty good for the patriots coach , the phrase pretty good is a rave review , especially for a rookie quarterback in rebuilding with the new 53player roster , parcells has retained 17 rookies or firstyear players and 12 secondyear players one of those rookies is secondround choice chris slade , a linebacker out of virginia , where his 40 career sacks broke the atlantic coast conference record of 29 set by l t himself he s had five sacks in the last two games not that parcells has given him a rave review , yet slade , the coach said , is like a ball in tall grass lost that s typical of parcells s motivational remarks but the patriots' future also will depend on when and if james orthwein sells the club it s on the market now , but if you 're interested , bring at least 140 million it s important , parcells said , that we get the right new owner until then , the patriot coach will be busy trying to change his more prominent image as the giants' excoach by the way , what did he think of the giants' 30 start under their new coach , dan reeves \? i have n't seen a giants film , he said photo bill parcells speaking with linebacker vincent brown last sunday as the patriots lost their third game \( associated press \)

an investigation by the internal revenue service has some highpowered lawyers looking to hire some highpowered lawyers and some accountants are sharpening their pencils to take care of their own tardy tax returns district offices in new york , chicago and pittsburgh have begun efforts to track down lawyers and accountants who have failed to file tax returns , the washington post reported yesterday since last fall , the irs has been on a campaign to get lapsed taxpayers to own up the recent local effort to crack down on professionals is a matter of district offices taking the campaign an extra step , said frank keith , a spokesman for the irs in new york , 50 lawyers have been selected so far as possible offenders , mr keith said the agency came up with its list of lawyers by examining the informational partnership filings of major new york law firms schedule k1 of those returns , which told what each partner earned , provided the irs the list of names and social security numbers it needed to run a computer search for form 1040 individual tax returns robert s fink , a tax law specialist at kostelanetz ritholz tigue and fink , said he had been retained to represent close to a dozen of the laywers on that list who have heard from irs criminal investigators he said that his clients , whom he would not name , ranged in age from the mid30 s to 55 , and were all employed at large firms in the city in one case , said mr fink , a client had not filed a tax return in five years the result of an emotional crisis in his family in several cases , the same law firm has more than one lawyer being represented by mr fink mr fink said none of his clients were senior partners at their firms as many as 10 million individuals and businesses neglect to file their taxes each year , depriving the government of 7 billion to 9 billion in taxes , said mr keith , the irs spokesman an amnesty program announced last fall is aimed at encouraging delinquents to come forward and work out installment agreements , in which case the irs might waive criminal charges , and even penalties if the taxpayer can show reasonable cause such as family tragedy or some traumatic event , mr keith said frequently , taxpayers who have suffered upheaval in their lives fail to file a return in the year of the trauma , mr keith explained then , in the second year , they do n't file because of fear of what they did the previous year , he said thus , the irs outreach program seeks to entice such taxpayers into returning to the system by waiving penalties mr fink , however , said the current effort against lawyers had failed to show such benevolence the irs all of a sudden has a double standard one for all the citizens of america and one for lawyers , mr fink said with the lawyers , rather than the collection division contacting you and asking , 'where is your return \? ' , the criminal division is contacting them from the outset mr keith said the policy of the irs was to allow the amnesty options as long as the taxpayer has not been contacted by agents of our criminal investigation division nonfilers can be a particular problem for the accounting and law firms that employ them , said harvey coustan , chairman of the tax division of the american institute of certified public accountants if a nonfiling partner at a professional firm were to be prohibited by the irs from arguing cases in administrative hearings , the entire firm could be excluded , mr coustan explained in february , the institute s 320 , 000 members received a letter from jake l netterville , its chairman , noting that the irs had confirmed that it indeed found noncompliant cpa s who could soon be contacted accountants who had not filed returns for a year or more are strongly encouraged to do so immediately to avoid criminal prosecution , mr netterville wrote
washington , feb 5 in his waning months as america s senior soldier , gen colin l powell is struggling to balance loyalties to a new commander in chief whose ideas clash with his , and to a tightly knit military culture he feels bound to protect challenges to these fealties are piling up fast general powell s sharp criticism last week of president clinton s plan to allow homosexuals in the armed forces prompted some administration officials to suggest that his behavior had bordered on insubordination , a notion he vehemently rejects defense secretary les aspin s order to the pentagon this week to cut 14 billion from next year s budget was the first step toward cutting 200 , 000 more troops than general powell has argued is militarily prudent a tactical retreat and the general s recent decision to back off his earlier modest recommendations to reduce overlapping roles and missions in the military seemed to signal a tactical retreat to avoid adding an internecine battle among the joint chiefs of staff to an already turbulent pentagon transition with his term expiring on sept 30 , some administration and pentagon officials are asking , will the most popular and politically powerful chairman of the joint chiefs in years spend his final months as a faithful commander or as a subtle obstructionist \? general powell , who has made it clear he is angry and hurt at newspaper editorials that have questioned his support of the new administration , has refused all requests for interviews but at an official military welcoming ceremony for mr aspin last monday at fort myer , va , he sent a peace offering to his civilian bosses and a clear message to the troops we know that there will be changes , and as we work through these changes you can count on us to provide the most candid professional advice we can , general powell said you and the commander in chief can always count on us for faithful support and execution of your decisions general powell is a professional soldier who will dutifully follow his president s orders but friends and associates say he is equally driven by an emotional , almost mystical , commitment to the 18millionmember armed forces , and to a military culture that has defined his 35year career he summed up his feelings at a speech in november to the professional services council i care about strategy , he said i care about force structure i care about doctrine i care about all the papers that come out of think tanks telling me what to do but the thing that really counts when the strategy changes or turns out not to have been right , what really does count is the quality of the force you 've got to see our force as a human living organism and treat it as such what worries general powell , friends and associates say , is his belief that mr clinton and , to a lesser extent , mr aspin do not fully understand or respect his cherished institution it is an uneasy feeling shared by many in the armed forces a senior navy officer who served in the persian gulf war expressed concern , for example , that in promising to lift the ban on gay men and lesbians in the military , mr clinton had not thought through the consequences 'a very emotional issue' there have been strains , particularly among the rank and file , because they feel disenfranchised , like no one asked what would happen to them , said the officer , who spoke on the condition of anonymity anyone on this side of the fence could have told you this would be a very emotional issue the law allows general powell , who is 55 , to serve a third twoyear term as head of the joint chiefs but custom dictates that he leave after four years , and he says he will since the persian gulf war , general powell has been the subject of speculation about his political potential but he has dismissed such suggestions so far , and is mulling over a range of book offers , business deals , speaking engagements and seats on corporate boards he 'd like to be president of something like the ford foundation or american red cross , where he could do some good for humanity , said one friend speculation about general powell s successor has centered on gen lee butler and gen merrill a mcpeak of the air force , adm paul david miller of the navy and gen john shalikashvili of the army but many officers fear that none of these candidates , no matter how able , can fill the current chairman s shoes general powell , a soldierstatesman , is charming and has a populist touch no graduate of west point , he was a south harlem youth , the son of jamaican immigrants , who got c s and d s at city college in new york majoring in geology , took four and a half years to graduate and became an army officer through the reserve officer training corps his blend of combat experience and political savvy gives him the ability to talk tough with the troops deep in the saudi desert and to deliver spellbinding testimony to skeptical lawmakers on capitol hill after powell goes , advocacy for the military in this administration will be substantially lessened , said one army officer on the staff of the joint chiefs i do n't see anyone on the horizon who 'll carry that kind of clout in congress or in the military the general s critics , primarily in research centers and in congress , contend that he is a conservative commander whose doctrine of decisive and overwhelming force may have been fitting in panama and iraq but is irrelevant to a world where violent nationalism and ethnic hostilities have supplanted superpower conflicts general powell , these critics say , shies away from innovation in favor of tinkering with the status quo to shield the men and women in the armed forces from disruptive change the general has argued , for example , that lifting the ban on homosexuals in the military would undermine morale and hurt what little privacy members of the armed forces now have his remarks fueled last week s debate powell went beyond giving advice to the commander in chief , said representative barney frank , a massachusetts democrat who is one of two openly gay lawmakers in congress he s trying to submarine the president politically fulfilling an obligation but general powell s supporters say that he and the other chiefs were fulfilling their obligation to give the president their honest assessment the duty of the joint chiefs of staff is to give their best , candid and unvarnished advice to the commander in chief until he makes a decision , said richard l armitage , a senior state department official and a close friend of general powell then it becomes an order , and they carry it out to the best of their ability mr aspin s proposed budget reductions will most likely accelerate troop cuts , requiring forced dismissals from the allvolunteer military , senior army officials say associates say this latest round of cuts could pose the greatest test of general powell s ingenuity in trying to avoid disruption in the armed forces , and of his loyalty to the administration this budget cut will require the military departments to involuntarily separate and retire people , said senator john w warner of virginia , the senior republican on the senate armed services committee who has known general powell since he was a young major that s got to be an exceedingly painful realization for powell photos we know that there will be changes , said gen colin l powell you can count on us to provide the most candid professional advice we can \( jose r lopez the new york times \) \( pg 1 \) associates say

geneva , monday , dec 13 with time running out , trade negotiators struck one important deal overnight but remained stuck on another yet american and some european officials are optimistic that the 116nation trade talks can be finished in the three days they have left that attitude may seem odd in light of the apparent obduracy of the unsettled issue , how to share the hundreds of millions of dollars that european governments pocket each year on fees on american movies but the officials say that it is no wonder that the movie issue is harder than the question of trade law concerning steep american tariffs on lowcost imports that they did manage to settle the trade law dispute was a matter of language , and given the battalions of lawyers who have gathered around the talks here , language can usually be finessed and that is just what they did , making 8 of the 11 changes in legal language that the united states had sought the film dispute , on the other hand , simply involves money and such cash deals are hard to finesse , since there is no hiding the bottom line but officials point out that such issues , representing hundreds of billions of dollars , have already been resolved , creating a hefty head of financial steam that they believe will eventually force a way through the standoff over films businesses in america , europe and the rest of the world have already been able to figure the benefits in immediate cash from the compromises already reached for instance , within hours of a transatlantic deal on tuesday on tariffs , which are taxes on imports , american computer chip executives had calculated that the arrangement would save their industry 25 million in 1995 , rising to 897 million in 1999 and every year after that with the momentum of such calculations behind them , american officials strongly believe that the current sticking points films and aircraft can be resolved before the final deadline on wednesday for a conclusion of the sevenyearold round of trade talks even as officials like sir leon brittan , the european community s top trade official , spoke sunday of a bit of a crisis and president clinton made a personal call to prime minister edouard balladur of france , negotiators on both sides were more optimistic in private there is a determination on both sides that none of the remaining ecus issues should even slow down the round , much less bring it to the ground , a european community official said sunday evening still , the remaining disputes are serious and will indirectly affect thousands of jobs and billions of dollars but they are also partly exercises in political theater tussles between the united states and the european community over movies have allowed the clinton administration to present itself as the trade defender of california , a state crucial to the president s reelection prospects , and the community to present itself as the defender of french culture in any case , the final days of any trade negotiations are bound to have a certain amount of brinkmanship , said the european official , who added that mr kantor and sir leon are in effect playing poker , with each reluctant to lay down his cards first the goal of the talks is to reduce tariffs around the world by a third and apply the freetrade rules of the 45yearold general agreement on tariffs and trade to agriculture and service industries for the first time any of the issues which continue to cause concern pale into absolute insignificance in the context of what has generally been already agreed , said peter sutherland , the director general of gatt immediate benefits tariff deals go straight to companies' bottom lines , because they involve tax savings achieved without any extra costs because of the clear financial effects , companies are zealous lobbyists for these deals most of the agricultural disputes that have held up an overall agreement in the trade talks have also involved clear financial effects american farmers know roughly the sales they have lost in overseas markets where european governments spent money to help their farmers buy market share instead , the deal reached early this morning , about rules for imposing tariffs american manufacturers regard as protection against the dumping of goods at less than market prices , involved a more general issue whose effect is harder to quantify but which might be greater over the long run the compromise is also the latest in a series of diplomatic and political victories for mr kantor mr kantor , who spent the summer and fall preparing the north american free trade agreement for congress and then pushing it through , has been using the latest disputes as an opportunity to begin promoting the agreement early to the american public and to various house and senate members who have visited here in recent days and mr kantor and mr sutherland have welcomed the visits by members as a way to involve them in the process long before they have to cast potentially controversial votes on its results

spanish polychrome sculpture \( 15001800 \) in united states collections is a hiddenaway gem of a show modest in size a mere 36 smallish works , in wood and terra cotta and straightforwardly displayed in the basement gallery of the spanish institute , it projects a devotional fervor of surprising power surprising because many of the images gathered here seem far removed from 20thcentury western taste this is n't art with the neoplatonic reserve of the italian renaissance or with the courtly sweep of the northern baroque vivacious , minutely detailed and personal , these painted wooden sculptures have folk art in their blood and rapture and torment on their mind the wounds of a lacerated christ gleam with simulated blood st anthony s blissful smile reveals a set of tiny , inlaid ivory teeth , and an ecstatic st teresa of avila has a carved pink wooden heart concealed within her breast this nearpathological realism is couched in material richness gold paint is everywhere , as is the exquisite , scratchedout surface patterning known as estofado and when bare flesh is depicted , as in the case of the creamwhite body of a penitent st jerome , it has a startling sensuality what is lost in a gallery context , however , is a sense of how this art functioned in its original public setting some of these figures were dressed in robes on feast days and carried into the streets others were components of the massive altar screens called retablos the artists who carved them were reputed to have received the images in mystical trances , and the sculptures themselves were credited with miraculous powers to anyone with a firsthand experience of nonwestern art traditions , like those of india or africa or africaninfluenced latin america , none of this will seem exotic but to viewers accustomed to seeing religious art primarily in museums , spanish polychrome sculpture can be a little hard to take in its most theatrical forms , it can simply feel like too much too religious , too graphic , too decorative , too much of an extreme emotional piece yet , the first thing one notices in the spanish institute show is the work s variety the earliest images , perhaps because they were based on northern european models , are expressively restrained a 15thcentury st george , for example , has the upright carriage of flemish models , though his cloak is bordered with simulated arabic calligraphy , a hispanic motif and sangfroid cannot get much cooler than in a protofeminist st catherine of alexandria , her lofty , dispassionate gaze absorbed in a book as she skewers with her sword a dolefullooking little man squirming beneath her feet such naturalistic details become more frequent and more emphatic in 17th and 18thcentury work , as if to create an ever greater psychological bond between the devotee and the icon sometimes the effect is companionable and familiar , as in a portrait bust of the militant st ignatius loyola , who frowns and chides like a pettish schoolmaster and sometimes it carries a charge of profound , even unhinged ardor the christ in an ecce homo from the yale university art museum , for example , with the veins bulging in the arms and thorns puncturing the skin of the brow , seems intoxicated with pain at this pitch of heightened , almost hallucinatory intensity , spanish religious images appear to be leaving the mainstream traditions of european art behind , and indeed they did exactly that when they traveled to the americas much hispanicamerican sacred art , from the crucifixes carved for mission churches centuries ago to the plaster santos sold across new york city today , can trace their heritage straight to the sculptures in this show and one finds something of their spirit perpetuated in contemporary work , not only that of many latin american artists but also of such influential nonhispanic artists as kiki smith and the late paul thek , whose best work seemed to be grounded in the paradoxical themes of pain and sensuality , and repulsion and redemption , which define the earlier spanish wood carvings whatever the motivations and longterm influences of spanish polychrome sculpture , however , the lasting impression of the work is of a peculiarly dramatic beauty the handmodeled , foothigh terracotta figure of st bernard of clairvaux has an operatic grandeur far beyond its size , and the face of the 18yearold jesuit st stanislaus kostka is as unblemished in its comeliness and as perfect in its composure as any centralasian buddha it is images such as these that will surely bring spanish polychrome sculpture the attention it richly deserves spanish polychrome sculpture \( 15001800 \) in united states collections is to remain at the spanish institute , 684 park avenue , near 68th street , through jan 4 photo a 17thcentury polychrome statue of st ignatius loyola \( meadows museum \)
backstage at the st james theater , the director des mcanuff was summoned to the phone just after the audience had finally stopped cheering for tommy and gone home that was sort of the love call , he explained a few moments later , referring to his conversation with pete townshend , on whose celebrated rock opera the show is based twentyfour hours earlier , mr townshend had been at the st james on a triumphant opening night , after which tommy set a dayafteropening record of nearly 500 , 000 for ticket sales now , back in london , he was maintaining enough of a spiritual presence in new york to time his good wishes precisely to the final curtain no wonder when he wrote the crowd went crazy as tommy hit the stage 24 years ago \( in the lyrics to sally simpson \) , mr townshend nicely anticipated the effect his work would one day have on broadway audiences but it took mr mcanuff , the artistic director of the la jolla playhouse in california and the tonywinning director of big river , to collaborate with the who s mastermind in finding the theatrical heart of tommy together , they have dusted off this rockandroll chestnut and coaxed forth a daring broadway musical the changes overseen by mr mcanuff are so farreaching that it feels as if tommy has been reinvented , though this is still the basic tale of a boy turned by childhood trauma into a deaf , dumb and blind kid , only to emerge from his silence as a charismatic , pinballplaying star musical solos have been broadened into duets or choral numbers a new interplay between adult and boyish tommys strengthens the central character the storytelling has become swift and linear the minimal props whirl across the stage in exuberant motion with a fluid visual backdrop for its story , this sophisticated 6 million production employs 54 projectors for 18 panels at the rear of the stage , images projected onto a gauzy front curtain , television monitors , smoke , mirrors , major mechanical devices beneath the stage floor , and pinball machines that go up in flames or blaze with light all without losing its streamlined nature or precision mr mcanuff had to be persuaded to allow a lighting effect that turns the whole theater into a huge pinball machine to last 11 seconds instead of 7 this was not the work of a pair of fantasists returning to the late 60 s , said the 40yearold mr mcanuff of his collaboration with the 47yearold mr townshend we wanted to do a dramatic version of this piece finished saying goodnight to the cast and crew , mr mcanuff had been surprised by an autograph seeker at the stage door as he headed for a restaurant near the theater now , settled down to dissect tommy over a latenight chicken sandwich , he worked a scene from henry iv into a long explanation of his own acid queen sequence \( one of several in which little tommy is exposed to strong stimuli in this case , a drugaddicted prostitute who may have magical powers that could break his silence \) you 've got to turn to the great teacher when you dramatize something , he said jokingly i do n't mean to be pretentious , but i just ca n't help it he looked pleasantly tired , having almost outlasted john entwistle \( the who s bassist \) during openingnight festivities at an irish bar the night before he would also have looked inconspicuous without the appliqued leather jacket in a bold zebralike pattern , a garment he took off instantly when asked about its origins the producers gave it to me , he said diplomatically i think it , um , evokes the show s logo the jacket was indeed evocative , though not nearly as much as tommy is itself the who s rock opera is so firmly rooted in memories of its era that any broadway modifications were bound to provoke complaints some have suggested that this 90 s tommy , with its gentler , familyminded ending , betrays the toughness of both the 60 s and the who that s the typical selfdestructive side of the intellectual left , replied mr mcanuff to that criticism often , we 've allowed the right wing to abscond with basic notions like family or patriotism we just sit back and allow them to do it , accepting that it must be correct i 've never met anybody who did n't consider families important just on that level alone i reject it he went on to note we were well aware there would be audience members who felt that they kind of own this piece but he emphasized how elliptical the original album actually is about family values and many other things the 1969 tommy is a series of songs , packaged in an order mr townshend never considered sacred and several of them are sung by characters whose identity is never made clear some are performed in a manner that would not work in any other format it was mr townshend himself , after all , who first sang the part of the acid queen mr mcanuff said he approached tommy without preconceptions and without borrowing from ken russell s delirious \( and now dated \) 1975 film he was aware , however , of the extent to which the film had been dominated by nonetoomusical stars singing cameo turns and was glad to escape such limitations in adapting tommy for the stage \( his first version had its premiere last july at the la jolla playhouse \) , he and mr townshend concentrated on character development , dramatic momentum and creating a song order that made more sense
hempstead , li sept 24 when the jets made mo lewis their thirdround draft pick of 1991 , he was the cornerstone of their plans to upgrade their linebacking now , lewis is not only that but also their leading pass rusher , with two quarterback sacks none of this comes as a surprise to the linebackers coach , foge fazio the drafting of lewis , the only rookie to start for the jets in 1991 , was the first move in fazio s program to rebuild his corps from one of the team s weakest units to one of its strongest no 1 , i think linebackers should be the leading tacklers on the team , said fazio mo has always been a physical player and one of our best tacklers he weighs 250 pounds now and gets good hits on people lewis agrees , and is quick to defend his teammates on the defensive line for their noncontribution zero to the team s sack total give them time well , you got to understand now , we 've only played two games and we played against two good quarterbacks , so you ca n't say the defensive line is not doing their job , said lewis , whose 11 jets go against 03 new england sunday night in the meadowlands we played against john elway and dan marino with elway scrambling and marino getting rid of the ball quick , said lewis , who had one sack against denver and one against miami it s just that my opportunity presented itself against miami they did n't give me a blitz or anything still , lewis s two sacks are two more sacks than the total of the jets' starting front line the jets' front four defensive ends marvin washington and jeff lageman , and tackles scott mersereau and leonard marshall \( washington led the jets with 85 sacks last season and marshall had 4 for the giants \) have been shut out of quarterback takedowns paul frase , who plays behind marshall , and don jones , who spells washington , have one sack apiece the other two of the jets' total of 6 sacks have been credited to the team led team in tackles lewis gave a hint of his statistical prowess last season when he switched to the weak side \( the side opposite the tight end \) , where he started all 16 games although he produced only two sacks , lewis led the team in tackles with 145 and tied for the lead in both forced fumbles , with three , and fumble recoveries , with four lewis s switch to the weak side has paid even more dividends this year bobby houston , a plan b pickup from atlanta , moved into lewis s strongside linebacker spot this season and is now seventh on the team in tackles with nine and first in quarterback pressures with four this year s no 1 pick , marvin jones of florida state , is being groomed for middle linebacker , where kyle clifton reigns clifton , the leading tackler in six of his nine years with the jets , has a teamleading 20 tackles this season lewis is right on his heels with 16 'defense dictates' personally , i think it s the scheme of the defense that dictates all of that , lewis said if you get your front guys doing a lot of stunting , where your linebackers have to fill , and if your linebackers get up there and fill and make the tackles , then you know the defense is doing well lewis credits the acquisition of quarterback boomer esiason and the performance of the jets' offense , which leads the national football league in overall offense and in passing , with the improved showing of the jets' defense esiason has managed to rest the defense by keeping the offense on the field , and the jets now rank second in the league against the run and 19th in defense over all , although they are only 26th against the pass when you can keep the defense off the field and have the offense make a drive and keep the ball 9 and 10 minutes , that s a big thing , lewis said
directors' cuts of highprofile feature films , which are a videodisk staple , are making their way to videotape directors' cuts of ridley scott s blade runner and james cameron s abyss will be available on videotape later this year here is a look at two directors' cuts of hit feature films now available on videocassette j f k director s cut , 206 minutes \( warner home video 12614 \) because it is essentially a collage of short scenes and snippets of news woven into a mock documentary , oliver stone s j f k lends itself more readily than conventional narrative films to absorbing more material without seeming distended the director s cut version , which is 17 minutes longer than the one released in theaters in 1991 , adds a number of new pieces to the assassination puzzle , which make it even more complicated without shedding any more light the scene in the sixth floor of the texas school book depository has been extended to include speculation about the possible role played by a cia official who was dismissed by president john f kennedy there is a goofy scene of jim garrison \( kevin costner \) appearing on a crude parody of the tonight show , where his attempts to display photographs of the three mystery tramps arrested in dallas the day of the assassination are laughingly thwarted by a johnny carsonlike host equally bizarre is a scene in which garrison is the object of an unsuccessful attempt to set him up in a homosexual encounter in an airport men s room in los angeles these and other restorations add an extra layer of paranoia to a film that is already suffused with a profound sense of dread and betrayal fatal attraction the paramount directors' series , 159 minutes \( paramount 12881 \) the main attraction of the home video of the 1987 blockbuster is an epilogue that shows the film s original ending , in which alex forrest \( glenn close \) was not quite the knifewielding maniac she became in the final version in the more emotionally muted original ending , alex gives up the chase and dies in a madama butterfly inspired ritual , while dan gallagher \( michael douglas \) is snared in a plot twist worthy of alfred hitchcock although the original scene gives dan s wife \( anne archer \) some of her best moments , it has none of the visceral clout of the bathtub bloodbath that had audiences screaming in horrified delight also included is an interview with the director , adrian lynes , who introduces rehearsal scenes and some short outtakes and remarks on matters ranging from the film s casting to its use of music students of film acting should especially enjoy a rehearsal scene in which a 15second swatch of provocative dialogue between ms close and mr douglas is repeated with varying inflections until the nuances are exactly what the director wants
chicago , june 1 anthony young sat transfixed as the television screen inside the mets' clubhouse flashed one terrible sequence after another there was a single to left field and then a single barely inside the bag at third there was a doubleplay grounder that became a single because a hitandrun play was on there was a double to the ivy wall in leftcenter and a tworun single to right young , cursing occasionally at no one in particular , kept staring at the screen i watched all of it , said young , the righthander for the mets the hits kept coming , the noises of wrigley field rumbling up the long , winding runway from the dugout to the clubhouse the cubs riddled the mets for four more runs in the eighth inning , the final two coming on closer randy myers s firstever extrabase hit the final score was cubs 8 , mets 3 young at last rose from his seat , his chance at his first victory in more than a year squashed , his six innings of virtual perfection wasted and worthless his streak of consecutive defeats remained at 19 it did n't end , said young young , an emergency starter , had shut out the cubs for six innings he had allowed three hits and struck out four , and departed with a 10 lead and the admiration of the manager it should have been an inspiration to people , dallas green said the mets are always most inspired when conspiring to undo themselves mike draper , who started the seventh , got one out before being mercifully hooked , his line strewn with three hits and three earned runs mike maddux , compounding draper s collapse in the seventh , staged a sideshow of incompetence in the eighth his night s work included six hits allowed and five runs i do n't know where the heck maddux s pitches were , said green most of them were in the outfield from what i saw optimism in the morning young , then , was left facing greater ignominy his 19 straight defeats , which tie him with craig anderson for the club record , are the most in baseball since 1964 and are 4 shy of the record that has stood since 1911 when i woke up , said young , i had a strong feeling it would end indeed , young blazed through the cubs he got every critical out , often in bunches as the cubs beat the baseball across the infield and into double plays he struck out mark grace with a slow curve in the fourth , a pitch he had put in cold storage during his long tenure in the bullpen he saw rick wilkins and greg hibbard punched out to close out the fifth and strand the tying run at second he busted a fastball in on ryne sandberg in the sixth after a twoout walk to grace to get a harmless pop to second and his evening s final out everything you could have wanted he gave , green said of young he pitched very professionally green had no intention of pitching him any longer , and young was done when chico walker pinchhit for him in the seventh with a man on second and two out 'he did it beautifully' he was asked to do something he is n't trained to do , something he has n't been asked to do , and he did it beautifully , said green he gave us six innings he felt good about himself you get him out of there the mets were out of it within minutes draper , largely unused by green , gave up a oneout single to sammy sosa and then an infield hit to steve buechele sosa stole third to deepen the crisis , and then draper made a pitch to wilkins that looked great for an instant if a hitandrun play had not been in effect , wilkins s grounder might have been a doubleplay ball instead , it wound up in the outfield the mets then went on to a complete their surrender maddux gave up a double to doug jennings to yield the goahead run a tworun dwight smith single followed the travesty of bullpen work sunk further in the eighth after runscoring hits by bobby bonilla and joe orsulak had got the mets to within 43 maddux gave up a single to sandberg and consecutive doubles to derrick may and sosa the score was 63 he then was crushed by myers s double that scored the final two runs it was a perfect night to end it , said young it did n't happen inside pitch manager dallas green , clearly upset by the play of tony fernandez , has effectively put the shortstop on notice that his play and approach to the game must improve or he could be benched i'm trying to be as compassionate as i can be , said green tony has had real physical problems , none of which are much fun but i think the problems have affected his mental approach to the game green said his coaching staff had begun to work with fernandez on positioning and throws across the diamond i admit watching his throwing has not been a pretty thing , and he has thrown some balls that have made you wonder , green said he s going through a difficult time i'm not sure we have a handle on it fernandez has battled kidney stones , thumb and sinus trouble this season and batted 197 with a halfdozen errors at short green also indicated the mets would likely be without pitcher sid fernandez , who is recovering from knee surgery , until at least until after the allstar game break next month
washington now that the bosnian serbs have defied the international community by burying the vanceowen peace plan under the rubble of new artillery attacks , president clinton and our allies must take further steps , including military force , to stop the genocidal slaughter of civilians but there are deep divisions in congress and in our military not only over what these steps should be but also over why the us should get involved at all the reasons , in fact , are far more crucial to our national interests than than those that led us to send 500 , 000 soldiers to defend the dictatorship and the oil of kuwait first , we must act because our moral integrity as the leader of the democratic world is at stake the west must not turn its back once again on genocide in europe further , our national security is inextricably linked to the stability of europe as it struggles to adjust to the downfall of communism democracy is by no means secure in central and eastern europe allowing the invasion of the sovereign nation of bosnia to go unpunished would send a dangerous signal to those who are determined to undermine democratic progress , for example , in the former soviet union twice in this century , because of europe s inertia , we have had to go to war to save that continent for much of this century , our children have lived under the threat of communism and american taxpayers have financed hundreds of billions of dollars in military spending the west must do everything in its power now to insure that democracy takes hold throughout europe if we do n't , the consequences could be disastrous finally , we must not forget that europe represents america s largest trading partner an unstable europe could damage our own economy and , after several factfinding trips over the past three years to the former yugoslavia , there is no question in my mind that this conflict , if left unchecked , will soon intensify and spread into neighboring countries weighing these critical factors convinces me that america can no longer afford to sit on the sidelines the international community s only option is military intervention the president has said , correctly , that we must act in concert with our allies , and he has sent secretary of state warren christopher to develop a decisive policy with them us military planners are drafting several options , from limited air strikes to participation in a significant nato ground force i have , for example , been advocating air strikes on serbian supply depots and the lifting of the arms embargo on bosnia and herzegovina the purpose of allied air strikes would be to inflict punitive damage on the serbian militants in bosnia , and to send a powerful message to wouldbe aggressors throughout the world at the same time , allied air power could provide cover for the bosnians while they acquire arms to defend themselves others believe that a much larger effort must be made i am not opposed to that if a strong case can be made to those who believe that any us military solution is a prelude to a vietnamtype disaster , i can only ask have we learned nothing from the past \? how long will we remain paralyzed by previous mistakes \? the air force chief of staff , gen merrill mcpeak , recently testified before congress that the relatively scarce and unsophisticated surfacetoair weapons available to the bosnian serbs would permit an aerial campaign that would pose virtually no risk to ourselves if the united states , with the finest military in the world , cannot stem resurgent fascism , what are we , the only superpower , all about \? those who are urging no involvement may sound like they are giving wise counsel in fact , they are advocating a policy that is much riskier to our national security we must act now , through nato , to stop the killing further delay could leave us no choice but the kind of military involvement that none of us want drawing
buchanan the united states nuclear regulatory commission tomorrow begins an unusual , broadbased review of the performance of the indian point 3 nuclear installation , the first ever at that 17yearold plant , following a series of unfavorable periodic evaluations by the federal agency we are concerned about indian point 3 s performance , said curtis j cowgill , chief of the reactor projects branch , which oversees nuclear plants in the northeast , known as region i the inspection team , led by wayne lanning , deputy director of the division of reactor safety , will evaluate operations , maintenance , engineering , safety assessment and qualityverification procedures during a twoweek visit , mr cowgill said the inspection follows a report by the commission in november that criticized the operations , maintenance , procedures and some of the employees of indian point 3 , which is owned and operated by the new york power authority , the country s largest nonfederal public power agency indian point 2 , owned by consolidated edison , was the subject of an augmented review in 1988 because of an improper water level in a steam generator , said michael j spall , manager of nuclear information for the plant weak management control cited the november report on the state power authority s plant 3 , part of a regular assessment of nuclear plants by the commission , said that performance had declined in five of seven categories the decline was measured against an earlier review , known as the systematic assessment of licensee performance these regular reports are issued every 18 months or so , and many of them have shown a declining trend in performance the november report , mr cowgill said , showed that performance at the plant was clearly not as good as it had been in the previous salp , and he added that the nuclear regulatory commission did not think the licensee had taken enough effective action to turn things around the integrated assessment , which begins tomorrow , will evaluate where they are today , mr cowgill said management control is the major weakness at indian point 3 , mr cowgill said we want the new york power authority to identify their problems and correct weaknesses on their own , he said there have been too many cases where we have been involved too heavily the commission found numerous violations of federal regulations in its november review , which assessed the plant s operations for the previous 15 months penalties for these violations amounted to 462 , 500 last year , the largest amount paid by any of the 31 nuclear plants in region 1 , said diane screnci , a spokeswoman for the federal agency one group of violations , first identified last may , led to conditions adverse to quality , including a poorly maintained system to add chemicals to the reactor water supplying a backup system to control the nuclear reaction , ms screnci said a separate violation led to a potential to overload a 480volt emergency part of the electrical system , which ms screnci said could prevent emergency generators from mitigating the consequences of an accident 'inaccurate information' received other fines were levied for deficiencies in the company s fitnessforduty program , including one case in which an employee who tested positive for marijuana use was allowed to return to work other violations included inaccurate information provided during a regular inspection and a series of leaks in one of the water systems at the plant , which ms screnci said , were n't evaluated and repaired in a timely fashion indian point 3 is one of two nuclear power plants adjacent to each other on the hudson river indian point 1 was built by consolidated edison 30 years ago under the first license granted by the atomic energy commission for commercial production of nuclear power , the first reactor in what is now a nationwide network of 110 nuclear plants indian point 1 was decommissioned 11 years later , but the building remains , its operations replaced by indian point 2 as newer technologies and safety features made the first plant obsolete today , the combined power of the two newer plants supplies new york city and most of westchester with about 29 percent of their electricity the power authority owns a second plant in lycoming , ny , the james a fitzpatrick nuclear power plant , which was fined 500 , 000 last year , with the penalties subsequently reduced to 300 , 000 , ms screnci said the fitzpatrick plant is one of six plants in region 1 on the agency s watch list , a federal designation for plants with declining performance over an extended period of time , ms screnci said workers' attitudes criticized mr cowgill and ms screnci refused to speculate about whether the special team inspection of indian point 3 would cause it to be placed on the list anything is possible , ms screnci said there s no secret that the performance of indian point 3 is not what we would like it to be , said carl f patrick , a spokesman for the new york power authority although the plant was extremely well run , in the past , mr patrick said , now , we 're not running the plant as well as we 'd like he attributed the problems to a lack of management oversight and the attitude of workers
aspen , colo , aug 23 attending the opening of a new concert hall has tended to be dreary business in recent decades understandably , the backers are invariably puffed with civic pride over the glittery , freshsmelling structure , but the sound of the thing is often sorely deficient if not truly dreadful so after arriving here on friday and reading all about the heaven of a hall proclaimed in a banner headline of the aspen times , this interloper slathered on the hype repellent , ingested a stiff dose of critical bile and trudged off to the opening the surprise could hardly have been happier the 500seat joan and irving harris concert hall , designed by the aspen architect harry teague and constructed by the aspen music festival and school at a cost of 7 million , seems a little gem in the making an excellent first impression , at a concert by the aspen chamber symphony on friday evening , was largely borne out by a varied weekend of listening to chamber music , solo piano , large orchestra and jazz performed by some highpowered artists on hand for the occasion among them were pinchas zukerman , misha and cipa dichter , the soprano renee fleming , the jazz guitarist larry coryell and justice harry a blackmun the sound , heard from several seats and even from a standing post in a back corner , was almost uniformly promising to the extent that it is not yet ideal \( for some smaller ensembles it came remarkably close \) , it has builtin potential for improvement the acoustics , like those of the acclaimed meyerson symphony center in dallas , are tunable , here chiefly by means of retractable cloth wall panels no adjustments were made during the weekend elizabeth cohen , a los angeles acoustician who collaborated with mr teague , said that several illfitting panels did not yet slide easily , and that there had not been enough time in 10 days of tuning to train stagehands in their manipulation still , the sound was almost unanimously extolled performers said they could hear one another perfectly and could project easily without forcing audiences seemed thrilled , too , and with good reason the various sonorities of the instruments have good detail yet juicy reverberance , wonderful character , naturalness , fullness and bloom true , an excess of bloom can degenerate into boom , and some highly trained musicians worried about aggressive high strings or recessive low ones , but only a little the hall has an overabundance of the things that are hardest to get , said george tsontakis , a new york composer and conductor who spends his summers in aspen it has a beautiful , lush sound that needs some experimenting , some taming but these are problems that are easy to deal with raymond mase , a trumpeter who performed in the hall as part of the aspen chamber symphony and the american brass quintet , agreed it s great , he said when you 're already at 95 percent before you start improving , you 're doing very well the auditorium is also visually striking its generous wood panels and white concrete ceiling are bathed in soft angles and curves it is spacious for a chamber hall indeed , it seems positively airy , no small feat , since it it is almost entirely underground \( on one communal descent of the three flights to floor level , a wag likened the place to aida s tomb \) situated in aspen meadows , near the festival s 1 , 700seat concert tent , harris hall was designed to fit unobtrusively into its surroundings it protrudes only slightly from a low grassy mound the main facade resembles nothing so much as a service station its most prominent feature is three glasspaneled garagetype doors that slide up under the ceiling the white concrete roof plays off the white top of the tent \( designed by the bauhaus architect herbert bayer in 1964 \) , turning its regular , jagged angles topsyturvy ground was broken late last august , and the hall was built from the top down , so the workers would have a roof over their heads during the winter , one of the worst here in recent history despite some 240 inches of snow , construction was completed on schedule , in 11 months ms cohen , who has worked extensively in hollywood but never on a concert hall , speaks fondly of her rapport with constructionworker poets , who played the structural beams to learn their every sonic trait now musicians are curiously tapping the innards the pianist vladimir feltsman reported that during a rehearsal on sunday morning for his recital in the hall this evening , he rapped on the stage floor and heard a reassuring hollowness underneath they were very smart to use all the wood , he added i love it there are no tricks it is very clear , very clean , very natural the pleasure of hearing the hall throughout the weekend had much to do with the quality of the performances as well in the opening concert , mr zukerman led a delightful series of vivaldi concertos for one , two , three and four violins he played in each , and was joined in the last three by different violin students of dorothy delay , ranging from 12 to 17 years old an astonishing parade
a funny thing happened at the garden the other night two members of the gulfandwesternorwhateverthey 'recallingitthesedayscorporatedancers dashed over to the celebrity seats after one of their aggressive routines that seem choreographed to represent the artificiality of modern urban life anyway , the noted american character actor , arnold schwarzenegger , taking a break from disrupting new york traffic , spotted the dancers coming his way and he got what appeared to be the empty seat next to him and they did one of those cartoon brake jobs , like the roadrunner coming to a dead halt screech ! where s gregory \? they just wanted to make a quick professional salute to their nimble colleague , gregory hines , who was off doing a television interview during a timeout a cute moment , watching arnold s faceoid freeze this is what it feels like when the heavy hitters are in the garden branford marsalis and spike lee and gregory hines and dustin hoffman and ronnie lott and john mcenroe and danny aiello and arnold schwarzenegger , together again talk about your heavyweight fights the national basketball association produces these confrontations with regularity shaq vs patrick full house two vs seven jockeying for playoff position the regular pro season still has a month to run , but these are hardly the dog days in new york alone , the knicks and the nets are still works in progress there is a sense of urgency because every step they take , every move they make , we are watching them this is what i meant the other day when i wrote that i could live with a slightly expanded playoff system in baseball make september more interesting sixteen qualifiers in basketball surely seemed like overkill last year when the nets , who often had trouble rounding up five players willing to take the floor , were able to sneak into the playoffs but it is hard to criticize any system that allows a mature young giant like shaquille o'neal to bang around with patrick ewing on monday night , as a prelude to the playoffs the knicks are currently second in the east and the magic is seventh in the east they could meet , two in new york , two in orlando , and one in new york loser goes home o'neal had given ewing some embarrassing moments in three earlier games , but this time ewing scored a clean knockout , 37 points and 17 rebounds , to o'neal s 23 points and 9 rebounds , as the knicks won in overtime , 109107 pat riley , who rarely permits himself any shading of emotion , said , i'm glad we do n't meet them again until the playoffs , maybe this league is very definitely on a roll who could have envisioned a league without magic and bird having a dozen new plots \? the lakers come to new york tonight and riley was asked if that meant any extra incentive for him none , riley said absolutely none no difference another game it s been three years four years long enough qualifying is the thing keeping the homecourt edge last year the knicks terrorized chicago in the playoffs , but the extra home game was always there on monday , john starks was asked about the emotion of the orlando game , and he said , well , it s not exactly the sixth game against chicago last season , they won that game , at home , but then they were massacred in chicago seventh game home advantage it is why these march games reverberate over in new jersey , the nets have their own incentive plan they are trying to hang onto their extra home game in the first round of the playoffs , which means they must remain among the best four teams in the east they must do it without kenny anderson , the spindly sophomore who has matured into a classic new york guard all year it was whispered that the nets were a viable playoff team as long as kenny anderson stayed healthy now anderson s wrist is broken from a nasty foul by john starks there are those who would exact a biblical punishment , eyeforeye , toothfortooth , but i 've seen the films i think starks rudely meant to stop anderson from getting off a shot , but i do n't think he tried to break anderson s hand i 've seen him do worse what we have here is a regrettable break of the game , another in the long line of whatifs for the new jersey franchise what if larry brown had n't gotten antsy \? what if micheal ray richardson had stayed clean \? what if roy boe had n't sold dr j \? but chuck daly ca n't think of it that way daly must prepare the nets for life without kenny the nets want the extra game in front of their own earthier route 1 holiday inn lounge gogo dancers the homecourt advantage it makes march exciting photo arnold schwarzenegger with shaquille o'neal yesterday \( associated press \)

cologne , germany , jan 14 frank weber has never been able to walk during the 25 years of his young life , but his wheelchair has made him mobile and independent enough that he hardly ever thinks about his handicap in the kaufhof department store near his home here a couple of months ago , three neonazi skinheads brutally reminded him of his condition they must have forgotten you in dachau , one of the youths snarled at him , while the others looked on menacingly none of them were older than 21 what happened next was in marked contrast to the way the silent majority of ordinary germans behaved 60 years ago when the nazis began rounding up jews , communists , gypsies and also handicapped people in concentration camps like dachau two or three other people in the store saw what was happening , and came up and stood between me and the skins , mr weber said these people , also germans , denounced the youths for bullying someone in a wheelchair and told them to get packing fear of being next targets mr weber , who shares an apartment with other handicapped members of club 68 , a group that includes nonhandicapped people , was badly frightened ever since neonazi violence against foreign asylumseekers , gypsies and others began to surge in germany more than a year ago , physically and mentally handicapped people have been saying they were afraid that they would be the next targets , and suddenly he had felt like one but millions of people were taking to the streets of germany to express their revulsion against the attacks against foreigners , carrying candles and forming human chains in cities from munich to hamburg one of mr weber s roommates , stefan fricke , thought of appealing to the people of cologne to take to the streets to show tolerance for the handicapped as well as for foreigners mr fricke , a 30yearold native of bonn , also uses a wheelchair , and when he suggested the idea to fellow members of club 68 , which also runs a kindergarten and a printing shop , they started telephoning and putting up posters all over the city they proposed a chain of lights for tolerance , against prejudice and antisemitism , for a society in which handicapped and nonhandicapped , foreigners and germans live peacefully together the people of the rhineland cathedral city were invited to show up on the bridges that span the river between 6 30 and 7 pm on a recent saturday 50 , 000 turn out more than a score of other groups political parties , workers at the ford factory , students , labor unions joined the appeal , and more than 50 , 000 people turned out with lights and candles on a frigid , rainy , windswept night mr fricke and his friends were overwhelmed and pleased , but they were far from satisfied that the threat , to them or to others , is over the experience of our history shows clearly that every desecration of a jewish grave , every firebomb thrown into a shelter for asylumseekers , every attack against foreigners and handicapped brings further attacks , and endangers everyone s security , a statement by the club said later farright groups committed 2 , 285 acts of violence in germany last year , the vast majority of them against foreign asylumseekers , according to government figures , which did not document attacks against handicapped people it s all got to do with the recession , with growing unemployment , and with the idea that asylumseekers are somehow an economic burden , said klaus kiesenthal , who is handicapped and 66 you hear a lot of talk now about how the handicapped are also a burden from there it s not very far to talk about euthanasia people like mr kiesenthal are not reassured by government appeals for tolerance of foreigners because they are needed for the work that contributes to the economy reducing tolerance to economic selfinterest , they believe , misses the essential moral and ethical point and , they say , the moral climate has become much rawer since the unification of the country two years ago a court in flensburg recently awarded damages to a vacationing german couple who maintained that their holiday had been ruined by the presence of handicapped guests in their hotel attacked , then a suicide last year , national newspapers reported the suicide of gunter schirmer , disabled by a car accident 10 years earlier , after he had been thrown down the stairs at the hanover railroad station by young thugs a few weeks before he took his life , mr schirmer and his wife had been harassed by youths who taunted him , under hitler , people like you would have been gassed long ago his farewell note said he would now destroy the cripple people have become much more materialistic , selfish and perfectionistic , said angelika rosenthal , a nonhandicapped member of club 68 who believes that neonazis are far from the only germans who are intolerant the day before the march here , she said , skinheads beat a young turkish woman senseless in the center of cologne , and nobody stopped them intolerance in germany , she and others realize , is a problem that predated the nazis , and is not likely to be overcome by demonstrations and chains of lights in the space of a few months photo ever since neonazi violence against foreign asylumseekers , gypsies and others began to surge in germany more than a year ago , physically and mentally handicapped people have been saying they are afraid that they will be the next targets stefan fricke , above , organized a candlelight vigil in cologne to show tolerance for the handicapped as well as for foreigners more than 50

you could wear any of those clothes right now , a woman was overheard telling her companion at a preview of versailles 1973 american fashion on the world stage , which opens today at the costume institute of the metropolitan museum of art the woman was right , but that is not the point of the exhibition pegged to the fashion show at the palace of versailles on nov 28 , 1973 , presumably the moment american fashion came of age five upstarts from the provinces to the french , any clothes from outside paris are provincial were invited to show their clothes on the same stage as five lions of french couture to raise money for the versailles restoration fund the contenders from new york were anne klein , who died in 1974 and whose assistant , donna karan , continued the business stephen burrows , who dropped out of the fashion field in the 1980 s but who is back in business at henri bendel , where he started bill blass oscar de la renta , who began designing for the paris couture house of pierre balmain last year while still continuing his company in new york , and halston , who died in 1990 the french couturiers , all of whom are still in business 20 years later , were yves saint laurent , christian dior , hubert de givenchy , emanuel ungaro and pierre cardin it was truly a clash of cultures , with the opponents unevenly matched it was widely recognized as a case in which the good guys finished first , for the americans produced readytowear , which was the wave of the future the french clothes were custommade , a branch of fashion now fighting to stay alive the elaborate backdrops and props of the french contingent contrasted with the bare stage the americans used , dramatized by pools of light each side had its stars josephine baker performed for the french , liza minnelli for the americans little about this fashion war is captured by the show at the metropolitan museum the personalities and the ambiance are restricted to a wall of photographs , where the vitality of mr burrows and his black models , including norma jean darden , alva chinn and pat cleveland , dominate the traditional society figures none of the french clothes can be seen in the current show the 110 styles displayed on the mannequins in the costume institute are designs by the versailles five and others , living and dead , from the new york scene james galanos , who many thought should have been invited to paris , is represented by a dress of gold plaid and black velvet from 1966 there is nothing from geoffey beene , another serious contender 20 years ago who is now considered one of the country s leading designers pauline trigere , who is celebrating her 50th year in business , designed a dinner suit shown in 1950 norman norell , who died the year before the versailles show , is responsible for a sailor dress and a dinner suit , among other styles claire mccardell , credited with designing the best american sportswear , is represented by a number of styles , although she died in 1957 the exhibition , therefore , turns out to have only a tenuous connection to the gala evening to benefit versailles 20 years ago instead , it uses that event as a springboard for four ideas in american fashion , say richard martin , curator of costumes at the costume institute , and harold koda , associate curator in wall labels explaining the show , they describe these themes , starting with sportswear a dress of freedom and expedience their second point is women s apparel that modifies menswear , followed by simplicity , which expresses the american spirit for the plain and pure , even in clothing luxury their fourth point is the accommodation of daywear for evening signifies american pragmatism and informality the language is unnecessarily prolix , but the points are reasonably valid it is not necessary to wade through the prose to recognize the utility of halston s cashmere sweaterdresses , for example , and the charm of his knitted cardigans tied around the hips the labels to the individual styles can provide hurdles of their own his affinity to minimalism is apparent , reads one card about halston his rapport for colorfield painting or postpainterly abstraction , it continues , is suggested in the monochromatic order of his cashmeres of the early 70 s a bit pretentious for beige cashmere separates , no \? the curators' four themes are irrelevant when it comes to the splashy jersey dresses of mr burrows , with their bands of brilliant colors and their inventive cuts brilliance in any field rarely lends itself to catagorizing but the clothes are fun to look at in fact , most of the clothes look fun to wear , and few look irrevocably dated a oneshoulder dress in limegreen suede by bonnie cashin , another sportswear originator a plaid wool shorts suit by mr de la renta , and the long beige dress worn with a fox fur jacket by anne klein herself to the versailles gala are all easy and amusing as a walk through american fashions of the last few decades , the show has its own justification the clothes are light and colorful , and a few are truly amusing some , like a bubbleskirted plaid dress and jacket by rudi gernreich of 1968 , seem misplaced , but a red sweater and long satin skirt by mr blass meets several of the qualifications it is simple and casual , an interpretation of daytime fashion for evening whether a global style emerged from the showing at versailles and whether american fashion has become a global force , as the curators contend , are highly conjectural but the very real accomplishments of american designers are quite evident the clothes do indeed look like styles people can wear versailles 1973 american fashion on the world stage remains at the costume institute of the metropolitan museum of art , fifth avenue at 82d street , through nov 28 it is sponsored by halston enterprises , a subsidiary of halston borghese photos at the metropolitan bill blass s 1992 short dress , and halston s 1973 open back and 1972 cutout sides in black cashmere \( pg c1 \) the beige dress and fox jacket that anne klein wore to the 1973 fashion show at versailles are included in the current exhibition at the costume institute broad bands of color distinguish wool jersey dresses from the early 70 s by stephen burrows , one of five americans who showed their designs at versailles \( photographs by bill cunningham for the new york times \) \( pg c28 \)
secretary of state warren christopher announced yesterday that the united states would provide 250 million over two years to help carry out the israelipalestinian accord and called for an early international conference to more than match the american pledge the 250 million is only a preliminary estimate based on hasty conversations with congress over the weekend , other senior administration officials said the united states is expected to present a more comprehensive fiveyear aid package at the conference , which is tentatively scheduled for oct 1 in washington , they added about 60 percent of the aid will be in grants for public projects in the occupied west bank and gaza strip and the rest in loans and loan guarantees to spur private investment world bank assesses need a world bank study estimates that the palestinians will need a minimum of 300 million a year over the next decade for public projects , a figure that also reflects how much money a nascent palestinian infrastructure can absorb the bank has not estimated how much money will be needed or available for private investment the palestine liberation organization , by contrast , has drawn up a far more ambitious plan that calls for an immediate infusion of 25 billion in aid and 116 billion by the year 2000 the administration is hoping to raise 2 billion at the international conference for the next five years , including the american contribution , in a speech at columbia university yesterday in which he unveiled the administration s strategy for the middle east , mr christopher emphasized the importance of providing money for palestinian projects as soon as possible , both to maintain the momentum of the diplomatic breakthrough last week and to insure that the palestinian experiment with selfrule in the gaza strip and jericho succeeds who will be invited with russia as cosponsor and the world bank handling much of the coordination and aid , mr christopher said , the united states will invite foreign and finance ministers representing europe , japan , canada and the wealthy arab countries of the persian gulf , israeli and palestinian officials , and others , whom he did not name the international community must move immediately to see that the agreement produces tangible improvements in the security and daily lives of palestinians and israelis , mr christopher said in his address , which was jointly sponsored by the school of international and public affairs and the council on foreign relations if peace is to be achieved , the agreement must be translated into results quickly and vividly in particular , mr christopher said , money must be available immediately to curb unemployment that robs families of hope and fuels extremism , build housing and roads and help develop the groundwork for public administration , tax collection and social services 'needs can be met' other officials said the money would also pay for technical help for holding elections , strengthening credit institutions , aiding farmers , organizing food imports and making it easy for foreign investment given the number and commitment of our international partners , we are confident these needs can be met , mr christopher said and we will stimulate these supporters by our own example working with the congress , we expect to assemble an initial twoyear package worth 250 million senior administration officials said they hoped that the world community could deliver at least 100 million to 200 million for showcase projects in the next two to three months at the same time , they cautioned that the palestinians must develop the administrative structures to receive and dispense the aid president clinton will appoint a special coordinator to manage palestinian aid and a task force of jewish and arabamericans to help the administration develop joint projects and private investment , mr christopher said but mr christopher did not say and other officials could not explain why the united states was not being host to a more ambitious global conference that would include economically healthy countries with the ability to contribute aid , like brunei , singapore and korea , as well as poorer countries that over the decades have embraced the palestinian cause and could offer symbolically important contributions the united nations held a largely symbolic global conference of donors in 1986 to raise money to revive devastated african economies , although none of the donor nations made specific commitments on aid and debt relief about 150 million of the 250 million in american aid in the first two years will be in outright grants the remainder will be in loans , loan guarantees and political risk insurance from the overseas private investment corporation , a government agency , to help american businesses invest in gaza and jericho by contrast , the united states gives israel 3 billion and egypt 21 billion a year in aid more than onethird of the entire american foreign aid budget much of this aid is military in lobbying for an ambitious aid package for russia in recent months , the administration was faced with a growing chorus of lawmakers who suggested that israel and egypt might have to sacrifice some of their aid , which has remained fairly constant since the 1979 peace treaty between them but both mr clinton and mr christopher have vowed to maintain aid to israel and egypt at the current levels , and since last week s israelipalestinian agreement , the sentiment on capitol hill is to pour more , rather than less , money into the region
white plains two candidates , jeanine ferris pirro and michael g cherkasky , vying fiercely for the office of district attorney which is being vacated after 25 years by carl a vergari have found no shortage of issues , including the assertion that both have a lot to explain when it comes to campaign contributions mr cherkasky , a leading prosecutor under robert m morgenthau , the manhattan district attorney , said that mrs pirro , when running for county court judge in 1990 , solicited and accepted contributions from individuals and organizations intimately connected with organized crime mrs pirro , a former assistant district attorney and county court judge , said that mr cherkasky , while running mr morgenthau s 1985 reelection campaign , accepted contributions from a union linked to organized crime and a 10 , 000 interestfree loan from the president of a bank prosecuted by the manhattan da s office mr cherkasky asked why would an assistant district attorney , which she was at the time , accept money from companies or unions associated with organized crime , and why did they give it \? were they supporting good government \? contributors' identities unknown mrs pirro s campaign said that the contributions cited as questionable were from a manhattan union local and three businesses , two from the bronx and one from new jersey , all outside the jurisdiction of westchester county in any case , the statement continued , mrs pirro had set up a finance committee for her 1990 race and did not solicit contributions , nor was she aware of the identity of her campaign contributions the pirro camp also said that the contributors whose motives were questioned by mr cherkasky gave to the campaigns of such fellow democrats as gov mario m cuomo , mayor david n dinkins , senator diane feinstein of california and assemblyman richard l brodsky , who is running for westchester s county executive as for the charge that mr cherkasky accepted tainted contributions on behalf of mr morgenthau , the manhattan district attorney has said that he did not know of the allegations against the union at the time and , in any case , mr cherkasky s tasks in the 1985 race did not include fundraising 'antinew york city xenophobia' mrs pirro , meanwhile , has sought to portray her opponent as an outsider who does not understand the westchester criminaljustice system because he has had no experience here mr cherkasky , who has lived in larchmont for seven years , was born in white plains his entire experience as a prosecutor has been in manhattan mrs pirro said i have been a prosecutor and judge in this county for almost 20 years for 15 years i was an assistant district attorney , and thereafter i was elected the first female county court judge in the history of this county she added that as an assistant district attorney her conviction rate was 100 percent and that none of the convictions had been overturned on appeal she said mr cherkasky made a name for himself grabbing headline cases in new york city while her work in the county has been representing the weak and defenseless women , children and the elderly mr cherkasky said that the same law applies in manhattan and westchester seconddegree murder is seconddegree murder in both jurisdictions as for his opponent s winning 100 percent of her cases , he said , she must have been very selective in picking cases to prosecute because domestic violence cases are the most difficult to win mr cherkasky , who only recently registered as a democrat , saying he wanted to avoid any conflictofinterest charges as a prosecutor , defended his experience in manhattan i am coming from the best da s office in the nation , something that should be a credential , not a deterrent , he said the kind of antinew york city xenophobia that mrs pirro talks about has a very narrow appeal , and it does n't work from horizontal to vertical system mr cherkasky s credentials are , in fact , vastly different from mrs pirro s as chief of the investigations division of the manhattan district attorney s office , he supervised 75 lawyers and 150 investigators my budget was 14 million , he said the entire budget for the westchester da is 12 million mrs pirro s experience as a prosecutor is limited to the domestic violence and child abuse bureau , which she founded , one of the first such prosecutors in the country she was also the first woman to try a murder case in westchester as the result of a case that originated in the domestic violence and child abuse bureau and was the first woman elected to the county court bench both candidates have indicated that they will make changes in the office they are seeking in some cases , the modifications are similar they would go from a horizontal to a vertical system of prosecution , using one assistant district attorney from beginning to end as mr cherkasky explained it , under the horizontal process , one assistant does local criminal court and hearings , another handles grand jury presentations , a third does plea bargains and a fourth handles motions
washington , march 20 a generation after the united states responded to poisoned streams and filthy air with the world s first comprehensive strategy to protect the environment , many scientists , economists and government officials have reached the dismaying conclusion that much of america s environmental program has gone seriously awry these experts say that in the last 15 years environmental policy has too often evolved largely in reaction to popular panics , not in response to sound scientific analyses of which environmental hazards present the greatest risks as a result , many scientists and public health specialists say , billions of dollars are wasted each year in battling problems that are no longer considered especially dangerous , leaving little money for others that cause far more harm at first , clear benefits in the first wave of the modern environmental movement , starting about 30 years ago , the focus was on broad efforts to eliminate the most visible pollution pouring from smokestacks and sewer pipes programs with clear goals that had obvious benefits but a second wave began in the late 1970 s , with a new strategy intended to limit visible pollution further and to begin attacking invisible threats from toxic substances to that end , states and the federal government began writing sweeping environmental laws , some of which included strict regulations to insure that certain toxic compounds were not present in air , water or the ground at levels that did not exceed a few parts per billion , concentrations that could be measured with only the most sophisticated equipment the result was a tangle of regulations that the environmental protection agency estimates cost more than 140 billion a year , roughly 100 billion spent by industry and 40 billion by government but what is now becoming apparent , some scientists and public health specialists say , is that some of these laws written in reaction to popular concerns about toxic waste dumps or asbestos in the schools , as examples were based on little if any sound research about the true nature of the threat since 1980 , for instance , thousands of regulations were written to restrict compounds that had caused cancer in rats or mice , even though these animal studies often fail to predict how the compounds might affect humans and with rare exceptions , congress approved new laws without subjecting them to even rudimentary costbenefit analyses one reason was that during the 1980 s , when the economy seemed healthier , there was far less pressure on congress to consider the cost of environmental policy overpriced and misguided \? now a new administration intent on strengthening environmental policy is settling into office when competition for scarce financial resources is keen at the same time , a wealth of new research shows that some of the nation s environmental protection efforts are excessively costly though no one knows how much of this money is misspent and devoted to the wrong problems this view is the vanguard of a new , third wave of environmentalism that is sweeping across america it began in the late 1980 s among farmers , homeowners and others who were upset largely by the growing cost of regulations that did n't appear to bring any measurable benefits corporate executives had long been making similar arguments but had gone unheeded , even during 12 years of republican rule , because often they were seen as interested only in saving money richard j mahoney , chairman and chief executive of monsanto , the chemical company , said the nation may start listening to industry now people want to know , even with the environment , what we are getting for our money , he said the most positive thing since the election is that we are beginning to recognize that we do have finite resources , and one must make choices but leaders of the nation s conservation organizations believe the new view is misguided we do n't need a new paradigm , said david d doniger , a senior lawyer with the natural resources defense council for 35 years , the policy of the government has been that when there is uncertainty about a threat it is better to be safe than sorry when you are operating at the limits of what science knows , the big mistake would be to underestimate the real danger and leave people unprotected still , in the last few years the wave has moved into universities , city halls , state capitols and even to the highest levels of the epa , whose science advisory board in 1990 concluded that environmental laws are more reflective of public perceptions of risk than of scientific understanding of risk law follows panic william k reilly , the epa administrator at the time , agreed and in a recent interview , he argued people have a right to expect that public officials are making the right choices for the right reasons we need to develop a new system for taking action on the environment that is n't based on responding to the nightly news we 're misallocating large amounts of money , added mr reilly , who is now a senior fellow at of the world wildlife fund what we have had in the united states is environmental agendasetting by episodic panic we 've had love canal , valley of the drums , the exxon valdez and with virtually every case of a new environmental crisis , there is a new legislative priority and a new budget allocation that has created a mix of programs that do n't respect the biggest risks to health and ecology
washington , march 25 a top white house official during the bush administration intervened in a government investigation of neil bush , the president s son , according to l william seidman , former chairman of the federal deposit insurance corporation here was a neat little story for some investigative reporter , and i could even write the headline 'white house tries to influence neil bush case , ' mr seidman wrote in a forthcoming book , full faith and credit the great s l debacle and other washington sagas , to be published by times books neil bush was investigated by the office of thrift supervision on charges of conflict of interest stemming from his role as a director of the denverbased silverado banking , savings and loan association mr seidman wrote that in late 1990 alfred j t byrne , the fdic s general counsel , came to his office and said that boyden gray , the white house counsel , has a question about the neil bush matter at the time of the investigation , neil bush was also facing a 200 million lawsuit filed by the fdic against him and the other silverado directors boyden wanted to know if there was any legal process to move the neil bush case out of the administrative process and into a federal court , mr seidman wrote i told him it was a matter to stay out of , a loser , and none of our business mr byrne disregarded the advice on jan 2 , my first day back in the office after the holidays , tim ryan informed me that al had called him about neil bush , and the possible change of venue , mr seidman wrote mr ryan was the director of the office of thrift supervision some punishment given mr ryan referred the matter to the treasury department s inspector general , according to mr seidman , who added in a telephone interview today from milwaukee that subsequently byrne was reprimanded by our board , on the recommendation of the treasury s inspector general , and lost his bonus and salary increase mr seidman categorized that punishment as a rap across the knuckles the justice department also investigated , he wrote , and decided it had insufficient evidence to prosecute a justice department spokesman said today that the department did look into the situation and decided to take no action mr byrne declined to discuss the matter mr gray , now a lawyer with the washington law firm of wilmer , cutler pickering , was on vacation today , and could not be reached for comment however , he told the washington post , which reported mr seidman s disclosures today , that he was simply seeking information and had no intention of intervening in the case it is a political axiom , however , that a president , governor , mayor or any official can signal an interest in a case , thereby affecting its outcome , just by requesting a status report' mr seidman said there was no evidence that mr gray had acted on president george bush s behalf

in struggling neighborhoods from the northeast bronx to southeast queens , a new sort of political warlord is walking the ground that once belonged to the powerful democratic county bosses in new york city and none is more successful than a brooklyn assemblyman who is scarcely known outside political circles or his own dilapidated bushwick neighborhood vito j lopez over 17 years of near obscurity , mr lopez has built the prototype of the modern innercity political machine , one capable of generating thousands of votes and armies of volunteers , largely by exploiting its links to a socialservice organization that mr lopez founded and that is now the largest employer and economic enterprise in his neighborhood the machine is potent enough to induce pilgrimages from mayors , senators and , last year , a presidential candidate named bill clinton , who arrived in a 15car motorcade during last year s new york primary campaign the organization , the ridgewood bushwick senior citizens council , employs 1 , 400 people through more than 50 grants budgeted at more than 33 million annually yet at the same time many of those taxpayer dollars allocated for pressing human needs have been put to work for private , political purposes as well they have paid for an agglomeration of power that has stunted the neighborhood s political diversity , rewarded a handful of mr lopez s proteges with wellpaying jobs , enriched politically connected contractors and produced programs that in several instances have been criticized for accounting and performance like the socialservice groups connected to representative floyd h flake in queens , assemblyman albert vann in bedfordstuyvesant and pedro espada in the soundview section of the bronx , the ridgewood bushwick council has managed to fill the vacuum left by the dimming influence of county political bosses and the decadelong decline in federal antipoverty money the strongest of the organizations have been able to wrest money from increasingly tightfisted government agencies while several investigations and audits have found nothing illegal in the activities of ridgewood bushwick or mr lopez , a look at the agency illustrates the conflicts between governmental and political interests and raises questions about whether wellmeaning programs are hurt each day , the council cares for 900 homebound people , provides lunch for more than 600 elderly people and houses several hundred people in 20 million worth of governmentsubsidized apartments operating far beyond the orb of the standard program for the aged , it counsels tenant organizations , provides legal help in housing court , markets private houses , runs youth employment and immigrant rights programs and arranges for people to go to college in ridgewood bushwicksponsored programs while operating predominantly in bushwick , it also offers programs in ridgewood and glendale in queens and east new york in brooklyn but politics infuses it from top to bottom ridgewood bushwick s executive director and deputy director serve as a chief fundraiser and treasurer of mr lopez s political campaigns the ridgewood bushwick official who has run its immigrant assistance program is the coleader of mr lopez s political club ridgewood bushwick employees and contractors are asked to pour time and money into mr lopez s races and those of his allies and his political supporters help the organization secure lucrative grants and then reap political iou s making this more extraordinary is the ethnic disparity between mr lopez and the four top ridgewood bushwick officials on one hand , who are white , and bushwick s population , which is 95 percent black and hispanic the assemblyman , who speaks limited spanish , owes his surname to a paternal grandfather from outside barcelona in an interview , mr lopez described the links between ridgewood bushwick and his political endeavors as fundamental to building neighborhood influence in a politically anemic community he took pride in his political empire , berated detractors , and defended ridgewood bushwick s performance and his commitment to hispanic causes the top social service centers in bushwick are run by fegs , catholic charities , nyu in bushwick high school , the grand street settlement , he said they 're all from the outside there has to be an empowerment of local groups once you do it , it s called politics , but i'm proud of it , i really am finding bushwick on the political map when he arrived in bushwick as a civil servant in the city s human resources administration in the early 1970 s , mr lopez was in his words , wearing flowered shirts and into anything but politics the son of a wire service photographer , he grew up seven miles away in bensonhurst , had organized antiwar demonstrations , and did n't know where bushwick was when he was sent to stanhope street to convert an empty welfare office to a senior center of predominantly italian heritage , he found a constituency in the italian clubs and cafes that still dotted the increasingly hispanic neighborhood he built the center s staff and programs by convincing local organizations to lend him 10 workers apportioned under a federal jobs program

leni riefenstahl a memoir by leni riefenstahl illustrated 669 pp new york st martin s press 35 let s get the hoary questions out of the way was leni riefenstahl hitler s lover \? no was she a nazi \? in the strict sense , no otherwise , the americans , the french and , finally , the germans would not have eventually cleared her was she an asset to the nazi cause \? yes what she also is , certainly , is one of the supreme artists of the cinema , the greatest woman film maker ever and her 669page autobiography , leni riefenstahl a memoir , does not contain a single unspellbinding page some books are merely so exciting that you ca n't put them down this one is so exciting that you often must put it down , lest you overdose on thrills riefenstahl tells her story in a clean , welllighted prose , interrupted by occasional purple passages , with here and there an intensely personal touch to remind us that this is a memoir , not just a set of memos \( the uncredited translation is fluent and generally satisfactory , but does not avoid some common errors \) how truthful is it \? how does one assess the veracity of any memoir \? behind hitler s wellguarded doors , or in the remote hills of the sudan , whose corroborating voice can we expect \? save for the flourishes with which an elderly autobiographer \( this aug 22 she turned 91 \) may bedeck some of her choice memories , this strikes me as a credible account of an extraordinary life out of which three or four more than sufficiently eventful ones could be fashioned it s something like a 90year hurdle race the book must , in the main , be true it is far too weird for fiction still , says the captious reader of this review , was n't she a screenwriter , too \? could n't this be a scenario posing as a memoir \? as a screenwriter , riefenstahl was more manichaean hers was a passionately blackandwhite world shot in bold blacks and whites a vision of extremes at one with the deep romanticism of 19thcentury german culture in this memoir , there are colors and shades the skies are troublingly changeable the characters more lifelike than movieish i defy the most skeptical , even hostile , reader to emerge from a reading unaffected part of the way riefenstahl works on a reader s sympathies is by casting herself as both the master of her fate and its victim , a woman who knew what she wanted , had seemingly insurmountable obstacles thrown in her path and overcame them her first impediment was her father born into a middleclass berlin family in 1902 , a scrawny baby who improved with age , young leni excelled at sports , studied painting , dreamed of becoming an actress , then a dancer but papa considered performing a oneway avenue to hell under strict supervision she was not allowed to date or even to go to the movies alone until she was 21 she had to become a bit devious it was a lesson that served her throughout her life if papa threatened to beat you and lock you in your room , plead your case with mutti if italian customs inspectors were officious , wire il duce goebbels stood in your way \? go to hitler for support if hitler said no but we 'll come to that while taking dancing lessons on the sly , leni turned down the occasional movie offer so as not to blow her cover but doing so hurt as much as her father s beatings or watching him browbeat her mother the girl vowed to become and remain independent nothing daunted her seemingly too old at 23 to start ballet , she nevertheless worked hard enough to succeed at it she also won second prize in a beauty contest , setting another lifelong pattern she s not ashamed , later , when her beloved film the blue light takes only a second in an international contest , or when she comes in second in a major ski race and some of her greatest loves rejected her for other women well before avis , our secondprize winner only tries harder and succeeds , or at least gets to meet the right people before she was 25 , she tells us , ferruccio busoni composed a piece for her and predicted success as a dancer the playwright karl vollmoeller tried to seduce her and prophesied failure without a sugar daddy otto froitzheim , a german tennis ace , stared at her in the locker room and later , with a power play , netted her virginity men generally fell at her feet , she says are we to believe all this \? the evidence is not unpersuasive the great mary wigman , who taught only the best , put the final polish on leni s dancing she appeared in max reinhardt s deutsches theater and danced triumphantly in a huge prague theater where only pavlova had preceded her the fuel she drove on was obsession admirable or misguided , it subsumed all her strivings as a dancer , as an actress , as a mountaineer and skier and later as but we 'll come to that , too obsession rescued her when a cracked kneecap threatened to end her dancing career waiting in the berlin subway for a train to take her to a doctor , she spotted a poster 'mountain of destiny' a film about the dolomites by dr arnold fanck instead of the physician , she saw the movie enthralled , she set about becoming an actress luis trenker , the leading mountainmovie star , patronizingly discouraged her on her way to one of her periodic stays in the hospital for the ill health that plagued her throughout her life , she sent pictures and a letter to fanck soon he was at her bedside with the holy mountain , a script dedicated to her
as the economy softens , interest heightens in warehouse purchasing clubs , which sell household goods and food products at wholesale prices to members this friday , pace , the first membership warehouse in westchester , is scheduled to open for business in elmsford we already have 3 , 000 business members and 1 , 000 household members signed up , said greg mowery , the director of the pace warehouse , which is at 333 saw mill river road , route 9a the yearly membership fee for those joining the warehouse club before the opening is 25 , he said , while those joining after the opening will pay 30 a year the attraction price business members , who make up 60 percent of the membership , are likely to be the owners of small retail stores , doctors , dentists and entrepreneurs , mr mowery said he said they would be able to buy merchandise for business resale and personal needs at the special hours of 9 am to 11 am daily a local merchant , such as a momandpop deli , is a typical business member , he said the attraction is price our wholesale price makes it easy on their pocketbooks because they are able to buy smaller quantities of products for resale than are available from other sources an example a dozen pounds of shortening can be had at the same wholesale price that they 'd pay for a carload of the stuff elsewhere individual householders who are club members can buy even smaller quantities , he said , like a package of two heads of lettuce or a package of three us choice steaks what else is available \? everything from fresh foods to fax machines , with brandname items in over 250 product categories , douglas hock , a pace spokesman , said we have extremely low markups because our profits are derived almost entirely from membership fees , not markups on merchandise , he said we work on a markup of 8 to 9 percent compared with 25 percent markup for discounters and 40 percent for retailers an untapped market the cost of doing business in westchester , together with the lack of available sites to build a warehouse , slowed the growth of warehouse clubs in the county , mr hock said but now , he said , with the recession and the economy in the doldrums , we feel the environment is right westchester , with its population density , is a huge untapped market the demographics are good we expect to generate 45 million in sales pace , with headquarters in englewood , colo , operates 125 warehouses in 29 states and puerto rico the company , which was founded in 1983 , was acquired by kmart corporation in 1989 and operates as a wholly owned subsidiary studies of the westchester market began several years ago when pace was approached by martin s berger , president of the robert martin company , a major developer in elmsford we had what we thought was a prime location for a warehouse club building , which was 13 acres of land on route 9a in elmsford , mr berger said the site was the old elmsford drivein theater , which had been vacant for 14 years and was a real eyesore , he said one union objects pace , which is a regionally diverse warehouse club with stores as spread out as alaska and puerto rico , was looking at new markets and we thought the demand for warehouse clubs was strong here so it would be a good fit , mr berger said negotiations began between robert martin , pace representatives and the town of greenburgh the only hostility came from a union in queens that represents supermarket employees , mr berger recalled they sent people to attend every hearing but almost everyone else town of greenburgh officials , construction unions , people in the neighborhood were in favor of the project building the 110 , 000squarefoot warehouse building , which is the size of two large supermarkets , created more than 150 construction jobs , he said and that was at a time when construction in the county was absolutely flat the development will bring other substantial benefits to the area , mr berger said , including revenues of approximately 250 , 000 a year in taxes and 150 westchesterites will find new jobs at pace , he said people will have the opportunity to buy what they need at lower prices and what s more , improvement of the property , which has been an eyesore for years , will upgrade the 9a corridor and generate additional activity for local businesses when asked about the new competition local supermarkets will face , mr berger said he did not think a warehouse club would put supermarkets out of business unlike the supermarkets , warehouse clubs stock only 50 percent of food products , he said people do n't go to a warehouse club for a quart of milk they go to stock up on such things as paper goods the economic downturn has spurred the growth of warehouse clubs nationally , mr hock said our operation is based on the premise that today especially , more people are looking for the best bang for the buck , plus the convenience of onestop shopping , he said we 're the fourthlargest warehouse club company in the industry and our size gives us the ability to offer consumers about 4 , 000 items in 250 different product categories of merchandise under one roof we sell bakery goods , but we also sell electronic equipment and automotive supplies and we keep our overhead low and we do n't do any mass media advertising , so we pass the savings on to members pace , he said , is able to buy namebrand products in large quantities directly from manufacturers in addition , the company carries some products under its own label the merchandise in the warehouse stores is geared to the business needs and way of life of the communities they serve , mr mowery said what s popular in alaska would bomb in puerto rico each warehouse carries a line of local products , which include ethnic and gourmet preferences other services are available to members , including optical departments , mailorder pharmacies , a film developingprocess service , and discounted longdistance telephone service from mci pace members did 3 million of business with mci in the first quarter of the year , mr mowery said paul j feiner , supervisor of the town of greenburgh , said that the pace warehouse will not only generate revenue for the town of greenburgh but will also give consumers an alternative shopping choice there was some supermarket opposition but none of the supermarkets mounted a major campaign against the warehouse , mr feiner said in tough times , warehouses offer a way to help people save money , and that s a good thing photos greg mowery , below ,

jersey city as a spectacle , printed letters , at the jersey city museum , is elegant to the point of stylishness and no wonder , for it is the work of a designer , j abbott miller , who is cofounder of design writing research this manhattan company counts among its achievements a recent massachusetts institute of technology show titled the process of elimination the bathroom , the kitchen and the esthetics of waste and is currently engaged in designing a graphic identity for the american center , a new building by frank gehry , in paris but as an exhibition or even a story \( the subtitle is the natural history of typography \) , it is a mystery to be approached with circumspection and , ideally , a mind well primed with the arcana of semiotics the display begins on a landing with old type cases agnes martinstyle grids in weathered wood that are hung on a wall painted terracotta pink after that comes the main gallery , where the walls are violetblue and the objects books , type and printers' tools interspersed with skulls , seashells and the occasional plant are all laid under glass on tables that also have compartments where walls and ceiling merge , conforming to the building s mansarded exterior , are painted , in romanstyle lettering , blue on white , definitions of typography while the installation includes potted palms and cases of stuffed animals , like the one reproduced on this page , it harks back to the galleryparlor recreated some years ago for the newark museum s 19thcentury collection by its curator , the late gary reynolds this , together with the wallsized blowup of a lithograph depicting the headquarters of american type founders , the jersey city company whose centennial the show celebrates , suggests that enlightenment about typography is just around the corner and also , perhaps , the art that goes into it no such luck as explained in what passes for a catalogue , rather than recounting the genre s history from beginning to end as a form of thought with a particular life span , the production aims to show how natural history represents a set of initiatives which have been differently reflected over time this means that the visitor , having been lulled into receptivity by the edwardiana , must now shift gears in order to figure out the meaning of something without knowing what the something is when it comes to the natural history part , the catalogue essay , titled a natural history of natural history and written by julia reinhardt lupton , offers little help beyond explaining that systems for organizing knowledge originated in that devised for categorizing the natural world and unfortunately , this serves only to further the confusion , since the show is more about appearances than content or the relationship between the two in the essay written by mr miller and his partner , ellen lupton , there is some discussion of type anatomy , but it takes place under the heading structuralist typography and is littered with terms like signifier and signified it also abounds in allusions to the darwin of linguistics , ferdinand de saussure , who destroyed the ordinary assumption that language exists to represent ideas if there are any doubts that typography is today losing its function , they should be erased by the label for the book legibility a typographic book of etiquette \( 1949 \) , which states that experimental design today intentionally violates traditional standards of legibility , which anyway is largely considered to be a function of habit that is useful to know , since it may account for the widespread use , particularly in exhibition catalogues , of sansserif faces that are almost impossible to read without moving the lips on the credit side are interesting contrasts like that between the title pages for the history of godefrey of boloyne and the conquest of iherusalem , put out by the kelmscott press in 1893 , and madonna s sex , published by warner books last year the first conveys its message while at the same time gratifying the eye with ornament reflecting william morris s passion for gothic the second is a blurred mass of overlapping letters printed letters , along with its uncatalogue , is a fine advertisement for design writing research , and its chic is guaranteed to arouse anxiety in those who , like the reviewer , are behind in their structuralism but it leaves the onlooker none the wiser as to the craft and art of typography the exhibition remains on view through march 13 the museum is on the fourth floor of the public library at the corner of jersey avenue and montgomery street its hours are 10 30 am to 5 pm tuesday through saturday and 10 30 am to 8 pm wednesday photos head \( orange \) , left , an acrylic on paper by vincent pepi , and an untitled work in felttip pen and pencil by charles seliger \( photographs from the jane voorhees zimmerli art museum \)
toronto , feb 3 it was n't very pretty and it sure was n't exciting it was n't much more than 2 points in the standings for the islanders and they will take them , thank you very much , and take a few days off for the allstar break they outdroned the maple leafs , 32 , tonight at maple leaf gardens as benoit hogue scored two goals to increase his total to 24 for the season and 99 for his national hockey league career the ice was really slow and it was really hot and there was no air to breathe , said hogue the maple leafs , hogue said , do n't give an opponent much room to skate , so you just have to be patient and wait for the rare opportunity goalie on a hot streak the maple leafs outhit and outshot the islanders , who were most grateful to mark fitzpatrick , their goalie , who stopped 26 shots , including one by dave andreychuk with 64 seconds remaining when it looked like he was about to tie the game andreychuk , in his first game with toronto , had scored with 3 minutes 13 seconds left to cut the lead to 32 and it gave the finish a certain tension and excitement that the rest of the evening lacked in the final minute , with felix potvin pulled from the toronto net for an extra attacker , andreychuk took a pass from doug gilmour and shot again , this time from the slot fitzpatrick stopped the puck beneath his pads , although the goalie was looking all around the crease as the whistle blew it was andreychuk s sixth shot on goal for the night it was bouncing around like a pinball , said fitzpatrick , who is 602 in his last eight starts it hit off my glove and bounced down in my pads the islanders , who are 722 in their last 11 games , have moved up to fourth place , 2 points ahead of the fifthplace devils , 1 point behind the thirdplace rangers and only 2 points behind secondplace washington al arbour , the coach , called tonight s victory one of those games you 've got to gut out they do n't give you a lot of room , he said you 've got to battle for every inch we lost a few battles but we won the war it s a gutcheck type of game it s not pretty it s not fancy the leafs led by 10 after one period , but the islanders led by 21 after two andreychuk , who now has 30 goals for the season , was acquired tuesday from buffalo in a trade that also sent goalie daren puppa and a firstround draft choice to the leafs and sent grant fuhr to the sabres dave mcllwain , who lists the islanders among his former teams , opened the scoring for the leafs at 13 26 on a rebound hogue s first , at 3 47 of the second , tied it at 11 he streaked up the right side , faked a shot , faked a pass and then whipped a wrist shot between the skates of potvin foolled by changeup hogue got his second at 15 44 on another rush with patrick flatley and brian mullen when flatley s pass came from left to right , hogue took a slap shot , but connected only partially potvin seemed to misjudge the reduced speed of he shot steve thomas scored at 3 29 of the third period , his 21st of the season , after derek king set him up with a steal and a backhanded pass from the right side there was plenty of holding and hooking and interference , but referee terry gregson did n't seem to mind , calling only three minors in the first period , none in the second and four in the third slap shots don maloney , the firstyear general manager of the islanders , said today that he has sent a formal letter of protest to the national hockey league about the officiating of referee don koharski in monday s 44 tie between the islanders and the rangers the islanders are upset that two of their apparent goals were disallowed while one ranger goal was scored with too many rangers on the ice we 're just voicing our concerns and putting the league on notice that we were n't happy with the way the officiating went , maloney said it s water under the bridge hopefully , we 'll get some sort of response from them
florence , june 14 the white walls are now bare and cracked , and where a window once was is a gaping space , 10 feet high and nearly as wide the room in the uffizi gallery , formerly hung with paintings by the italian 16thcentury master dosso dossi , looks directly over the narrow street on which a car bomb exploded one night late last month through that enormous opening in the wall , the view is breathtaking and horrific set against the backdrop of the soft tuscan hills and the great dome that brunelleschi designed for the cathedral are the shattered red tile roofs of the buildings across the street from the uffizi and the crumbled shell of an adjacent tower , in which a family killed in the explosion used to live a few household belongings can still be seen on what remains of the tower s top floor , reduced to barely more than a roofless platform historic agricultural archives housed in the tower were destroyed if it were n't for the backdrop , the whole scene would bring to mind sarajevo instead of florence and yet the story of the aftermath of the uffizi bombing is a surprisingly encouraging one , with at least part of the museum to reopen on sunday it may even turn out that the disaster will finally galvanize support for freeing italy s preeminent repository of art from the stranglehold of the italian government s cultural bureaucracy , which has long burdened the museum , delaying yearsold expansion plans and forcing it to compete with every small church and provincial museum in the area for operating money little damage beyond repair in the event , although dozens of works suffered scrapes and cuts and three valued paintings were destroyed , only three pictures of the very first rank , sebastiano del piombo s death of adonis , which hung in the room next to the dossos , and rubens s gigantic henry iv at the battle of ivry and entry of henry iv into paris , were seriously cut by the hailstorm of flying glass even those cuts are not beyond repair a major rogier van der weyden that was temporarily in storage survived with only a few minor nicks and unbelievably , not only are the dossos fine , but none of the titians or raphaels or veroneses or caravaggios or the michelangelo that hung in the rooms nearest the bomb were damaged many of these paintings were saved by panels of shatterproof glass installed to deter vandalism one of the curious byproducts of the bombing is that in these last few days the unharmed botticelli gallery has become the single greatest room of art in the world it is there that most of the paintings from the damaged rooms have been temporarily stored , the botticellis on the walls joined by dozens of titians , raphaels , rosso fiorentinos , ghirlandaios and rubenses on the floor the rooms in the western half of the uffizi that were damaged by the bomb will be closed indefinitely but the other half of the museum , which houses the beloved collections of piero della francescas and botticellis and leonardos , are to reopen this weekend \( admission will be free on sunday \) a group of prized works by michelangelo , rembrandt , raphael , titian and caravaggio from the western rooms will also be exhibited temporarily in a ground floor gallery just beyond the andrea del castagno frescoes confused with construction considering that the borghese gallery in rome has been undergoing renovation for years , with no end in sight , the rapid recovery of at least one part of the uffizi is an astonishing event in italy the museum s small staff , several of whose members wept at the first sight of the damage , have labored virtually around the clock to restore order to wander the galleries now is to get the sense of a place under control , with staff members calmly , happily chatting in hallways that just days earlier were so littered with plaster and broken glass that every footstep sounded with a crunch construction on an elaborate new glassenclosed exit from the uffizi onto the piazza castellani began months ago but was not finished tourists , curious about the bombing , can be seen these days peering at the construction site , clearly mistaking it for the bomb site , which is all the way on the other side of the museum and closed off from public view by police barricades a few rubberneckers are always to be found now milling around the museum but a vast majority of tourists who pass through the crowded piazza della signoria , next to the uffizi , seem to take no notice , smiling for snapshots , as tourists long have , in front of the replica of michelangelo s david outside the palazzo vecchio \( which also had windows broken by the explosion \) life has apparently returned almost to normal even on the chiasso dei baroncelli , which leads from the piazza , behind the uffizi , toward the bomb site it s still not clear to the police who is responsible for the bombing or even whether the museum was the target \( the car was not parked in the courtyard of the uffizi , as it might have been \) only one side of the ushaped museum was rocked by the blast , the force of which reverberated in the narrow street and ripped through dozens of the uffizi s windows and skylights , most but not all of which have since been covered by plastic sheets that inadequately shield the galleries against the rain bits of stucco decoration tumbled from the ornate barrelvaulted roof of the room in which the ancient sculpture the dying niobe was damaged another ancient sculpture , the discus thrower , was decapitated and had one hand sheared off by a flying door they can be repaired waiting for a miracle
he went into the yankee clubhouse at the close of the fourth inning , let the door slam behind him with a thump of disgust bob wickman did not want to watch the rest of this ball game , did not want to stare up at the yankee stadium scoreboard at those awful five runs he had given the red sox his team had none and boston had five , and wickman figured it was near to hopeless he figured he was due deservedly due his first loss of the year little did he know what his teammates had in store it started on the very first pitch in the bottom of the fifth , a pitch that boston s frank viola delivered to mike stanley , and stanley delivered to the rightfield seats it ended when dion james , a pinch hitter , spiraled a ball high into short left , then watched it drop into mike greenwell s mitt two out but no problems in between , 11 other new york batters strode to the plate even with two outs , the scoring went on , boston pitcher after boston pitcher getting battered , yankee after yankee reaching base when it was over , when jose melendez relief pitcher no 3 walked to the red sox dugout , the yankees had erased any chance of a bob wickman loss and , four innings later , after brilliant performances by bernie williams and steve farr , new york had a remarkable 97 victory the fiverun comeback was the yankees' biggest of the season , and it put them nine games over 500 with victories in five of their last six they came back out of nowhere , wickman said after neal heaton got out of that inning , i shook his hand and went to the locker room i did n't want to watch anymore it s just hard to express what i'm feeling right now forgive wickman for his loss of words after such a dramatic evening the numbers from that one inning alone were enough to silence anyone six hits eight runs ten baserunners three walks , two that walked in runs one error four pitchers five mound visits seven standing ovations and , of course , 13 men at the plate of the eight runs , all but the one from stanley s solo homer were scored with two outs already in place that guy s living right , spike owen said , nodding in wickman s direction he s a battler out there , and unfortunately he did n't have his usual stuff tonight but there s just something about us coming back for him it s a great feeling going out there with him on the mound unbeatable bob is 70 this season , with an average of 7 new york runs scored in his support in his five previous nodecision outings , the yankees overcame deficits ranging from one to three runs to spare him the loss when wickman left the game with a fiverun deficit , though , manager buck showalter was not depending upon or even thinking about wickman s seemingly remarkable influence on the club and when the 12th yankee batter went to the plate in the bottom of fifth , scoring the eighth run of that inning , he was not thinking about relief 'we need some more runs' i was thinking that we need some more runs , showalter said it was 85 , but the way the game was going , i did n't think it would be enough it almost was n't but , after the fifth , things seemed destined to go the yankees' way williams made a oneout catch in way , way , way left center field a brilliant catch that robbed boston of two runs , and he homered in the bottom of the eighth to provide new york with an insurance run farr , meanwhile , came on with no outs and bases loaded in the top of the eighth and got out of the inning with only two boston runs scored he finished the eighth with a masterful strikeout of mike greenwell and finished the ninth with his 16th save of the year it does n't get much better than that , owen said , of the greenwellfarr confrontation then again this ball game it just does n't get much better than that inside pitch boston took a 40 lead in the first after scott cooper smashed a threerun homer red sox manager butch hobson was ejected after arguing a call in the third inning hobson was furious when umpire john shulock ruled that cooper was guilty of offensive interference when he tried to break up a double play by sliding into spike owen at second base the yankees activated danny tartabull before the game , and he served as the designated hitter to make room for danny tartabull on the roster , the yankees optioned infielder andy stankiewicz to class aaa columbus before last night s game mike witt is scheduled to come off the disabled list tomorrow and start against the minnesota twins witt has been out two weeks because of a sore elbow as long as the blister on his thumb is no longer a hindrance , jim

late on the night of jan 13 , in the governor s mansion in little rock , ark , harold mcewen ickes had a painful conversation with a friend he had known since they protested the vietnam war together they should have been exultant , since mr ickes had just spent more than a year helping to make that friend president of the united states for weeks , bill clinton s team had made no secret that mr ickes , a liberal new york labor lawyer who had lent his tactical canny to a string of losing presidential campaigns , was the leading choice to be deputy chief of staff after all , he had headed mr clinton s primary campaign in new york , managed the democratic convention and been deputy director of the transition agreed that he should withdraw but there , on the night before mr clinton was to announce his senior staff appointments , clinton aides told mr ickes for the first time that his law firm was under investigation for its work for a union that federal prosecutors say was mobcontrolled the two old friends agreed that mr ickes should withdraw how and why a man mr clinton described after his nomination as one person without whom i might not be here ended up not there himself has become a favorite parlor game in the tight little world of new york politics , where almost everyone knows mr ickes but not everyone likes him it is a political whodunit rich with old feuds and putative intrigues that stretch from the son of one new york city mayoral candidate david n dinkins to the father of another andrew j stein someone wanted to hurt a president , a mayor and harold , and not necessarily in that order , said victor a kovner , a former city corporation counsel and old friend of mr ickes unflattering reports this much is clear mr ickes withdrew after a week of unflattering newspaper and network television reports recalling his role as the lawyer for mr dinkins s 1989 mayoral campaign , when a stock transfer between the candidate and his son david jr became a focus of controversy , and mr ickes s longtime representation of local 100 of the hotel and restaurant employees international union , which federal prosecutors have charged was controlled by organized crime gov mario m cuomo himself felt compelled to deny a gossip columnist s report that he had tried to block the appointment his supposed motive \? friends of both men say the governor has nursed a grudge against mr ickes since the 1982 gubernatorial campaign , when mr ickes was quoted as saying that he had heard others say that mr cuomo had an antisemitic streak in fact , mr cuomo now says he hopes he can find a nonpaying post for mr ickes on some state board as a sign of his regard who those people are and what their motives are can be the subject of endless speculation , which i'm not prepared to do , mr ickes said in his first lengthy interview since he left the white house , where he worked for 10 days after the inauguration last month helping organize the staff but i did think there was a concerted effort to get me the reports surfaced when mr clinton was already under fire for zoe baird s hiring of illegal immigrants and commerce secretary ronald h brown s work as a highpaid lobbyist , and was reluctant , his aides say , to court more controversy with a top white house appointment for the 53yearold mr ickes , who still consults with the president by phone , working in the white house would have carried on the legacy of his father , harold l ickes , franklin d roosevelt s secretary of the interior , who died when mr ickes was 12 'where do we stand \? ' for many democratic politicians in new york government , and perhaps for the city as a whole , his appointment would have meant more a sympathetic ear in the white house after 12 years of republican cold shoulders from manhattan to mineola , li , where mr ickes s law firm of meyer , suozzi , english klein is based , many talked openly of joining him in washington , and were aghast at the outcome people said if that could happen to harold , where do we stand \? said one long island official who is still hoping for a job in the administration they were really scared friends of mr ickes \( pronounced ickeeze \) said they were not surprised at the fealty that led him to make no fuss when his hopes collapsed but he is nothing if not a scrapper in 1965 , he lost a kidney after a beating by three white men in louisiana where he was a civil rights worker , and during the 1973 mayoral campaign of herman badillo an argument with a fellow aide became such a brawl that mr ickes bit into the leg of a third colleague who tried to break it up such tenacity has won him many friends , but also enemies , chief among them prosecutors in the republicanled united states attorney s office in brooklyn , who were unhappy with the limited cooperation he offered their 1990 investigation into the mayor s stock deal with his son when questions arose during the 1989 campaign about the value and nature of the transaction , and whether all necessary taxes had been paid , mr dinkins produced a letter from his son dated 1985 , describing an installment sale no charges brought
will the real ross perot supporters please stand up \? with new jersey s primary race for the republican nomination for governor heating up , everybody seems to be claiming the support of whatever remnants of the texas billionaire s organization remain alive in the state both christine todd whitman and cary edwards , who are regarded as the frontrunners , have maintained that the perot people prefer them jim wallwork , a former state senator and latecomer to the race who is mounting a spirited comefrombehind conservative challenge , this week said that two former perot organizers in the state had endorsed him none of this sets very well with the only extant perot organization still operating in the state , united we stand , america , which says , we have not endorsed anyone a further complication is that mr perot is no longer a candididate , and united we stand , america describes itself as a nonprofit , nonpartisan organization whose mission is to educate our members on the issues too busy talking to vote on the day that residents of hundreds of communities in new jersey were voting in school elections , christine todd whitman , candidate for the republican gubernatorial nomination , was touring the state to outline her new education plan that meant that ms whitman missed voting in her hometown of tewksbury during the april 20 election to decide on a proposed 407 million school budget ordinarily , that might have gone unnoticed , but not after a recount completed last thursday showed the budget vote tied at 207 to 207 it s true , christine did not vote , said joe justin , the spokesman for the whitman campaign she had planned to vote , and it was on the schedule but she was in five counties that day presenting her education plan the tie vote meant that the budget was defeated but the decision is subject to review by the state commissioner of education that might not cure the political damage , however in the tour that kept her from voting , ms whitman proposed public financing for private and parochial schools and insisted , citizen involvement is the key to the successful design of public policy poll heartens the mayor mayor david n dinkins was exulting last week over a new poll of hispanic democratic voters , who are expected to be a pivotal voting bloc in the fall election the telephone survey of 400 registered voters by the el diario fox news poll showed that mr dinkins would handily defeat his democratic rivals among hispanic democrats if a primary were held now of those polled , rounded off , 37 percent were for mr dinkins , 30 percent for herman badillo , the former congressman 9 percent for andrew j stein , the city council president 4 percent for roy innis , the founder of the congress for racial equality , and 21 percent were undecided that only 9 percent said they supported mr stein , who is the mayor s most wellknown and wellheeled challenger , might spell trouble for him mr stein desperately needs to make inroads among spanishspeaking new yorkers if he hopes to crack mr dinkins s coalition of liberals , union members and minorities the poll , conducted april 14 to april 18 , with a margin of error of 5 percent , also suggested that mr dinkins would poll better among hispanic voters than his republican rival , rudolph w giuliani , in a oneonone contest asked about that matchup , 53 percent said they supported mr dinkins , 21 percent mr giuliani and 27 percent were undecided
soon after edwin p fredie assumed duties as milton academy s new headmaster in the fall of 1991 , he surprised the campus at the season s first assembly by standing outside the hall and personally greeting each student his friendliness went against the stereotype of the aloof headmaster of a venerable , prestigious new england boarding school then , having established a reputation for accessibility at the school , in milton , mass , mr fredie also demonstrated his authority at an assembly in the spring where candidates running for studentbody president gave campaign talks , one junior laced his speech with expletives mr fredie promptly stood up to object , saying that such language was inappropriate in a public assembly it stunned people , said leopolvo maza , a teacher of spanish milton is known for its individualism but people also realized he was bringing important ethical standards mr fredie s actions have been under particular scrutiny because he is the first black to be named headmaster of one of the major american private schools , which are often seen as protectors of privilege moreover , while his name rhymes with tweedy , the 47yearold mr fredie is decidedly not preppy he is a product of public school education , albeit boston s best the boston latin school and his career has been spent as a public school teacher and principal that background made him an unusual choice for a private ivycovered institution that was founded in 1798 and includes among its graduates the poet t s eliot , the architect r buckminster fuller and senators robert f kennedy and edward m kennedy with 972 students on its redbrick campus 10 miles south of boston , milton is generally considered one of the most soughtafter schools in the nation but milton s teachers , administrators and alumni are virtually unanimous in praising the performance of mr fredie , a roundfaced man with a quiet , lowkey manner and a reputation as a skilled administrator it is too early for a definitive judgment , but all the signs are very positive , said carol surkin , a 1955 milton graduate , a trustee and a cochairwoman of the search committee that picked mr fredie william moore , a teacher of french , said , he has established a new tone , a very direct , human , tolerant tone and , mr moore said , mr fredie represents multiple perspectives on class and race , so he is ideal for an institution like milton that is committed to diversity lives on campus mr fredie lives on campus in milton s headmaster s house , a comfortable new englandstyle clapboard dwelling , with his wife , marcia after he became headmaster , she quit her job as a merchandise coordinator at the talbot s , a women s clothingstore chain two of the fredies' children are students at milton , while a son , michael , is studying at the coast guard academy and a daughter , kenya , is entering the phd anthropology program at the university of arizona this month although mrs surkin and other members of the search committee deny that race was a factor in mr fredie s selection , a number of people familiar with milton say that , like other leading prep schools , it has been making a determined effort to be more democratic , trying to transform itself into a more culturally diverse school reflecting the realities of contemporary america mr fredie s name was suggested not by the consultant the school hired , but by the parents of a student who lived in needham , another boston suburb , where mr fredie was the high school principal there mr fredie , whose father was a home builder and whose mother was a lawyer , had developed a stellar reputation he had introduced a tough core curriculum that helped raise students' test scores he had also coped with sharply falling enrollment and consequent devastating cutbacks in state and local financing for public education as massachusetts towns were hit by the effects of a new law that restricted their ability to raise property taxes under mr fredie , needham high school went from 1 , 800 students in three grades to 1 , 000 students in four grades mr fredie had to reduce the number of teachers to 100 , from 150 mr fredie acknowledged that when the search committee invited him for a job interview , he was reluctant i had this image of private schools in england , uniforms and mr chips , he said in an interview but he went , and wowed the committee i was sitting next to him and i was amazed , said george e ayers , a vice president of the american association of state colleges and universities , based in washington , dc he was so warm , he had a glow of caring about students as mrs surkin remembers it , that mr fredie would be the first black headmaster of a prep school was a subject that really did n't come up none of us cared a warning on donors but mr ayers , who is also black , said he reminded the committee that some alumni , and potential donors , might be concerned i 've spent 90 percent of my life being the only black dealing with a white world , he said i said , 'you 'll definitely have some people with that concern'
miami , jan 24 when steve cram awoke today to participate in the elite mile portion of the american airlines miami mile , he was told to expect windy , cloudy weather for the race great , said cram , the world record holder in the mile i hope it rains , snows , you name it the worse it is , the better the englishman realized that he might be a little long in the tooth at 32 to match strides with the world s top milers in perfect conditions and today s field , which the race director , mike marcus , called a showdown of champions , included the last two olympic 1 , 500meter champions spain s fermin cacho in barcelona and kenya s peter rono in seoul cram s wish for trying conditions granted , he used a strong headwind as a major ally in coming from back in the pack to win today s race along biscayne boulevard he finished in 3 minutes 589 seconds , about a yard ahead of air force capt mike michno , of kettering , ohio \( 3 592 \) the 23yearold cacho , in his first race of the year , was third in 3 595 , while rono , 25 , pulled up lame , limping in 12th in the 14man field at 4 13 i'm not fast , i'm just strong , said cram because of the wind , this race did n't come down to speed at all at the turn , i did n't kick i just kept going at the same pace i was surprised that none of the guys had a change of pace perhaps it was because none of the runners was in top form a recipient of 1 million from the spanish government for his olympic triumph , cacho said he has had to attend many parties and that has affected my training a little cram acknowledged that because he had done no speed work to prepare him for the race , his stretch run was unusually painful the last 50 yards were excruciating , he said still , he added , someone of my caliber should always be capable of running close to a fourminute mile , even if i have n't done any speed work what you do n't expect is to be able to win races like this cram , who set the world mile mark of 3 4632 in july 1985 , is shifting his focus this year from 1 , 500 meters and mile events to the 5 , 000 meters hill takes women s mile alicia hill , from upland , calif , won the women s elite mile by some 10 yards with a time of 4 349 the defending champion , suzy hamilton , was bothered by a recent neck injury and settled for seventh
chicago , oct 12 ozzie guillen smoked a cigar and spoke proudly about what the white sox had accomplished frank thomas smiled when he discussed the future four other white sox sat near a bucket of beer bottles , reminiscing on the last seven months their season was over , but they managed to smile occasionally although the white sox lost , 63 , to the blue jays in game 6 and lost their chance to claim the american league championship series , they refused to criticize themselves or groan about the outcome what a surprise there were no derogatory remarks about the manager or about the team playing one man short none of that on the final night of the season at comiskey park what filled the clubhouse was an appreciation of a memorable season in which they won 94 games and a division and then lost to a powerful team that was supposed to squash them what filled the clubhouse was anticipation about next season the white sox have perhaps the best hitter in the major leagues in thomas , they definitely have the best group of young starters and some players predicted that this trip to the postseason was no mirage we will be back next year , said bo jackson , who did not play tonight but probably not in this situation probably with champagne spraying on us a precarious position in a bizarre series that saw the visiting team win five of six games , the jays surged to a 20 lead , slipped slightly as the white sox snatched the next two and then won the last two games to grab their second straight american league pennant once the white sox stranded 23 runners in the first two games and allowed a talented toronto team a cushion , their position became precarious they charged back , but losing the first two at home was deadly all those lost opportunities we had in the first two games is what i 'll remember , thomas said i wish we played like we did in the last four games the first two games were a terrible effort by us we learned a lot from those games hopefully , the world will take a close look at the white sox after this when the world takes a close look at the white sox , it will still see problems that the jays exploited by walking thomas a alcs series record 10 times in six games , the jays dared someone else in the order to damage them and it did not occur as cleanup batter robin ventura was 4 for 20 the white sox need a more productive hitter behind thomas they might also need a leadoff hitter because tim raines is a free agent and he said tonight that no one has spoken to him about returning the bell question one player who is probably not returning is george bell , who did not bat in the series and severely criticized manager gene lamont before game 3 for not playing him bell said he did not respect lamont as a manager or as man the white sox can buy out bell s option for 500 , 000 or pay him 32 million to play , and that question seems to be a simple one i'm going to go to florida , go to my boat , turn on the engine and have a happy life , bell said there s nothing else i can say about it the lost opportunities were present again tonight as the white sox were tamed by dave stewart and duane ward , and they did n't help themselves by committing three errors trailing by 32 in the eighth inning , they had the potential tying run on first base when ward replaced stewart and whiffed both ventura and ellis burks to terminate chicago s rally the jays erupted for three important insurance runs in the ninth to help negate a solo homer by warren newson the big hit came one inning late for chicago in most of the series , it never came i would n't say we were pressing , raines said we just did n't get enough hits if we played tomorrow , maybe we would get 15 hits then raines laughed he knew tomorrow would be too late the innings had dwindled down to zero for the white sox and their first american league west title since 1983 would not end with a pennant still , they searched for positives we did n't give up for one second or one minute , guillen said we lost to a team with seven superstars in the lineup we still have the young talent i believe we 're a world series team to look at in the future the final words were from bo i'm not sad one bit , jackson said we 're going to walk out of this locker room with our heads up we 're not losers they were just a better ball club photo bo jackson , who was benched as the white sox s designated hitter , watching as the blue jays widened their lead in the ninth inning last night \( agence francepresse \)
inglewood , calif , jan 6 wayne gretzky did more than make a cameo appearance tonight he assisted on two goals , skated long shifts without ever hunching over to catch his breath and generally looked to be his old mobile self only three months ago , pain from his herniated thoracic disk still riveted much of his upper torso , and the greatest scorer in hockey seemed resigned to retirement at age 31 on airplane trips , he would need permission from flight attendants to lay flat on the floor in a restaurant once , he lay spreadeagled on the carpet to ease his back pain , and an unknowing waitress assumed he was drunk yet , gretzky his pain inconspicuous by its absense returned to live duty for the los angeles kings in a game tonight against the tampa bay lightning fans were handed welcome back , wayne placards at the door , and there were catcalls of let s go , wayne during the national anthem people here are generally more laid back than that his grand entrance came 48 seconds into the game , and his shift lasted 45 seconds without him touching the puck or him even being touched by a lightning player he was making absolutely no difference to his team at first the kings , a mere 173 in their last 11 games , fell behind by 40 early in the second period it was clear other players were leery of checking him at one point , gretzky lost the puck on a mild collision , and tampa bay defenseman peter taglianetti actually grabbed him to keep him from falling flat but , just when the crowd began booing the kings , gretzky perked things up he smacked a pass across the kings' zone , from one circle to another , and rob blake scored on a slap shot another pass set up a goal by mik donnelly , and by the end of two periods , the kings trailed by only 53 they came no closer and lost , 63 reveling in the moment gretzky had been working diligently for this before a morning practice today , he even beat the zamboni to the ice in solitude , he performed his version of a power skate , a 30minute series of figureeights and changeofdirection spins he made sure to touch every crevice of the forum rink every halfhour counts , he said when the ensuing fullsquad practice had ended , none of gretzky s los angeles kings teammates patted him , congratulatorily , on the back that is because for the last five months , gretzky s back has been offlimits tonight it was back on limits he was clearly reveling in the moment had surgery been performed , as a last resort , doctors would have had to make an incision from the front and weave around his ribs to correct his condition going in from the back would have meant shifting the spinal cord , which is too risky to attempt fear of paralysis he thinks the injury was caused by the cumulative effect of blindside hits over the years all he knows is that one day during this season s training camp , he took a nondirect blow that riddled him enough to get him to a doctor the doctor ordered him to the hospital , but gretzky s wife , janet jones , was already in a hospital , preparing to deliver their third child i told the doc , 'i 've got to go home my wife s having a baby , ' gretzky said but he said , 'you do n't understand you might not get to your wife' the doctor had feared paralysis surgery was avoided after relentless treatment directed by dr robert watkins then , once the pain ceased about six weeks ago , gretzky tugged on watkins s sleeve daily , asking if he could start skating oh , i would get on them every day , saying , 'i'm ready , i'm ready , ' gretzky said but they held me back keeping a close watch for tonight s game , gretzky expected his mother , phyllis , to fly in , but his wife had arranged it so that gretzky s father , walter who suffered a stroke last season could also fly in , with a special therapist shocked me , gretzky said his teammates , naturally , were keeping an eye on him tonight , to guard tampa bay players from roughing him gretzky s main concern , he said , was not to make like a snail and slow his team i think it 'll be a lot like when i did saturday night live , ' he said before the game everybody on that show worked hard because they knew i could n't act they all worked hard around me to make it better and i think the way the response around the locker room is , it s i have n't played in a long time and i'm probably a little unsure of myself , so everybody wants their game to fit with mine i 'll be a positive in that they 'll work harder so i wo n't make us look bad and when he got his first assist tonight , his teammates finally felt free enough to smack him on the back photo wayne gretzky going through a skating drill during a workout tuesday \( associated press \)
washington fifty years after the nazis , will a european state led by a murderous demagogue be allowed to slaughter and expel another people because of their religion \? the question has faced europe and the united states since serbian aggression began in the former yugoslavia 18 months ago and no matter how hard european leaders and president clinton wish , it will not go away slobodan milosevic of serbia calculated from the beginning that the europeans and americans would wring their hands , say tuttut and do nothing that really mattered as serb forces attacked the bosnian muslims so far he has been exactly right the latest trophy of his strategy is srebrenica after solemnly pledging to cease fire a week ago , serbian generals let go with massive shelling that killed 53 civilians in the town over the weekend , a ceasefire demanded by the un went into effect , on terms that will save life but effectively end muslim control the increasingly brazen serbian aggression is accompanied by denials that would have made joseph goebbels blush thus the bosnian serb leader , radovan karadzic , said he had ordered that not a cigarette butt land in srebrenica serbian television said the 53 supposed victims were really serbs who had been captured and killed margaret thatcher , the former british prime minister , called on the west to use its air power and let the bosnian government buy weapons to fight we cannot let things go on like this , she said it is evil lady thatcher s remarks seemed only to increase the defensiveness of both british and american officials secretary of state warren christopher dismissed her appeal as rather emotional as if , when more than 100 , 000 people have been killed and 1 million expelled because of their religion , emotion were inappropriate but why is it america s business \? if the europeans have failed to meet the challenge , why look to us \? the answer is that this country is the only superpower and the world will not move unless and until our president does under the headline bosnia waits for clinton , joe rogaly wrote in the financial times , london , last week only president clinton can stop the serbs it is up to the united states to decide whether the artillery used against women and children in srebrenica and elsewhere should be bombed if when it does , its nato allies will participate or acquiesce the president , evidently embarrassed by the assault on srebrenica , said he was looking again at all options but he still seems unwilling to do anything that might actually worry the serbian aggressors the trouble is that the fig leaf mr clinton has used to cover a donothing policy has vanished the fig leaf was the peace plan proposed by lord owen and cyrus vance any military intervention , it was argued , would be fatal to the peace process there is no longer any pretense of a peace process even lord owen , who for months furiously argued against military intervention , has said that if the serbs are hellbent on taking other towns , then we will have to meet this assault on muslim towns with military action it is understandable that bill clinton prefers to avoid meaningful action in bosnia he is determined to be a domestic president to tackle the terrible problems afflicting the united states at home so he does not want to use his political capital on bosnia but an american president who rallies his people to a good cause abroad does not lose political capital he gains it indeed , if george bush had used his standing after the persian gulf war to fight for a domestic program , he might still be president there are many horrors in the world today but none worse than the unapologetic aggression and murder in bosnia , and none so central to the established american interest in a peaceful europe joe rogaly , the financial times columnist , wrote that lady thatcher had made britons ask themselves , where do i stand \? he answered we must not accept that no military counterforce can be deployed when a gang of warriors , acting in the name of national identity , commits every atrocity , every slaughter , in order to gain lebensraum on european soil if we do , we are nothing and if we do , we americans are nothing

resilience in the arab world , they call him the cat with nine lives no leading arab figure has survived more setbacks than mr arafat , whose latest exploit has been to strike a deal with israel that has revived his bankrupt , nearly defunct palestine liberation organization on monday , unless there is another sudden change , mr arafat , the plo chairman , the man who survived a civil war in jordan in 1970 , an israeli invasion of lebanon in 1982 , several assassination attempts , a plane crash , and countless bad decisions of his own will be standing with president clinton and prime minister yitzhak rabin of israel on the white house lawn end of a search whether or not he actually signs the document in which israel will recognize the plo or shakes anyone s hand , his very presence will mark the end of an incredible search for prestige and for recognition of an organization that washington refused to deal with for years his birthplace is a mystery there is no official biography , but informed palestinians say that while mr arafat s family is from gaza and he spent his youth between the strip and jerusalem , he was born in cairo , where he returned for high school and college mr arafat has hinted a number of times that his mother shares the ancestry of faisal alhusseini , the palestinian negotiator , who comes from an ancient wellknown family , but this account has been disputed ever since he began his tortuous road as a student at cairo university s prestigious school of engineering , he moved from exile to exile after forming the first cell of his own guerrilla group , fatah , in kuwait in 1959 , he abandoned what he said was a very successful career as a contractor to devote himself fully to the palestinian revolution in the late 1960 s , he moved to jordan soon after he was elected president of the plo in 1969 , he built it into an umbrella organization that encompassed military , political and social organizations as his power base in jordan grew , he became embroiled in a struggle with king hussein of jordan , who became concerned that the plo was planning to take over the country what ensued was a bitter nineday civil war in 1970 that has become known as black september thousands of palestinians and hundreds of king hussein s bedouin soldiers fought streetbystreet battles that ended in mr arafat s first big strategic defeat by an arab army he fled to lebanon quickly , however , he began to make his first comeback , building a much bigger , more influential statewithinastate in lebanon than he had in jordan golden age in beirut in the early 1970 s , thousands of young palestinians flocked to join abu ammar , as palestinians call mr arafat beirut saw the golden age of mr arafat s plo and lebanese and arab politicians looked to him for political consultations , photo opportunities and deals millions flowed into the organization s coffers from the gulf arabs as well as other oilrich states like libya and iraq in the 1970 s , the plo fast became one of the international left s most romantic organizations when it began to sponsor the hijacking of airplanes , it became one of the most famous while its aim was to wage a war against israel , mr arafat s grandiose schemes cast it against much of the west with support from much of the communist world accumulating power by that time , mr arafat was also commander in chief of an estimated 15 , 000 palestinian troops , chairman of the plo and president of fatah that marked the beginning of his pattern of accumulating power in his hands he now also has the title of president of palestine and has received ambassadors like the pakistani envoy who presented him with his credentials on thursday it was also in beirut that mr arafat developed his flair for theatrics and costume the neatly pressed olivedrab fatigues and the kaffiyeh , a palestinian headdress , and matching ascot but the secret of his success remained as always his fine sense of what his people want wrong or right , he rarely went against the instincts of most palestinians , even when , as in the case of the palestinians' support of iraq during the gulf crisis , the instincts led to catastrophe palestinians may criticize mr arafat bitterly , but all it takes is the sight of him to make them melt in admiration he cultivates personal loyalties the way a farmer tends to his field he has been known to astonish visitors with his memory of previous encounters he is a dictator who always speaks of the palestine liberation organization as a democratic organization in fact , he does allow a margin of freedom to his fellow leaders that permits an extraordinary amount of dissent , far more than any other arab ruler biding his time in the last few days here , for example , while the world awaited the plo s decision on the final text of two agreements with israel , he let dissenters vent all their poison against him , against israel and against the proposed accord all he had to do was call for a vote but he took his time and said little when the vote came , it was when none of his associates had anything further to add and , more significantly , after he had let the whole world know that his answer was going to be yes
washington , nov 4 struggling to convince americans that its health care plan would save most people money , the clinton administration today produced its third set of predictions of how many americans would pay more , or less , for health insurance last week , donna e shalala , secretary of health and human services , threw a scare into the administration s friends and cheered its enemies by declaring that 40 percent of americans who now have health insurance would pay more today , leon e panetta , the administration s budget director , wanted it understood that 70 percent would either pay less or the same as they do now he told the senate finance committee today that the average saving would be 61 a month for each household the other 30 percent would pay an average of 24 a month more but the change , based on more detailed calculations , still left clinton allies worried about the administration s political salesmanship as senator john d rockefeller 4th of west virginia put it , when the administration continues to pump out numbers , people have less reason to say , i believe you not much variation in fact , none of the numbers differ that much from one another the chief reason that last week s 40 percent became this week s 30 percent is that this week s numbers include estimates of outofpocket payments as well as insurance premiums last week s figure counted only premiums this shift occurred because many people now have insurance coverage for catastrophic medical expenses only their premiums are not as high as those for the comprehensive coverage mr clinton is proposing in the end , the new system could cost them less because their present insurance does not pay for most visits to the doctor and the clinton plan would cost is an important part of the debate over the clinton health care plan , one of the biggest social programs in american history predicting the overall cost in the long term involves complex guesswork estimates , for example , of such imponderables as how often uninsured people will eventually go to the doctor after they get insurance but the latest calculations involve only the first year of the plan , before the actual rates could catch up with miscalculations about how people will use the insurance plan nor was the problem last week so much the 40 percent number put forward by dr shalala it was not very different from the numbers hillary rodham clinton used in congressional testimony more than a month ago that passed almost unnoticed mrs clinton has testified that 35 percent to 37 percent of the households in this country would pay more but she had emphasized in a round of house testimony on sept 28 that most of them will pay a little bit more for better benefits , and only 10 percent to 12 percent will pay more for the same amount of benefits and that last group , she emphasized was mostly composed of healthy young people who think they are immortal but dr shalala did not choose merely to repeat mrs clinton s words and say more complete data was on the way instead , she offered a graph that highlighted the number of households that would pay more for their premiums the graph , instant food for television , did not show the rest of the argument , that most of those households would be getting more coverage along with higher premiums the administration promptly tried to restate the contention about more coverage urging supporters in congress to make the point for them even so , senator bob dole of kansas , the republican leader , said after the hearing that dr shalala s testimony showed the administration had been selling the plan too hard we need to stop all the hype , he said republican attack and representative newt gingrich , republican of georgia and a critic of the plan , said on the cbs news program face the nation on sunday that if the administration thought 40 percent would pay more , then in reality at least 60 percent would , and they would find a system controlled by a bureaucrat who will define for them what they 're going to get having paid 60 percent more in fact , dr shalala said no such thing her chart indicated very few people would pay anything like 60 percent more no one stumble is crucial in a campaign everyone knows will last months but the administration s public relations strategy has been long on inspiring message and short on detail and followthrough some administration friends on capitol hill worry that while this approach may not have been a bad in an election campaign , it is not a healthy prescription for a long legislative campaign during which congress can keep its eye on the ball today s numbers were not in mr panetta s prepared testimony , but he brought them up almost as an academic explanation of the difficulties of projections he said it was important to look at all payments , not just premiums , as last week s report to this committee had done average savings estimated what does it mean in terms of outofpocket costs as far as deductibles , as far as copayments are concerned \? he asked when you look at that issue , when you look at the issue of the full outofpocket costs , our estimate is that you are looking at nearly 70 percent of americans , of insured americans who would be paying the same or less for the benefits that they receive , saving on average , we estimate , about 61 per month , including copayments and deductibles his office was available later with a more detailed breakdown , including the estimate that in the first year , 151 percent of families would save more than 83 a month , or 1 , 000 a year , while only 1 in 1 , 000 would pay 83 more a month but he sought really to drop the new numbers in as an aside , and go on to what the administration would like everyone to think of as the more fundamental issue if we fail to pass this plan , 100 percent of americans can be expected to pay higher insurance premiums 100 percent because that is where health care costs are going right now
lawenforcement officials said yesterday that they have identified a new suspect in the killing of a hasidic scholar during the crown heights disturbances two years ago the officials said they believe that it was this suspect who joined a crowd attacking the man , yankel rosenbaum , and delivered the stab wounds that killed him the brooklyn district attorney is trying to persuade united states attorney general janet reno to bring a broad civil rights case against the suspect , who is now in prison for unrelated crimes and to include in that case charges against lemrick nelson jr , who has been tried in state court and acquitted of the slaying of mr rosenbaum police commissioner raymond w kelly identified the new suspect yesterday as ernesto edwards , a 24yearold panama native who has been convicted at least five times , four times on drug charges and once of attempted robbery since 1988 and is now in prison for attempted robbery and drug dealing a new account the officials said they now believe that mr nelson stabbed mr rosenbaum once and then handed mr edwards the knife that account differs from the one the police and the brooklyn district attorney , charles j hynes , presented in october of last year during their unsuccessful attempt to convict mr nelson of the killing of mr rosenbaum in that case , prosecutors argued that mr nelson should be convicted because mr rosenbaum identified him as his attacker before he died , and because the police said that the murder weapon was found in mr nelson s pocket and that he confessed to the killing soon after the stabbing details emerge since then , a state investigation of the crown heights disturbances and their aftermath concluded that lapses by the police and by mr hynes s office in prosecuting the case had contributed to the acquittal investigators are also a seeking other new suspects , who are believed to have kicked and punched mr rosenbaum during the attack no new charges have been filed against mr edwards or anyone else , and no one has been arrested the filing of charges is less urgent because mr edwards is in prison the details of how lawenforcement officials learned of mr edwards s link to the rosenbaum killing came yesterday from police officials and other law enforcement authorities who spoke on the condition that they not be named mr edwards was first identified as a suspect yesterday in an article in the new york post the officials described events in which a federal investigation into the killing had stalled until local officials benefited from a piece of good luck an old witness to the crown heights disturbances who changed his story alone , the witness would have left prosecutors on shaky ground , the lawenforcement officials said , because they would have been relying on the testimony of someone who had changed his account but after that witness came forward , investigators came up with two others , the officials said a former girlfriend of mr edwards s and a fellow inmate who said he heard mr edwards claim credit for the killing the evidence came together three and half months after the justice department was prepared to reject the requests of several new york legislators and brooklyn s hasidic community to pursue a federal case against mr nelson ms reno delayed that decision after a phone call from mr hynes , but at the time none of the new information had surfaced lawenforcement officials said they now expect mr hynes to prepare a murder case against mr edwards for consideration by a state grand jury were mr nelson , who was 17 when he was tried , to be tried again , it would have to be in federal court on civil rights charges because of his acquittal on murder charges at the state level the crown heights disturbances and the killing of mr rosenbaum increased tensions between blacks and jews and shook the dinkins administration , which was severely criticized for its handling of the events mr rosenbaum was killed on the first of four nights of disturbances in crown heights in august 1991 the disturbances were prompted by the death of a 7yearold black boy , gavin cato , who was struck and killed by a car in the motorcade of the leader of the lubavitcher hasidim the brother of mr rosenbaum , norman , said yesterday that his family was encouraged by news of the new suspect , but until there s somebody in jail , we 've got nothing neither myself nor my parents are building our hopes , mr rosenbaum said in a telephone interview from australia , where he lives although we 're encouraged , we 've seen what a brooklyn jury does to guilty people in the case of lemrick nelson asked about the case at a news conference yesterday , mayorelect rudolph w giuliani said , justice in that case has long been waiting i do n't know the reason why the justice department has taken over a year to make a decision that normally takes two or three months , said mr giuliani , who said he had spoken with norman rosenbaum lawenforcement officials said their first break in the case came in october , when the witness changed his story the witness had previously told the police that he saw mr rosenbaum emerge from his car at president street and brooklyn avenue and begin kicking at a group of black men standing on the corner , but that he did not see mr rosenbaum stabbed the officials said that the witness revised his account during a visit to the 71st precinct stationhouse in crown heights , where he went to talk with the police about a different case the killing of a close friend of his a detective who has stayed on the rosenbaum case recognized the witness and asked him again about the case detectives had been encouraged over the last two years to ask most suspects and witnesses who came into the stationhouse whether they had information about the killing and in many instances , lawenforcement officials said , the detectives were given leeway to make promises of leniency in exchange for information the officials said that the murder of the witness s friend had given him a new sympathy for mr rosenbaum , as well as regrets about what he had previously told the police he gave his new account of the moments leading to mr rosenbaum s death during several hours of discussion with detective edward brown , and he identified mr edwards as the one who stabbed mr rosenbaum three times in the chest , the officials said jailed briefly mr edwards , not only had a criminal record , but also had been jailed briefly after police said he had participated in a separate incident during the crown heights disturbances a stampede through an abraham straus store in brooklyn two days after mr rosenbaum was killed a month after the witness came forward , on nov 21 , a prison inmate sent a letter to mr hynes s office saying that mr edwards had confessed that he had killed mr rosenbaum , lawenforcement officials said and after that , a third witness who police officials identified as a former girlfriend of mr edwards told detectives that mr edwards had told her that he had beaten and stabbed mr rosenbaum

newark , nov 15 a federal judge today directed edward j rollins , the republican political consultant , to answer questions under oath this week about whether christine todd whitman s campaign paid ministers and democratic campaign workers to hold down the black vote in the nov 2 election for new jersey governor a lawyer for mr rollins said his client was anxious to get the story out and intended to deny any knowledge of efforts to discourage black voters outside court after the hearing today , state senator raymond lesniak , the new jersey state democratic chairman , said he knew of democratic workers who were approached by the republicans asked not to work elaborating on his remarks in a later interview , senator lesniak said we have democratic party workers who were approached by republicans and asked not to work we also have leads on other democratic workers who were approached and accepted the payments , but we do n't have those names yet mr lesniak refused to identify those party workers who he said were approached , saying the party feared it would jeopardize its investigation he would not answer questions about who approached the workers or how he knew they were republicans he also would not discuss specific towns involved , when the offers were made , what was offered and when people came forward to tell him they had been approached so far , he said , the leads amounted to a handful of people in union , hudson and passaic counties these things start small , he said right now , it just does n't amount to enough evidence and we 're following up on our investigation the senator also said he did not believe any evidence would be found that ministers received any money sworn statements in addition to ordering mr rollins to answer questions , judge dickinson r debevoise of federal district court said the democratic national and state committees can also take sworn statements next week from webster b todd jr , mrs whitman s brother , and john carbone , a lawyer for the state republican party he did so over protests by lawyers for the whitman campaign and for the republican state committee , mr rollins , who took over from mr todd as campaign manager for the closing weeks of the campaign , touched off a storm of protest when he told a washington breakfast meeting with reporters last week that republicans had 500 , 000 in walking around money , some of which was used to pay black ministers to forgo urging their congregations to vote for gov jim florio and to pay democratic campaign workers to take election day off the day after the breakfast meeting mrs whitman strongly denied that any such activities took place , and mr rollins issued a statement in which he said his remarks were an exaggeration that ended up describing things that did not happen but the democrats argued successfully today that mr rollins s statements must be examined further if any interference with black voters is proved , senator lesniak said , mrs whitman s 26 , 000vote victory over mr florio should be voided and a new election held today mrs whitman said , i am confident that any investigation will reveal that the actions attributed to the campaign never occurred a week after the controversy began , no minister has stepped forward to say they were paid , or even offered money , by the republicans , nor have any of the newspapers persuing the case reported locating one veterans of political campaigns in new jersey s urban areas say they are somewhat surprised at the furor over the competitive use of street money on election day they said that for decades it has been the norm for political parties , chiefly the old democratic machines , to put hundreds of thousands of dollars on the streets to pay for workers , transportation , food and other costs associated with motivating voters in densely populated areas to go to the polls and , they added , it would not break new ground if one party competed for workers by offering to outbid the rival party but that casual use of street money would be relegated to new jersey political history under legislation introduced in trenton today by assembly speaker garabed \( chuck \) haytaian and assemblyman robert shinn jr , the chairman of the republican caucus i believe with all my heart that none of the allegations , innuendoes and rumors sparked by ed rollins s false and reckless comments last week are true and that the investigations currently underway will prove it , mr haytaian said but none of that matters as much as restoring the public trust that has been shaken by this incident we must restore the public s confidence in our electoral system the proposed legislation would not outlaw the practice of distributing street money on election day it would require that all electioncampaign payments to individuals , including street money , be made by check , rather than in cash this bill would see to it that there is a paper trail for all to see and follow , mr shinn said it would make sure every cent spent by a campaign is paid for by check , whether the amount be for a penny or for a hundred thousand dollars
the endangered american dream how to stop the united states from becoming a thirdworld country and how to win the geoeconomic struggle for industrial supremacy by edward n luttwak 365 pages simon schuster 24 much will seem familiar about edward n luttwak s cumbersomely subtitled but important economic jeremiad , the endangered american dream scarcely another book is required to tell us that the american economy is declining relative to other firstworld industrial powers that the country increasingly lacks patient capital investment and a highly skilled work force that its middle class is shrinking while the gap between the superrich and the poor grows apace that one of the causes of these problems has been the economic growth of japan , not so much through its people s superior diligence , but more because of unfair trade practices that america must now fight back by paying off its huge debts , revamping its deteriorating publicschool system and adopting an industrial policy of its own to contend with those of europe and japan all this has been written before in recent books too numerous to list indeed , mr luttwak has said much of it himself a director at the center for strategic and international studies of washington and the author of half a dozen previous books , among them the pentagon and the art of war and strategy the logic of war and peace , he has repeatedly testified before congress what is new here is the detail he supplies to illustrate his points details ranging from a description of urban crime as america s permanent intifadah , to a survey of the sort of productliability suits that increasingly impede american commerce , to a review of the illdefined ethnic and racial categories to which teachers in the san diego unified school district must now be sensitive \( for instance , as he quotes the official directive , a hmong is a person having origins in any of the original peoples of laos or cambodia and are of the hmong culture or origin \) and what is newly compelling in this book is mr luttwak s thesis that whereas the nations of the world once competed geopolitically , with the end of the cold war they now compete geoeconomically , a point he first developed publicly in the pregulf war hearings of the united states senate in this view , it is no longer by territory that countries measure their strength , but by industrial productivity using that measure , he sees the united states as fated to become a thirdworld economy by the third decade of the next millennium , or a nation of lowwage , assemblyline workers or poorly paid hamburgerflippers what is to be done \? \( as he titles his chapter of proposed solutions \) for one thing , he insists , the public educational system must be overhauled by giving extra federal pay to teachers who can pass uniform , nationwide , written qualification exams , by rewarding students with federal diplomas for tested educational achievement and by strengthening vocational training and workstudy programs for another thing , he writes , the country should promote capital investment by doing away with what he characterizes as productivityinhibiting social security and corporate taxes , and introducing valueadded taxes , which , he says , cut down on consumption and encourage savings finally , america should renounce its mindless faith in freemarket ideology \( as damaging , he believes , as marxistleninist dogma \) and adopt an industrialpolicy apparatus to compete with the ministry of international trade and industry in japan and comparable bureaucracies elsewhere in the world after all , if japan is n't proof enough that industrial policy works , then the nation can look to the very 'japanese' semiconductor policy pursued by the very same reagan administration that issued long perorations on the evils of industrial policy , or to the united states advanced battery consortium , or , most recently , to america s flat panel consortium for computer display screens these , he argues , are some of the most dramatic proofs that industrial policy is viable for this country none of these arguments are likely to sweep opponents of mr luttwak s views off their feet the organization of his book is somewhat haphazard , his arguments frequently lurching uneasily from broad generalization to nearobsessive detail while his views are often trenchant , they sometimes become mired in pages of mindnumbing statistics nor is his non numerical prose always winning , tainted as it sometimes is by overly harsh ridicule of the proponents of multiculturalism or by the crude sense of humor apparent in his suggestion that in the hypothetical event of a wave of capitalrich swiss immigration , americans would be content enough with their rising wages to tolerate a fair amount of noisy yodeling more seriously , mr luttwak does not trouble to rebut the theoretical basis of a belief in international free trade he merely waves it away with an unfavorable example or two in any case , as his argument turns out , his point is not really that freemarket ideology is false , but rather that , like unilateral nuclear disarmament , it may not be entirely practical in a world that embraces the opposite view finally , what he argues most effectively is that as long as the nations of the world wage geoeconomic warfare , americans must be willing to arm themselves appropriately , just as they did when geopolitics was the game as he concludes the choice that remains for the united states is between the successful negotiation of a sweeping geoeconomic disarmament , and the waging of the geoeconomic struggle in full force the looming presence of expansionist international corporations , activist bureaucracies , and economically ambitious governments none of which is to be found on main street , usa , or in economics textbooks requires that the choice be made and acted upon not to choose is to lose photo of edward n luttwak \( dalya luttwak \)

to the editor news articles about the death of vincent w foster jr , the white house lawyer , have not addressed the medical or psychological underpinnings of suicide , which are newsworthy , especially to a new crop of overworked washington professionals instead , news accounts seem to reach for a political angle , sometimes stretching to find a conspiracy where none exists from week to week the story changes , from president clinton s inability to attribute specific motives to the white house staff s suspected feeding of misinformation to a dispute over whether a box of papers had been taken from mr foster s office or reporters write the obvious vince foster was full of fury , despair , depression there is no tidy explanation for why a 48yearold father and husband at the pinnacle of his career puts a gun in his mouth and fires there was no simple explanation why my mother , then a 45yearold national political writer for the los angeles times , put a gun in her mouth and fired the washington press corps seems incapable of seeing suicide for what it is they fail to see that the subjects of their daily stories the white house staff , the administration source , the president of the united states are human beings human beings can become overworked and stressed under the pressures of long days , sharp deadlines , fierce competition tired and lonely people act irrationally all alone , without a soul s knowledge or forewarning , people kill themselves the act is stunning , takes years to comprehend , is never understood karen e skelton pittsburgh , aug 12 , 1993
back in september , when anthony s d'amato was still chairman and chief executive of borden inc , an important shareholder came calling to discuss the company s problems and prospects the shareholder wanted to know whether mr d'amato would be hiring an executive recruiter to help find talented directors for two new slots being added to the board the question drew a pained look from mr d'amato i 've had more consultants in here , i ca n't face another one we 've had mckinsey we 've had everybody , the shareholder , nell minow , a principal of lens inc , recalled mr d'amato as saying and how in recent months , the underperforming food and chemical company has had the benefit of counsel from at least two investment banks , lazard freres and first boston the law firm of wachtell , lipton , rosen katz , and two management consultants , mckinsey company and boozallen hamilton a slew of unsolicited confidential reports have also landed on the desks of borden s officers and directors from shareholders like lens the chore of picking among the rival plans , all tugging the company in different directions , now falls to the board , which on thursday demanded that mr d'amato resign , and to his replacement , ervin r shames what truly sets borden , based in columbus , ohio , apart from nearly all the companies that have undergone the catharsis that comes with trading their old chief executive for a new one is that in this case there is absolutely no consensus about how to get the company back on track at eastman kodak , in contrast , the remedy was clear nearly all the critics were clamoring for the company to tame a bloated headcount and spin off an unrelated chemical business to shareholders , which it eventually agreed to do likewise , at sears , roebuck shareholders and analysts collectively advised the company to spin off its brokerage subsidiary as a separate company and to bolster operating management at the retail stores the board dutifully obliged at borden , the board finally appears to be listening to shareholder complaints about years of stagnant revenues and earnings , but the solutions are far more elusive this company is not loaded with great brands that can stand up to this difficult pricing environment , said john m mcmillin , a food analyst at prudential securities unlike kodak , there is no hidden jewel here there s no quick fix none of borden s four divisions was ever a standout , and margins have deteriorated across the board in the two years that mr d'amato was at the helm grocery products , which include pastas and niche items like cracker jack , and packaging and other nonfood products , both earned operating margins of 64 percent in 1992 dairy lost 15 percent , while snacks brought up the rear with operating losses of 82 percent spinning off the more attractive pieces makes some sense but might leave the company without the wherewithal to support its growing debt at the same time , selling the company kit and caboodle to another giant in the pasta , snack or dairy business could raise the hackles of the antitrust cops because of borden s enormous market shares \( unilever and nestle are supposedly sniffing , but many think those are long shots \) potential suitors would also have to contend with the hassles of investigating dozens of small niche businesses in farflung industries the due diligence might be a painful process , mr mcmillin warned even people who have supposedly been on the same side in the fight to get the board to take action quibble over how to handle simpler agenda items like what to do to improve the board alan i greene , one of the company s bigger shareholders with 25 million shares , thinks the board needs more veterans from the food industry , while lens , a smaller shareholder , thinks turnaround experience is needed lens has also been calling on the company to ease romeo j ventres , mr d'amato s predecessor , off the board to make way for fresh thinking mr ventres did not return a call seeking comment as for the larger issues facing the company , there is simply no agreement charles l balakonis , an executive recruiter who is a former borden vice president , thinks the company should shed some of its smaller peripheral brands and use the cash to advertise its stronger brand names and create new products lens is calling for far more drastic measures , such as jettisoning anything that cannot be immediately justified , even if that is the prelude to a liquidation consumers have become less willing to pay for good brand names , let alone tired ones they should have the burden of proof that this collection of assets is a business , said robert a g monks , another lens principal mr mcmillin , the food analyst , recommends cutting the dividend , selling snacks and any specialty grocery lines like soups that do not move very much product , and seeing what mr shames , a highly regarded marketeer , can do with the rest a more patient approach , he argues , might yield more for shareholders in the long run than the 22 a share he figures they would receive in a liquidation , after repaying all debts peter cusack , a former head of personnel at borden and the executive recruiter who brought in mr shames , thinks the problem comes down to not having the right people i realize that may sound selfserving , since i recruit people for a living , he said but they 've got a civil service mentality at that company you go out at 5 o'clock in the parking lot in columbus and watch people pour out of the building it looks like the post office given that the board appears to have disliked whatever mr d'amato proposed at its nov 30 meeting , analysts and shareholders think the board is leaning toward more drastic medicine obviously , the board wanted something more radical , said mr mcmillin graph showing borden s assets \( source borden s public filings prudential securities \)
the french performance artist orlan is proving that there s more than one way to suffer in the name of art , and make a spectacle of yourself in the process her material is her own body and skin her medium is plastic surgery , usually performed on her on camera her work represents a small step for conceptual art , and a big step for feminism both in the backward direction so far , orlan has endured seven operations in an effort to make her face resemble a composite likeness of five mythic women , ranging from the goddess diana , as painted by an unknown fontainebleau artist , to leonardo da vinci s mona lisa each operation has been videotaped for posterity at its center is the artist herself , who always stays awake throughout these procedures , accompanied by costumed assistants and sundry props orlan s latest round of surgery , intended to bolster her chin , temples , cheekbones and nose with plastic implants , is the subject of omnipresence , her exhibition at the sandra gering gallery in soho the exhibition began on nov 21 when the operation , performed in a doctor s operating room on the upper east side , was not only videotaped , but also broadcast live by satellite , for 90 minutes , to the gallery there , a group of invited guests and television crews watched the proceedings and asked the artist questions by phone or fax observers at a dozen other outposts around the globe , including the pompidou center in paris , the mcluhan center in toronto and the home of the french critic pierre restany in milan , participated through a picturephone hookup at gering , a slightly shortened version of the 90minute broadcast shows the havoc of the operating room , painted bright green for the occasion , and full of people wearing brightgreen or black medical robes and tall cylindrical hats with a slightly renaissance air while being prepped for surgery , the artist fields questions about her work , with one assistant translating her responses into english and another into sign language with several people talking and gesticulating at once , the video s opening sequence has all the charm of a marx brothers movie without the jokes as surgery begins , things naturally become more riveting , or revolting , depending upon one s tolerance for blood seeing the skin pried away from its usual moorings , its malleability graphically demonstrated , may be a shock to those outside the medical profession , but it never transcends the level of a documentary , and a poor , rather boring documentary at that the show also includes a photographic record , accumulating at the rate of one picture a day , of the artist in recovery , her head bandaged , her face puffy , her eyes blackened these images are contrasted with nonetooseamless computer photographs of her face fused with one or another of the five mythic women also on view are relics of the operation the somewhat bloodsplattered green robe worn by the surgeon , to which photographs of the artist on the operating table were later attached a black robe worn by one of her assistants , its sleeve printed with the phrase the body is but a costume orlan s work fits into a notsolengthy tradition of art that involves extreme invasions of the artist s body or privacy after all , we have seen photographs of chris burden having himself shot in the arm by a marksman , or crossing live electrical wires close to his chest , and we 've seen images of jeff koons and his wife , ilona staller , having sex maybe the world is ready to witness a little plastic surgery as art the problem is , nothing orlan does is very interesting to look at or think about it s sensationalist , and also too close to real life , not the least in its mindless acceptance of socially imposed ideals of beauty the distance between undergoing surgery in hopes of looking like vanna white and submitting to it to resemble a highart , highbrow ideal like mona lisa is ultimately only a matter of taste , the underlying element of selfloathing and selfdestructive perfectionism remaining the same but even before one gets to the prolonged feminist argument that could be made against it , there is simply the esthetic amorphousness and genuine amateurism of the work , in terms of both the process and the results while chris burden reduced the agony of his various performances to single shocking instants that years later still have the power to make a searing impression on the mind , orlan s travail goes on and on , becoming a tedious blur of needless suffering laced with a narcissistic stoicism and a desperate need for attention orlan s ultimate goal is equally amorphous and , despite its trappings of sensationalism , oddly esoteric a medley or blend , no less , of some of art history s greatest faces will anyone ever be able to tell if she has reached her goal \?

uniondale , li , april 24 the islanders are one victory away from winning a stanley cup playoff series for the first time in six years they took a threegamestoone lead over the washington capitals tonight by staging another dramatic comeback and scoring another overtime goal to clinch another victory once again , the hero was ray ferraro , this time in double overtime he beat rick tabaracci at 5 minutes 40 seconds after taking a pass from claude loiselle to clinch a 43 victory his wrist shot , between the pads , triggered another explosion of celebration from the capacity crowd of 16 , 297 as ferraro jumped for joy , spotlights illuminated him , confetti filled the air , his teammates mobbed him and darius kasparaitis threw his stick in the crowd as a souvenir for the roaring fans two nights ago , ferraro scored in the first overtime to give the islanders another 43 victory in game 3 two days before that , in game 2 , he scored to give the islanders a 54 victory in double overtime , although the official sheet gave brian mullen credit for the goal i dream about this stuff every day , said ferraro the only other thing i dream about is hitting a home run in fenway park but i do n't want to keep going overtime all the time i'm not getting enough sleep the islanders are 287 in playoff overtime games in their 21year history washington held a 30 lead early in the second period and a 31 lead at the second intermission , the second consecutive game new york had faced such a deficit but the islanders tied it up at 33 with two goals in an 80second span in the second half of the third period the first was by travis green , who had n't scored since feb 16 he steered in a long , lefttoright pass from loiselle with the crowd still celebrating that one , patrick flatley made it 33 at 14 14 by jamming the puck past tabaracci as flatley and ferraro crowded the slot in pursuit of uwe krupp s rebound not surrendering tabaracci is n't about to concede the series i know we 're a better team , he said i know , man for man , we 're stronger we have to forget about it and get ready for the next game they won three in a row and it s time for us to do the same they 've got our number in overtime right now i'm just glad it s a sevengame series vladimir malakhov scored the other goal for the islanders , on the power play , their first goal with the man advantage in the series tom kurvers , their powerplay specialist , was in the lineup for the first time in the series the power play went 1 for 5 and threatened frequently al iafrate scored twice for the capitals and mike ridley got the other goal we have to learn how to win , iafrate said we 've learned how to get the lead now we 've got to learn how to play with the lead penguins next \? glenn healy stopped 37 shots and made several key saves at several key moments the winner of this series goes on to face the winner of the pittsburghdevils series the penguins lead that series by three games to none , with game 4 sunday in new jersey iafrate , without a point in the first three games of the series , registered the first goal on the power play , at 3 22 of the first period , when he shot from the right point after the capitals won a faceoff and controlled the puck washington made it 20 , also on the power play , at 4 37 of the second period although the islanders had killed off a twoman disadvantage for 1 34 , they got caught in a ragged line change while still one man short after sylvain cote won the puck from malakhov in the corner , it came around to mike ridley , who beat glenn healy from the lip of the crease iafrate s second goal of the night made it 30 at 5 54 , this time after malakhov lost his stick the islanders protested that peter bondra had interfered with healy they did n't convince terry gregson , the referee , but later , gregson made a ruling in their favor on a similar play at a pivotal moment goal disallowed it appeared that washington had gone up by 41 at 10 15 of the middle period , but gregson waved off a todd krygier goal because kelly miller was guilty of crease interference during overtime , benoit hogue , ferraro and steve thomas had excellent scoring chances play was wide open and rugged , and gregson ignored many obvious fouls on a twoonone rush , loiselle took the puck to the left corner and opened his ears i was going to shoot it , he said , but ray was just screaming for it he was screaming so loud he kind of scared me so i passed
west palm beach , fla june s languor has settled on the rich green reaches of the palm beach polo and country club only the occasional golfer studiously addresses a ball on the shimmering , lush fairways , and there are just a few horses sheltering from the heat over at the cool emeraldpainted barns but the lassitude is deceptive , for the members of this haven for the moneyed are confronting a deeply unsettling matter the resolution trust corporation , the federal agency assigned to clean up the savings and loan mess , now owns the place , after a default by its previous owner , and will sell it at a public auction on july 14 maharajahs and stars even more distressing for a group of members who want to buy the club is what they call a nearbetrayal by the government they say they got a pledge from resolution trust that they would have an advantage over other buyers at the sale , but now they fear that the agency , in an effort to help the taxpayer by getting the best price , will sell to a buyer who will destroy the club s exclusive way of life from december through april , that way of life includes the polo , equestrian and golf matches that draw the rich and famous , from prince charles and sylvester stallone to the maharajah of jaipur , estee lauder and a slew of financiers but florida s sweltering june sees few visitors , and for those who came this year , one primary sport is gossiping about the prospective buyers , including local residents , bigmoney outsiders and the group of members who want to buy the club to preserve the place they call simply polo any third party is n't going to come in here unless they think they can make money , said tom hill , a retired lawyer from new york who formed the group of members that hopes to buy polo at auction members are concerned , he said , that to do that , a buyer would have to really go down market and try to entice people in here despite the pricey feel of the place , resolution trust has told prospective bidders that the club is losing money at the rate of at least 25 million a year also , the previous owner , the landmark land company , let a lot of maintenance slide so while the book value of the palm beach club is 544 million , the agency s estimate of its investment value is 249 million , and some expect it to go for much less none of the wouldbe purchasers will say how much they plan to pay in its continuing effort to recoup some of the billions taxpayers have lost in the savingsandloan bailout , resolution trust will sell the palm beach club at a public auction in dallas along with five other luxury clubs the agency got in the bankruptcy of landmark , a subsidiary of the oak tree federal savings bank of new orleans along with polo , these include kiawah island south of charleston , sc , and four california clubs pga west , la quinta , mission hills and carmel valley ranch the package has attracted a gaggle of prospective buyers who can afford either a single purchase or a sixclub package with a total book value of 739 million resolution trust will not tell , but among those known to have expressed interest in all six properties are marriott clubcorp kohlberg , kravis , roberts morgan stanley goldman , sachs maxxam mortgage colony capital , and one freshly announced contender , ross perot jr , the son of the presidential candidate any one of them , members say , would be more oriented toward the bottom line than would mr hill s group , which is described as a breakeven proposition for now , at least , polo remains an exclusive paradise the club has 45 holes of golf , 24 tennis courts , 12 polo fields and a polo stadium with yellowandwhite striped awnings that is perfect for advantageous display of the millinery that comes here in the seeandbeseen polo season the club also has an equestrian training and showing center , swimming pools too numerous to count , a nature conservation area , two croquet lawns lighted for night play , three clubhouses and much more , all nestled on 1 , 254 acres behind a discreet fence with security posts staffed by guards in addition , the privately owned pink , apricot , gold and white stucco condominiums and houses inside the fences are worth a total of at least a couple of hundred million dollars it is this that the craggyfaced mr hill , 68 , says he wants to protect he said he would not object to an outside buyer if that buyer wants to support me in the style to which i am accustomed but mr hill , an avid golfer who lives in a 2 , 500squarefoot town house here , sees more security in a members' purchase and claims to have commitments from 620 of the nearly 900 members , who would pay an agreedupon price some at the club question how much he can pay and the number of commitments he has but it is clear that he has substantial support , and he says the group will use a partnership with a real estate developer to preserve an atmosphere that the members are comfortable with many people here are sympathetic to his desires but it is far from certain that his group will win threestep process
washington , july 29 the papers keep writing that a handful of wise and crafty lawmakers are closeted this week in big mahoganyslathered rooms in the capitol , bifocals on and ties askew , reworking president clinton s economic package to meet congress s practical political needs literally , this is true but something altogether different is also going on the mahogany doors have been closed for two weeks now without results , and fear is mushrooming among the political animals outside rumor is riot , and everyone smells the annual august recess , now eight days distant , the way long horns smell water in cattledrive westerns and so the deliberative process of producing a budget compromise has lost much of its deliberation , and all its privacy the whole congress has elbowed its way in at least , all 314 democrats have and the craft of legislation has become equal parts istanbul bazaar , world wrestling federation and london during the blitz , waiting for the bombs to fall representative dan rostenkowski of chicago , the head of the house budget negotiators , is asked where the senate negotiators , led by senator daniel patrick moynihan of new york , stand on the issues a temper restrained i do n't know where the senate is ! he barks , then catches himself i mean , physically , i do n't know where the senate is he is asked whether the senate would pass a 65cent increase in the gasoline tax if it was included in the economic package they ca n't pass anything ! he catches himself again , and pins that opinion on the senate that s what they say i do n't know no one knows that is what has made these talks over mr clinton s proposal to raise 250 billion in new taxes and cut 250 billion in spending over the next five years so wrenchingly difficult , and so dangerous for the president presented with a vacuum in consensus , democrats of every stripe are rushing to fill it with propositions of their own , based on everything from lengthy analysis to undiluted politics , and frequently in direct conflict delicate alliances , toothpickandglue affairs built with months of persuasion , begin to fragment under the weight of anxiety and public pressure on the crucial question of a gasoline tax a bigticket moneyraiser whose revenue binds the entire economic package together , like mayonnaise in a tuna salad the deterioration is almost visible when house democrats approved their version of the package in may , they voted for a broadbased energy tax that included a 76centagallon tax increase on gasoline and would cost an average family nearly 15 a month today congress was gossiping about the prospect of a 65cent gas tax increase , costing an average driver perhaps 350 a month , and was balking at that counting drivers' dollars representative bill richardson , a new mexico democrat who is one of the house leadership s most energetic votecounters , called that figure saleable but representative charles w stenholm of texas , who voted for the energy tax in may , now calls the 65cent gas tax a middleincome tax , and predicts that the house would reject it over in the senate , herb kohl , a firstterm democrat who faces a potentially difficult reelection battle , voted for that chamber s 43cent gas tax in june now he looks at 65 cents an extra buck and a quarter a month , for average drivers and blanches above 43 , i would not be able to vote for it , he says back in the house , representative kweisi mfume , a maryland democrat and an influential liberal , strolls into an ornate hallway to promote another idea he would raise the tax rate on corporate income to 36 percent from 34 percent a point above the current proposal and use the proceeds to lower the gas tax and finance social programs mr rostenkowski hears that and erupts , knowing that would drive conservatives away in droves the corporate rate is agreed to ! he snaps , and walks into house speaker thomas s foley s office heavy courting by clinton so it went all day , one lawmaker floating a tax increase that affronted another lawmaker s stance on the need for balance between taxes and spending , that upset still another lawmaker s political necessities all linked , and none alterable without changing everything else there are two ways to break this gridlock mr clinton has been trying one this week , courting recalcitrant lawmakers with private visits in the oval office , pledges of future assistance and blandishments from other celebrities in the administration one holdout democrat , representative david minge of minnesota , said he believes the white house is collaring his local political backers and asking them to lobby on the white house s behalf to persuade senator dennis deconcini of arizona to switch from no to yes , the president not only dispatched interior secretary bruce babbitt a fellow arizonan and a logical choice but secretary of state warren christopher as well the other way is being practiced by mr rostenkowski and mr moynihan , who truly do gather in mahoganyslathered rooms , bifocals on noses , and grind away at the numbers with their cadres of aides 'i am not nervous' mr moynihan has been visibly gloomy about the pace of events lately , but today he was mum asked whether he was nervous about a senate defeat , he sniffled , fingered a package of decongestants , and evaded i am not nervous , he replied i am a man preoccupied with the question of how you get a cold in july and what the hell is coricidin d \? with that , he stalked into an elevator but mr moynihan and his fellow bargainers are nervous you want to think you 're making all the decisions for good policy reasons , said senator john d rockefeller 4th of west virginia , an earnest democrat who is that chamber s chief negotiator on healthcare spending in fact , decisions are being driven by another reason mathematics and some decisions are being driven by another kind of mathematics the ratio of spending to spending cuts 'a few nicks , that s all' bob kerrey of nebraska , a fiscally more conservative and even more earnest democratic senator , was derisive of the process in a different way the mood of the country is to cut expenditures , he said during a ride from the capitol to his office on one of congress s toy subway trains the leadership tells us we 'll have a chance to cut when the appropriations bills come up for a vote we all know what s going to happen on the appropriations bills nothing , a few nicks , that s all his argument was that coalitions of politicians are always at the ready to spend more money or protect existing programs , but rarely to cut programs or raise taxes they just voted 94 million this week , he said , for a courthouse i did n't even ask for , in omaha that is a truism , of course but rarely has it seemed truer than this week , when messrs rostenkowski , moynihan and clinton are trying to push , drag and seduce their party into approving what is , by most accounts , the largest tax increase and spending cut in any government s history can they do it \? miracles can happen , said representative william o lipinski , like mr rostenkowski a chicago democrat from a strongly ethnic neighborhood but mr lipinski voted no on the package in may , and so far , he said today , nothing had persuaded him to change his mind
be honest now you hear that a piece that can be billed as beloved national opera is coming to town does your pulse quicken \? are you immediately impelled to storm the box office \? in fact , those might be entirely appropriate responses in the case of dvorak s rusalka , which has its metropolitan opera premiere on thursday evening , in a production from the vienna state opera , designed by gunther schneidersiemssen and directed by otto schenk and the availability of a rusalka of the caliber of the slovakborn soprano gabriela benackova by itself goes a long way toward justifying the undertaking ms benackova left no doubt about her credentials for the title role in supraphon s latest recording of the opera , a decade ago it is in the booklet to that excellent recording that rusalka is billed as beloved national opera , and there is no reason to doubt the claim the subject matter reflects dvorak s strong interest of the period in czech folk materials , and at home the opera is said to trail only smetana s bartered bride in repertory appeal but abroad there may be less enthusiasm for a tale about the doomed love of a water nymph \( or rusalka \) for a human prince , populated by such other local talent as rusalka s father , the water sprite , the witch jezibaba and assorted other forest and water sprites against this lack of enthusiasm the crucial offsetting factor should be dvorak himself , especially when it is considered that the composer can be found here at the very height of his powers he was 59 when he completed rusalka , in november 1900 , and its high opus number , 114 , reflects the fact that by this time he had written almost all the music he would write the only major project that lay ahead was a final opera , armida in his late years opera came to matter a great deal to him in 1904 , several months before he died , he was able to tell an interviewer that in the last five years he had written nothing but operas , which he regarded as the most suitable creation for our nation opera had always been on his mind , though , even if his first halfdozen or so efforts left hardly a trace the string broke in 1882 with the first version of the historical drama dimitrij , whose subject matter is a sequel to mussorgsky s boris godunov although dimitrij would require revisions stretching into the mid1890 s , it was successful enough to encourage dvorak to try again , now seeking out consciously czech subject matter the jacobins \( 1889 revised version , 1897 \) concerns the return home , from revolutionary paris , of an expatriate czech couple about this time , something clicked for dvorak in common with many of his fellow artists he had been determined to create a native high culture in czech rather than german suddenly he was imagining art music from czech folk material , which yielded four lovely symphonic poems \( opp 107 to 110 \) as well as his next opera , kate and the devil \( 189899 , op 112 \) in this period he also had some contact with the music of janacek , with its freer , less regular setting of czech texts all these strands seemed to converge in rusalka , with a libretto by the prague national theater s young director of drama , jaroslav kvapil to describe rusalka as a fairytale opera , as is often done , is correct but misleading , especially on this side of the atlantic , where fairy tale suggests something disneyesque cute , light , safe , happilyeverafter rusalka is none of these things , as the somber and alarming overture , built around the poignant rusalka theme , immediately makes clear when rusalka reveals to her father that she is in love with the prince and wants to take on human form to do something about it , his answer is blunt there is no help there s nothing to be done once you 've succumbed to a human creature this proves to be more than mere parental disapproval of an unacceptable suitor the outcome is dire for both rusalka and the prince , and not exactly upbeat for the water sprite , the foreign princess who is in love with the prince , or rusalka s sister nymphs about the only one who comes out ahead in the deal is jezibaba , who derives no actual pleasure but has a personal stake in fanning confusion into mayhem she heaps rusalka with scorn even as she assists her in attaining human body and soul she warns that rusalka may not speak to humans , that if her love is wasted she will be doomed to exist alone and cursed in the mire of the lake , and that if her lover should follow her , he , too , will be eternally damned it might seem that an opera in which the heroine cannot speak to the hero operates under a severe handicap yet this limitation works out quite ingeniously in act ii , the impossibility of a duet underscores the futility of the relationship , and in act iii , when there no longer seems hope of anything , least of all a duet , it miraculously happens the courtship of rusalka and the prince is presented as a fait accompli after the rousing orchestral introduction to act ii , which sets the tone for the wedding festivities to follow , the audience is brought up to date in a scene between the gamekeeper and his nephew ,

conclusion
white plains , march 23 in a hallway at the schnurmacher nursing home here , a disoriented man sits in a wheelchair a piece of cloth ties him to the chair at his waist in such a way that he cannot remove it , keeping him from standing up , falling out , or wandering away what is striking about this patient is that he is the only one with a restraint everyone else on the floor and nearly everyone else in the building is free to sit and stand as he pleases the scarcity of restrained residents at schnurmacher is a sign of a quiet revolution in nursinghome care as recently as three years ago , 40 percent of nursinghome patients nationwide were held down in some way , either physically or chemically now those restraints are used on only 19 percent imposed from above the changes did not come voluntarily first the federal government and then a succession of states decided that restraints should be the exception rather than the rule in nursing homes the changes were not easy nursing homes had to alter their approach to patients providing exercise to make them stronger , activities to keep them interested , furnishings to keep them safer , properly fitting shoes to make them steadier on their feet and regular , assisted bathroom visits to keep them from trying to make the trip themselves the fact that it was so complicated to get rid of the restraints shows how completely we depended on them , said dr carole michelsen , medical director at schnurmacher , which is run by beth israel hospital in manhattan i would n't want to be restrained you would n't want to be restrained and yet it s something that was done every day changing that went to the heart of what we do nursinghome administrators say the reliance on restraints resulted in part from the belief that feeble , unsteady patients are safer when tied down also , government regulators penalized institutions in which many patients were injured in falls but did not penalize institutions in which many patients were restrained five years ago , the health care financing administration , which finances medicare , changed the regulations , saying that restraints could be used only when the patient could not be kept safe any other way state governments , which are charged with enforcing the federal rules , revised inspection requirements , questioning high restraint rates and allowing more falls by patients first reaction was fear the first reaction at nursing homes was fear restraints were so common that doctors , nurses and administrators knew no other ways to keep patients from falling and hurting themselves facilities were sure that patients would be standing up in their wheelchairs and tipping them over , said sheldon ornstein , director of nursing at the daughters of jacob nursing home in the bronx , where 50 of the 515 patients are in restraints , compared with 160 restrained patients in 1991 they were sure everyone would be breaking their necks , breaking their backs , breaking their legs the family members of nursinghome patients were wary as well we had to convince families to let us try this , said cheryl frenkel , associate director of nursing at the monsignor fitzpatrick skilled nursing pavilion in jamaica , queens , where the restraint rate is now 10 percent , compared with 30 percent three years ago we were asking them to weigh the gains of letting people roam around freely and possibly falling versus being in a wheelchair where they might be safer but where there would be no quality of life falls increased at first she and other administrators said that falls did increase as the restraints decreased most nursing homes refused to provide those statistics , but dr leslie libow , chief of medical services at the jewish home and hospital for the aged in manhattan , estimated that falls increased 50 to 75 percent right after restraints were removed , but soon returned to previous levels significantly , he said , the number of serious injuries caused by falls did not increase , probably because patients were no longer trying to climb over bedrails or wriggle free from wheelchairs , actions that can be extremely dangerous while the federal government required less restraint , it did not offer suggestions on how to do it it was a wonderful step by the regulators , dr libow said , but they did n't give us funds or instructions the first step , administrators say , is to evaluate each restrained patient , starting with a question why is the restraint necessary in the first place \? the answer has led to some surprising alternatives exercise helps for patients who slip from their wheelchairs , one solution is foamfilled wedges that attach to the chair seat , angling the patient backward another approach is an exercise program , helping even the most fragile patients to strengthen the muscles they use for sitting and standing when restraints cannot be eliminated entirely , they can be reduced the lone restrained patient in the hallway at schnurmacher , for instance , has alzheimer s disease and is too debilitated to sit independently and move freely he had been in an immobilizing bedchair when the regulations took effect and workers moved him into a less restrictive wheelchair when the problem is wandering from bed at night , sensors can be placed under the mattress when the patient leaves the bed , the sensors sound lower beds
just when you thought you could make sense of the art market , it threw yet another curve at christie s sale of impressionist and modern paintings , drawings and sculpture last night , there was surprising enthusiasm not only did the expected gems sell and sell well , but even the socalled middle market , those works in the 500 , 000 range that have suffered most during the last two years , made a comeback the sale totaled 485 million , slightly above christie s low estimate of 45 million , but well below its high estimate of 59 million of the 60 works for sale , 48 found buyers while the figures did n't compare with sotheby s impressionist sale on tuesday night , which totaled 759 million , christie s , anticipating less of a success , was ecstatic well over expectations there was more bidding than we 've seen in a long time , said christopher burge , the president of christie s in new york nine lots sold for over 1 million we did better than we could have possibly expected many dealers agreed the sale did remarkably well with average paintings , said daniel varenne , a swiss dealer christie s had brought prices down in the middle level , so there were good buys for collectors unlike the sale at sotheby s on tuesday night , which had three paintings estimated to bring over 4 million , the sale at christie s last night offered only one bigticket item monet s jetty at havre , from 1868 , one of the artist s two large seascapes before the sale , mr burge had estimated that the painting would bring 8 million to 10 million after fierce bidding in the sales room and on the telephone , it sold for 96 million to an unidentified private european collector the painting was being sold by motoaki ishizuka , a japanese inventor who is an active collector of impressionist and british paintings mr burge said there had been interest from museums before the sale , but last night bidding came only from collectors also highlighting the auction , and the cover of the sale s catalogue , was degas s russian dancers , from 1895 , estimated at 25 million to 35 million this work brought aggressive bidders and 62 million , nearly double the high estimate michael findlay , the senior director of christie s department of impressionist and modern art , said a big difference between christie s sale last night and sotheby s on tuesday night was that the buying patterns were very different at sotheby s , he said , there was an enormous difference between the top of the market , which had a lot of bidding , and the middle market , which tended to fall flat at christie s , there was bidding on nearly every lot in many cases , artworks exceeded their high estimates pissarro s boulevard montmartre , in the afternoon rain , from 1897 , for example , which was expected to bring 2 million to 3 million , sold for 33 million when that painting was auctioned on may 16 , 1977 , at christie s in new york , it brought 275 , 000 the price was high considering that four pissarros up for sale at sotheby s on tuesday night fared badly two failed to sell , and two sold , barely either at the low estimate or well below record set by a cezanne still nothing could come close to the big news of tuesday night when cezanne s still life with apples , from 189094 , brought a stunning 286 million , a record for the artist this was the first painting to bring more than 20 million in three years coming close , also at sotheby s , was matisse s fatma the mulatto , from 1912 , which sold for a whooping 143 million , 200 , 000 short of the artist s record by comparison , christie s sale last night , lacked such blockbuster material a matisse , laurette with a cup of coffee , which most recently belonged to imelda marcos , was a less important work christie s estimated that the work would bring 800 , 000 to 1 million it sold for 12 million recognition for a chagall chagall , whose work has been suffering for the last two years ever since the japanese dropped out of the market , made a surprisingly strong comeback at christie s flowers , from 1925 , which was estimated to bring 800 , 000 to 1 million , nearly reached its high estimate , fetching 992 , 500 it has also been a good spring for renoir , another artist whose works have had their ups and downs last night , there were eight paintings for sale one in particular , which caused a heated bidding war between three serious contenders , was leontine lisant , from 1909 , which was expected to bring 28 million to 32 it sold to an anonymous collector for 29 million at sotheby s on tuesday night , renoir s woman in the garden \( 1873 \) also provoked a bidding frenzy , eventually selling to a telephone bidder for 67 million , well above its 25 million to 35 million estimate alain delon , the french actor , put up six paintings for sale at christie s last night they sold , but for under their low estimates surrealist works have been plentiful this week , especially magrittes if sellers were hoping to ride on the coattails of the successful magritte retrospective at the metropolitan museum of art this fall , no one was saying the three magrittes up for sale at sotheby s on tuesday night bombed none found buyers at christie s last night , two of three sold the enchanted kingdom , from 1969 , a series of five paintings , each depicting images that appear throughout the artist s work , estimated to bring 1 million to 14 million , sold for 11 million the unveiled heart \( portrait of tita thirifays \) , from 1936 , thought to fetch 300 , 000 to 400 , 000 , was bought for 310 , 500 by scott black , a boston collector the third magritte , the folly of the majesty , from 1962 , is among seven surrealist works being sold by the menil foundation to benefit its acquisitions program it was among the biggest casualties in the sale it was expected to bring 900 , 000 to 12 million bidding stopped dead at 650 , 000 and failed to find a buyer another surrealist work , giorgio de chirico s ettore and andromaca \( apollo fulminante \) , was bought for 717 , 500 by the new york dealer william acquavella there was dealer bidding , mr burge said but in many cases , dealers were seen bidding for collectors , who sat by their sides patrick o'connor , a private new york dealer , sitting between two japanese spectators , bought victor brauner s folding head , from 1955 , estimated at 80 , 000 to 100 , 000 , for 123 , 500 and as usual , there was a bit of auctionroom quirkiness , which makes these sales such a popular spectator sport jose mugrabi , a columbian collector , did not bid the conventional way , by waving a paddle instead , he signaled to a christie s official with just a subtle movement of his pen photo monet s 1868 painting jetty at havre sold for 96 million over the telephone last night to an unidentified private european collector \( christie s new york \)
kindly inquisitors the new attacks on free thought by jonathan rauch 178 pages the university of chicago press 1795 the kindly inquisitors in jonathan rauch s fiercely argued new book are the antibigotry and antihate speech advocates who have recently begun to call for rules and regulations outlawing verbal harassment and restricting the spread of offensive words and ideas french laws , passed in 1990 , that outlaw historical revisionism questioning the truth of the jewish holocaust australia s 1989 ban on public racial vilification austria s 1992 decision to make it a crime to deny , grossly minimize , praise or justify national socialist crimes , and recent codes adopted by american universities prohibiting speech that can be construed as sexist , racist or antigay mr rauch cites such developments as distressing evidence that not only civil liberties but also the core principles of liberal society are under attack he vehemently assails the movement to identify and penalize false and socially dangerous opinions as a new inquisition many ideas in mr rauch s book will be familiar to readers of , say , nat hentoff s free speech for me , but not for thee and dinesh d souza s illiberal education what sets his study apart is his attempt to situate recent developments in a longrange historical perspective and to defend the system of free intellectual inquiry as a socially productive method of channeling prejudice as mr rauch sees it , all authoritarian attempts to regulate opinion can be traced back to plato , who advocated censorship of the arts \( for the greater good of the state \) and who believed that a few wise men or philosophers should be in charge of sorting true opinions from false ones plato s beliefs , mr rauch argues , are echoed in the ideas underlying the intellectual regime of khomeini s iran , a dictatorship of the wise just as offending artists were banished from plato s ideal republic , so was salman rushdie condemned as a heretic and sentenced to die by the ayatollah , who deemed his book the satanic verses offensive to islam s holy truths although the west recognized the fundamentalist intolerance of unorthodoxy implicit in khomeini s fatwa against mr rushdie , mr rauch writes , what was not so widely noted was the second dimension of khomeini s challenge the humanitarian dimension he adds this is not to say that khomeini was a humanitarian , only that the argument which his supporters commonly made was humanitarian in principle 'you have hurt us with your evil words , your impious words , disrespectfully and needlessly written in utter disregard of muslim sensibilities you have caused pain and offense to many people and this you have no right to do' this belief in the right not to be offended , mr rauch argues , has taken root in america in recent years while the empathetic spirit behind it cause no pain and allow none to be caused is admirable enough , the principle itself can have disturbing consequences after all , says mr rauch , the old papal inquisition used similar reasoning to rationalize its punishment of heretics the heretic endangered the faith of believers , and so threatened to drag others with him to an eternity of suffering in perdition not least of all , he threw away his own soul to allow such a person to destroy souls seemed at least as indecent as allowing racist hate speech seems today what mr rauch argues , and argues passionately in these pages , is that hurtful words and criticism are not the same as actual violence and should not be treated as such to abide by the doctrine of never offend would render all criticism morally hazardous and make even joking impossible , he contends it would also raise an old and troublesome question who is to decide who is allowed to upset whom \? the only answer , mr rauch reasons , is a centralized political authority , an authority that would inevitably act in behalf of the politically powerful in mr rauch s opinion , the proposition that a fair and completely neutral authority could be established is patently false does anyone seriously believe , he asks , that today s university antidiscrimination committees would treat offended leftwingers and offended rightwingers the same way \? or that they would treat offended creationists and offended racial minorities the same way \? he adds and what about the day when rightwingers get the upper hand \? will they be 'fair' \? people who like authoritarianism always picture themselves running the show but no one stays on top for long in the course of making such arguments , mr rauch occasionally overreaches himself for instance , in arguing that ayatollah khomeini s fatwa against mr rushdie represented a turning point in the fate of free inquiry and free speech , he condemns what he sees as the lack of response on the part of the west he contends a great many western intellectuals merely haggled with khomeini s sentence they repudiated the death sentence as barbaric , he says , but took issue with mr rushdie for offending muslim sensibilities in the first place such statements represent both an exaggeration of western reactions to the fatwa and gross generalizations about them , and they undermine the many valid and persuasively made points in this book photo of jonathon rauch \( richard a bloom \)

baltimore sixteenyear old taressa collins was home caring for her new baby the evening that politicians and clergy argued about the city s plans to offer the surgically implanted contraceptive norplant to high school students social engineering aimed at the poor , one opponent said a potential health hazard , others charged but ms collins felt the whole debate ignored the reality of her daily existence struggling against the fear that a baby would detour her dreams and ambitions as it had for so many women around her , ms collins was impressed by the simple fact of norplant s longevity its fiveyear potency would enable her to finish high school and maybe even some college without getting pregnant again pilot school program so while community leaders quarreled over the plan , first announced in december , ms collins made her own decision when a pilot program for norplant began at laurence paquin high school , a public school for pregnant girls and teenage mothers , she and several of her friends went ahead and got the implants in what is apparently the first such program for teenage girls in the nation i do n't know what i would do if i had another baby , said ms collins , a small , slim teenager whose mother and older sister had both dropped out of school to have babies i share a crowded bedroom with two younger sisters , and it s so small and cluttered with bunk beds and cribs i 've tried to find a job , but there are n't any , and my stepfather is out of work i want to go to art school , and i always dreamed of having fun on a college campus in ms collins s neighborhood , as in the rest of baltimore , about 10 percent of girls ages 15 to 17 have babies , one of the highest rates in the nation ms collins , who said she started having sex at age 11 , was 15 when she got pregnant like most young mothers here , she lives in poverty plans to expand program sitting at a formica table in a bright classroom , ms collins thoughtfully rubbed the underside of her upper forearm , feeling for the six matchsticksized implants that will release contraceptive hormones into her blood until 1997 the pilot program at her school is financed by a private foundation , and the city health department plans to extend it to five other high school clinics next fall i wanted norplant to help me finish school , she said with conviction and though she saw the implant as an effective contraceptive , ms collins had also heard the warning repeated like a mantra by city health officials , school administrators and other students norplant has no affect on sexually transmitted diseases i got counseling , went to a class and saw a movie about norplant , she said they make it clear it does n't protect you against stuff like aids you still have to use condoms most of norplant s opponents say they have no objection to providing contraceptives in baltimore s schools in fact , the city has been dispensing birth control pills , condoms and other contraceptives for two years at middle and high schools without complaints instead , it is norplant s fiveyear duration that drew the most fire from critics , who called the contraceptive unhealthy , maybe even sinister fear of social engineering' adding to their concerns have been sporadic suggestions around the country in the last year that welfare eligibility be linked to the use of norplant even gov william donald schaefer of maryland made such a suggestion in a speech last month councilman carl stokes , who had urged the council to conduct the hearing on norplant , alluded to those suggestions of social engineering in a recent interview you ca n't say to a poor person , 'you should n't have a baby because you 're too poor to have a family , ' he said but he added that a significant minority think poor people should n't have babies many of norplant s detractors have been worried by reports that norplant may cause irregular menstrual bleeding , hair loss or weight gain , and that teenagers who get the device and stop using condoms would run a higher risk of contracting aids is this safe for teenage girls \? councilman stokes asked , adding that he did not believe the health department could answer that question we do n't really have the data , he said there are no studies of teenagers they 're just extrapolating data from what happens with other oral contraceptives christine hohmann , a biomedical researcher at johns hopkins university , told the city council that none of the approximately 170 norplant studies on adults around the world were applicable to innercity teenagers medical worries irregular bleeding is the most worrisome if you are giving norplant to a population that does n't regularly see a physician , ms hohmann said it can mask things from ectopic pregnancies to ovarian cancer until the paquin program started , norplant was too expensive for most teenagers the drug itself costs more than 350 , and many clinics and doctors charge 150 to 500 to implant it the parents and students asked for this , said peter beilinson , the city health commissioner , adding that his office had had overwhelmingly positive reaction to the plan we are not imposing it on high school students we 're not promoting it we 're just making it available and the schoolbased clinics are the perfect site another 'menu item' every week , the principal of laurence paquin high school , rosetta stith , sees about 25 pregnant girls and teenage mothers who want to enroll for classes most girls wo n't use diaphragms or sponges , dr stith said or they wo n't take the pill faithfully so norplant is just another item on the menu to help them we 're talking about morality versus reality these choices give girls a chance to plan planned pregnancies are definitely what ms collins and her friends want the next time traychel mcleod , a 17yearold mother , said she had been on the pill but not taking it faithfully after the birth of her daughter , she got the implant at paquin now i'm planning to go to college , she said but i just found out that my little sister has started having sex , ms mcleod added she s only 16 now i wonder if i should tell her about norplant photos traychel mcleod , 17 , second from left , got the norplant implant at laurence paquin high school , a public school for pregnant girls and teenage mothers in baltimore , after the birth of her daughter now i'm planning to go to college , she said she practiced diapering a doll during a class we 're talking about morality versus reality , said dr rosetta stith , paquin s principal , holding two practice dolls these choices give girls a chance to plan \( photographs by marty katz for the new york times \)
xiamen , china , june 19 as the hogs outside grunted their protests at the drizzle , r t liang sipped cheap tea from one of his set of cracked cups and spoke of the beautiful country with a reverence that americans might find both flattering and unsettling the united states what a place ! mr liang said wistfully , as family members clustered around him in his home , next to a porcelain god of wealth apparently erected less in gratitude than in hope it s so rich ! if there were n't restrictions , everybody would leave here we would go to look for work in america , hong kong or taiwan if we could figure out how to get there , we would all go the villages would become empty mr liang is still searching for a way out , but tens of thousands of others from fujian province here in southeastern china have already found a path to mei guo , the beautiful country , as the united states is known in chinese fujian province , a lush green land of peasants , fishermen and perhaps more relevant smugglers , is the homeland of most of the 320 or so passengers on the golden venture , the ship that ran aground off new york this month the incident spotlighted fujian as the prime source of the deluge of chinese boat people seeking a new life in the united states three days of interviews here in southern fujian , from the noodle stands of xiamen to the tiny mud paths of the surrounding countryside , underscored how difficult it will be to control the migration the provincial government has just begun a crackdown on the snakeheads who organize the human smuggling , but it seems that for every fujianese who has made the journey so far , thousands more would like to join the line the reason for the migration is not exactly that the 32 million people who live in fujian are poor , for in fact they are richer than they ever have been , and fujian today is one of the more prosperous parts of china rather , the underlying factors seem to be the growth of the money culture , the rise of criminal gangs that arrange the smuggling , and the increasing boldness and mobility of peasants why do fujianese want to go abroad , even though we 're richer than other chinese \? mused a history teacher in xiamen as she munched on a 90cent bowl of beef noodles in a street stall we 're on the coast , and so we know more about what life is like abroad so while we 're better off , we also know more than people in other parts of china what we 're missing in a larger sense , the problem appears to be that the communist party is relaxing its grip , in some respects perhaps losing its grip , on peasants and workers party slogans no longer motivate people money has taken over that role and the authorities seem as overwhelmed by the boat people as by corruption , prostitution , narcotics , smuggling and crime the police do n't interfere , said a young street tough , who goes to work each day outside a xiamen hotel after all , this is the reform period , so they leave people alone having resolved the theoretical issue , he then tried to persuade a visitor to change money on the black market \( there s a very good rate today \) or to hire the services of a prostitute \( she s very cheap and convenient \) a model migrant ca n't get out in a creekside village 50 miles and a world away from the holiday inn , y h chen is the kind of cleancut , hardworking , ambitious young man who causes american immigration officials to tear their hair out mr chen , 27 , strong and sturdy , with a hint of a mustache , lives with his parents and some of his nine brothers and sisters in a grimy stone house decorated with pictures from a 1991 calendar mr chen has only onethird of an acre to support himself and his wife , so he has roamed the region trying to improve his life at times he found construction jobs paying about 30 a month , but they did not last long for a while he sold chickens on the free market here , winning business by charging low prices then the other sellers beat him up and drove him away in recent years , mr chen tried to sneak into taiwan and macao , but both times he was caught immediately and sent back the snakehead who arranged his trip to macao was a trickster , mr chen complained he promised he would have a good job for me , paying 3 , 000 yuan a month , mr chen said , referring to the equivalent of about 535 , a princely sum but it was all lies he cheated me he tried to join a migrant boat a few months ago , mr chen heard that people from a nearby village were arranging a ship to go to america , and he rushed over and pleaded to be allowed to join in but they were wary of outsiders and refused to allow him on board he has heard a rumor that they made it to the united states and now have good jobs , but he does not know if it is true these rumors take on a life of their own , and they help feed the desperation to leave i 'd love to go to the us , but i do n't know how , mr chen said , sitting on a tiny chair next to a faded old tea table you need lots of money to take care of everything , and we 're very poor here so there s just no way
